radioxenon,,1,04/18/2019,I was charged $8 for 2 minutes of riding which comes in at $240/hr.,"They clearly relay on false advertising which is pathetic. +$16/hr for a bike rental is usury to say the least. The fact that the pricing information is embedded five clicks down again demonstrates that this company is out to screw tourists and shirk any corporate responsibility. If you use this service read the fine print, know that after 90 minutes of bike riding you'll be charge $8/ 30 minute interval or fraction thereof. I was charge $8 for 2 minutes of riding which comes in at $240/hr which is my own little form of misrepresentation. I won't be using this company in the future and I can only imagine how many others have been burned by this company. Oh and one final note, the brakes on the bikes are crap."
Abigail B,,1,04/15/2019,"Random fees & absolutely no customer service -- don't use unless you're willing to pay $1,200 / bike","I live in the DC area and we've used the service a couple of times. It's such a great way to show friends the city. We used them most recently a couple of weeks ago for about two hours. We went to dock the bikes (there are guidelines for this, you watch videos, etc. to learn how) and began receiving texts that the bike wasn't docked. We returned to the docking station to make sure it was docked and did all their ""checks"" -- the bikes were docked. We called Capital Bikeshare three times and emailed twice that night, trying to solve the problem, but got no response. The next day we FINALLY got in touch with them and they immediately told us we'd be subject to a $1,200 stolen bike fee (?!). I explained the situation, that we had checked the bikes and tried to resolve the issue, and they said someone had JUST found the bike (?!) so they would make the feee $60 instead. I continued to ask questions and before long, when it was clear they weren't interested in what I was saying, I asked for a customer service number and the name of the representative. She said she didn't have to give me any information and hung up on me. I then contacted Lyft, the company who owns Capital Bikeshare, and was totally ignored for two weeks after multiple customer service tickets. (Keep in mind, they require your credit card info before you ride so they can charge you for anything they want afterward.) Ultimately, these bikes are a fun and cool idea. But know that if you ride them you're opening yourself up to $1,200 in fees if ANYTHING goes wrong (even if their technology fails!) with absolutely no customer service. I am not willing to take that risk, and unfortunately will not be using these bikes again."
jeremyraybrown,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",1,04/07/2019,SCAM ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!,"They have lots of crazy fees that are hidden in fine print. My wife and I rented 2 bike for fewer than 3 hours and were billed $92. NEVER use them. If you were to rent a few bikes for your family while visiting D.C. for just a half day, you could be billed $400 or more. This is a morally reprehensible business. They are evil. This is terrible. Check out my other reviews and you’ll find they are mostly joyful. That is proof this company is a special breed of con artist. I hate them as you can tell. The owner is garbage."
Ladymix17,,1,04/03/2019,I will never use it again.,"I recently bought a day pass for the bikes, rode them around while showing friends who visited from out of town around the monuments. Was charged $38, almost 5 times the amount for the day pass! They do not tell you at the kiosk or make it clear that you need to return the bike every 30 min and get a new one or else be charged extra fees- what’s the point of having a day pass then?! Its ridiculous and just stupid. What a waste, I could have gone with a cheaper option. I’ll be making sure to never use them again."
Lindsay K,,1,03/31/2019,Terrible Experience,We were on the bikes for an hour and they were great. Docked them properly and the green light turned on. We got a text saying they were docked properly and now we are being charged for not doing properly and calling and emailing them they hung up on us and refused to listen.
mjanep,"Boston, Massachusetts",5,03/31/2019,Great bikeshare program and app,"I think many negative reviews are due to user error. You have to understand that the rented bike must be returned within 39 minutes to avoid extra payment. I did 3 day rental, big savings vs. renting per day. Using smartphone app makes it very easy to see where bikes are available and where docks are free to return. The app can help plan a trip, and it shows preferred bike routes which are safer and less hilly. Much better than my home city app for its bikeshare program. Bring your helmet and then get out there to enjoy getting around DC!"
Thejammar,,1,03/20/2019,DO NOT USE,"Horrible experience. Rented bikes for less than 30 minutes. Returned and locked. Was charged $94 since it was ""out for 1 day and 3 hours."" They told me the docking light never turned green?? They were so generous in cutting my fee in half to $47 - only 5 times what it costs to rent for a day anyway. Don't waste your money or time with these people."
Tara W,,1,02/25/2019,Take an uber or rent a scooter,"Took the bike for what I thought would be a $2 and was charged $94 for ""improperly docking"" - I waited 30 to 45 seconds to see that the bike was fully locked before leaving the bike. I called to explain what happened and they didn't do anything. There were no reports of damage to the bike and it was docked the following day according to the manager. However, I am still required to pay over $40. This would have never been an issue had I taken Uber or rented a scooter, but I was hoping to save money."
GDJ13,"San Diego, California",1,01/01/2019,"Two bikes, $76 for 2 hours","Although we had fun riding in DC, I am annoyed that we were charged an additional $60 for unknown fees.  We chose the 24 hour option and rode for 2hours, total charge $76!!!"
Marissa M,,1,12/30/2018,DO NOT DO IT,"Worst mistake of renting a bike. We were exhausted from walking and in a sketchy part of town at night, trying to quickly access a bike and didn’t realize what we agreed to. We rode to the Lincoln memorial, parked, walked 5 steps away and took a picture and someone rode off on our bikes. On the scooters (that we used all day but we’re dead at this time) they had GPS’s and you can end your ride immediately if someone takes off on it. We didn’t realize the bikes weren’t like that (first time using it) and were devastated when they were gone, and read the “you’re responsible for up to $1200 if bike is not returned” part. Called customer service immediately and the nice lady reassured me if whoever stole them returned them, she would waive the fee. Well, the man I talked to today said he would not be able to do that and was super rude and said “well I could get my manager to review it but we don’t normally waive fees.. but like at least they returned the bike”... yes we’re SUPER grateful they returned the bikes... but it was 14hrs later (have to turn them in every 30min for no overage charges) so we were charged $94 each for a BIKE that we rode for maybe 20 minutes because we “abandoned it”... at the time I was frustrated because he was making it seem like I was lying to him about the lady saying she would waive the fee, so I said forget it because he was SO rude. It was a good 20 minutes while it lasted but if you’re in DC don’t you dare get off that bike at ALL for anything at all or you’ll be charged out the butt for a bike that isn’t even worth that much money. Rent a scooter, it’s cheaper in the long run and has a GPS. The lady in customer service was awesome, but the man who I spoke to today should not be in customer service at all. Such a shame because we enjoyed the bikes but we will not touch one again due to this awful experience. Find a different bike service. Get a scooter. Anything other than being possibly responsible for a $1200 charge for a freakin bicycle."
Lisap1971,"Ashland, Kentucky",1,12/27/2018,Do not do this,"We were visiting DC and my kids had rented scooters to get around town a couple times. There were none available so the decided to rent bikes. My daughter left one unattended (although in her line of site) briefly and it was stolen. She honestly didn’t understand how this worked. The kids assumed it worked like the scooters. We called the company who is of no help. They tell you to call DC police (yep, they’re super concerned over a stolen bike). Bottom line, my credit card was just charged $1200 for a maybe $200 bike. Just walk or get a scooter or buy a cheap Walmart bike and leave it there. It’ll be WAY cheaper. Zero stars if possible. "
Louise4travel,,1,11/05/2018,Do not move unless Capital Bikeshare says the bike is locked-and still no guarantee.,We rented 4 bikes in DC. Read the confusing fine print about the 30 minute docking requirement. Ok. Got it. Docked the bikes the first time and got notice that 1 was not locked. Confirmed all bikes were locked (could not be moved) and left to tour monuments. Came back 1 hour later and could only take 3 bikes because it said 1 was still out. That serial number was no longer there. We called company. They said it happens all the time and whoever took bike next would be docking it within 30 minutes. It is 24 hours later and the bike is not returned. Now they are telling us to file a police report. Police say it needed to be filed when bike was noticed it was missing and we are no longer in DC. Police also said they get tons of reports that this happens all the time. We are now being held responsible. Look at the screnshot of my texts. Notice how I get a text that the bike W20305 was docked and later get a text that it wasn't returned. We spent as much time calling their customer service as we did touring the sites.
Go12469605138,,1,11/01/2018,Capital Bike Share,Be aware of this bike share. There was no where on the screen that said you had to dock your bike every 30 minutes on a 24 hour pass. They charged our account over 100.00 extra instead of the 8.00 for 24 hours that you think you were paying. I read the instructions for 20 minutes and if there was a notification then its not visible and who wants to dock a bike every 30 minutes that is not long enough to tour anything and its also unnecessary its a Scam... Also be aware they will charge you 1200.00 for a 80.00 bike if you lose it.
dolphinchicks,,4,10/14/2018,Great way to get around,"We stayed a few blocks from the Capitol building and did not have a car. These bikes were our mode of transportation for 3 days! It was great. I will say, we had a few issues with the docks, but we worked it out. The ride from the Capitol to Lincoln Memorial was fantastic...especially at night! The ride back was a little rough...hence Capitol Hill - there really is a hill! There are docks everywhere! Give it a try...saves your feet and legs! And... the kids loved it! We had four teens and preteens...this was one of their favorite things to do!"
Jean S,,3,10/14/2018,Checking in every 30 min,"Which is ridiculous when you have a whole day pass!!! 
The system keep charging for 60 and 94 which I had to call to get refunded. Beware of them continuing to charge your credit card."
760es,"Upper Montclair, New Jersey",3,10/10/2018,Ride,"This service is an asset, not unlike the Citi bikes you will find in NYC. You will find docks of bikes throughout Washington and with a little patience you will be on one or two of these bikes to explore the city. My only grief was trying to get up and running as that process is far from intuitive. After downloading the app, selecting your bike, I confess it was not clear at first where one enters the code generated by the app to release the bike. Once we got that ironed out, we remained mindful that we only had 30 minutes to get them back to one of the docks, which we did but there was more confusion on our part on how to successfully lock them back up. Thankfully, I had a 13 year old in my company who diagnosed that problem but again, none of this is intuitive. The key is sorting all of that out in advance AND knowing how long you need the bike for. If 30 minutes puts too much pressure on you, I would opt for the longer periods as the increase in rental rate is not that cost prohibitive - it sounds like it is costly otherwise if you poorly estimate how much time you need."
255103Julie,"Perth, Australia",3,10/05/2018,Aussies unable to hire,"We were keen to ride around National Mall on a couple of bikes as it was a hot day. Unfortunately after trying to insert our credit card to obtain a ‘key’, it was rejected. Upon calling customer service we were told it was because our credit card wasn’t issued in US?! Ummmm, we are overseas visitors, of course we wouldn’t have a US credit card. We kept on trying as were advised to use the app. That proved unsuccessful too as we were unable to enter our Australian mobile number with the +61 prefix. It appears it’s only possible if you are a tourist from another state in USA. A little disappointing. We ended up walking..."
Тихомир П,,1,10/04/2018,"Rip off, even when you stop every 30 minutes","I was charged for almost $100, although I returned bikes on every 30 minutes... Story was that I did not dock bike (I did it almost 10 times that day) and that it was in use for 2 days and 20 hours... rubbish."
ukkim1958,"greenville, in",3,10/02/2018,"Fun ride, but tedious also ","Rode for nearly 4 hours today, capital one arena to all the memorials, around the White House, up to The Capital, Supreme Court, then back to the White House! A total of 21.7 miles! The tedious part is I had to dock my bike 8 times to avoid being charged for overages!! Good thing I downloaded the app or I wouldn’t have known to dock it every 30 min.Also, a note to riders, DC streets are very dangerous to ride on! Very very few bike lanes! And very very fast and testy car drivers!! So ride on sidewalks and paths when ever possible!"
Hobocht,Austria,1,09/25/2018,ATTENTION - total Ripp-off,"At the rental station is a price of 8 USD per day defined .... we took the bikes for 3 hours and finally 90 USD for each bike got debited of our credit card. The customer service refer to the ""small printed"" where the exact rate is defined. DON'T DO IT ... this are thieves"
PeterB11384,"Athens, Greece",4,09/24/2018,Convenient way of exploring DC,"In my opinion distances in DC (Mall, downtown, Dupont, Georgetown) are a bit too big to walk, a cab is often stuck in traffic and the subway stations don't cover the entire area nicely. So, there is a transportation void that bikes can fill perfectly. I loved using Capital Bikeshare for short urban trips. The bikes were OK (maintenance could be better) and there are many docking stations in the area. A bit of caution is needed: don't use your bike for longer than 30 mins in a row and plan carefully for the docking stations. They can be either empty (no bike available) or full (you can't park your bike there)."
Flyer816378,"Langwarrin, Australia",1,09/17/2018,RIP OFF!!,"Absolute rip off!! Hired 2 bikes and rode around dc.. expecting an $8 fee for each bike.. next day checked my credit card and $230 Au dollars taken out of my account... When I rang to question it, I was told about the parking it every half hour and you should’ve read the tiny screen.. all 100 pages of it.. They then offered to halve the charge which means $115 Au.. very expensive bike hire indeed tourist stay away"
S A,,1,09/15/2018,Nickel and dime you along with poor customer service,I rented three bikes. Returned all three and received text that one was not docked. I was forced to drive 35 minutes to where the bike were returned to check. All of them got a green light and would not come out after docked. Called customer service who started they received a error that started we didn't dock the bike correctly. She told me if she sent someone out it would be a extra fee. I went back to the place where the bikes were returned and they were locked into place. I will never rent from this place again. Save your money because they'll find a way to over charge you extra. Horrible!!!
Chelsie Z,,1,08/20/2018,Dock Every 30 Minutes!,"I went to visit some friends in the DC area. A few of my friends used JUMP to get an electric bike and I thought I was saving money by using Capital Bikeshare because it was $8 for a 24-hour membership. If you take a bike out, make sure you dock the bike every 30 minutes and rent it out again or you will get charged a late fee of $30 dollars. It is extremely sneaky and no one who is going around to see the sites are going to focus on how long they have had the bike out. It is absolutely heartbreaking that a trip of a few hours cost me $38 because I was unaware of their late charge policy. Capital Bikeshare, if you are reading this, please please please change your business model. This is seriously awful. I can either keep the bike for the time period I need or I will have to dock the bike after 30 minutes and rent it again. Your competitors in DC (JUMP specifically) are way ahead of you. I really regret not using them and I will not be using Capital Bikeshare again until they stop ripping tourists off."
Lindsey C,"Columbus, Ohio",1,08/20/2018,Read the fine print,"You must read the fine print. We thought this would be a perfect way to get from Falls Church to The Mall (a little over an hour ride on these bikes) but we didn't read the fine print. The $8 for a ""24-hour rental"" covers as many 30 minute rides as you want in a 24 hours. If you do not dock or switch bikes every 30 minutes you will be charged a late fee.I will say there numerous stations to make this possible but to need to set a timer to switch bikes to avoid a late fee makes this not worth it."
Tsukiji,"Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania",4,08/13/2018,Great way to get around the Mall,"It was a bit confusing at first to figure out how to rent, but once we downloaded the app it was much easier. We rented at the Jefferson Memorial, road to Lincoln, walked to DAR, road back to Jefferson. The only hiccup was at the Vietnam Vets Memorial the bikes were all gone so we had to walk another block to pick up more (not an issue) and then when we wanted to return them the rack was full back at the Jefferson Memorial. Keep that in mind and think about alternative drop/pickup points an all is good. Bikes were easy to use, a bit heavy but that is to be expected and made for a great time."
SOECC2018,"Arlington, Virginia",1,08/13/2018,Suspicious Business Model - behind the fantastic idea!,"The purpose of Capital Bike Share seem's to be ""Declare Your Independence"" to the customers. But the truth is a Suspicious Business Model based on Intentionlly Misleading of the Prices. Very misleading unless you read the fine print. The rent station says. $8 for 24 hours. Most tourist just read that and rent a bike. You have to bring the bike back to a station, dock it within 30 mins and then you can rent it out again. We got popped $38 dollars each bike. Now when you are riding around looking at the attractions in DC, who is going to return a bike to a station that are spaced 1/4 mile apart. Honestly, it is the whole idea and unbelievable that partners like: Arlington County, The City of Alexandria, The Fairfax County can accept this. The tourists are left back with a feeling of Misuse credit card. And, when I called to get my refund, rep told me they get these calls all day long. What does that say for their program? Dishonest Business Based on Intentionally Misleading!!!"
Snot_Finder,Wyoming,5,08/11/2018,Read the rules,"This is the BEST way to get around central DC, the mall, and the monuments. Read the rules. Plan on short trips and turning in the bikes or exchanging them before 30 minutes expire. The app is very helpful. There are docks near every major site you might want to visit. Make sure you securely dock the bikes - green light."
Michael G,,4,08/06/2018,Fun way to see the town,"We spent an afternoon riding from the Lincoln memorial to the Capitol Building making many stops along the way. It was an amazing way to see the monuments, reflecting pond, mall, WWII, and so much more. Tip, once you have your bike hang on to it. These things are in high demand."
Colette P,,2,07/31/2018,Misleading pricing,"Be sure to read the pricing breakdown before renting a bike. All bikes are rented out at 30 minute intervals, even if you purchase a 24 (or more) hour pass. After the first thirty minutes, you will continue to be charged unless you return that bike and get a new one. This is not clearly laid out when you look at the pricing options and can run up your bill."
d3691g2170w,"Dallas, Texas",1,07/31/2018,Misleading,"Very misleading unless you read the fine print. The rent station says. $8 for 24 hours. Most tourist just read that and rent a bike. We made the mistake of not reading the fine print. There are usage fees. You have to bring the bike back to a station, dock it within 30 mins and then you can rent it out again. We got popped $28 dollars. Now when you are riding around looking at the attractions in DC, who is going to return a bike to a station that are spaced 1/4 mile apart. Worst concept ever for tourist. And, when I called to get my refund, rep told me they get these calls all day long. What does that say for their program? Misleading!!!"
CindyMcN,"Charlotte, North Carolina",4,07/30/2018,Fun way to get around,I love to ride bikes so whenever I can find them and it helps with all of the walking I definitely will ride a bike. The only downside to docked bikes in cities is that you have to dock every 30 minutes or you get charged extra so that adds a little anxiety to the ride but other than that the price is right and saves a lot of steps. It is also great after a large dinner to burn off some calories. We bought the 24 hour pass and road quite a bit but one of the nicest rides was around the tidal basin. They have the basket type area in front but what would also be nice is a bike lock and the option to grab a helmet somewhere. Definitely recommend and have fun!!!
nkharris101,"St. Albans, United Kingdom",2,07/30/2018,Beware Bikeshare! Scam charges,No response so far. Please can someone contact me to confirm why I have been charged so much?My husband and I took 2 bikes out after paying for 2x 24hour passes. We got them from near Library of Congress and returned them in Georgetown about 2-2.5 hours later. Even your app confirms what I SHOULD have been charged. It logs the rides and how long between each docking. We paid for 2 bikes 24 hour hire. What an absolute scam!We’ve now been charged $60? It should have been $16. 
slcd2014,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5,07/29/2018,Great way to get around city,I came to DC with my 11 year old and we got a three day pass on Bikeshare - fun way to get around the city - best on the Mall - fun to be sure to dock within 30 min to not pay more. We did a monument ‘tour’ ride at night - safe and fun - less expensive and adaptable than a guided tour - the monuments have stations nearby and you can dock and then take the same bike back out
millergal88,Minneapolis,1,07/20/2018,Couldn't get a bike,"First stop only one bike. Went to the next. 2 bikes, one had a flat. Call them and they tell us a station near by with 6 bikes. Get to the 3rd station and only 3 bikes. Just as we paid 2 people had swabs and left us with one bike. Had to call to get our money back and gave up. It was a weekday in early June."
JenniferF520,"Rockaway, NJ",4,07/19/2018,Shocked by the bad reviews,"My nephew and I rented two bikes right on the mall. They were absolutely the highlight of the trip. I LOVED how much fun it was. I came here to leave a review and was shocked at how awful some of the reviews are. I had such a positive experience.The first place we stopped to rent bikes had a line, and only a few bikes, so we kept walking. About a half mile later, we found another rental spot with lots of bikes and nobody waiting.I did find the cost explanation posted to be very confusing. It was also not easy to read the tiny screen in the bright sun. But in the end, we got it figured out, and rented two bikes. My credit card was immediately charged $4 for two bikes for the first half hour. Let me tell you, the mall is huge. So riding down the sidewalk to the Lincoln Memorial was the best way to travel. We saved so much time! And it was so much fun! I haven't been on a bike for 15 years, and it's true what they say. You never forget how to ride a bike.The only drawback was the fact that there were so many people everywhere. It was hard to ride in that area, because of course, pedestrians have the right of way. The bikes had little bells to warn people you were passing, but most people really weren't paying attention to that. We kept our bikes a bit over the 30 minute limit, and when we docked them near the White House (I found docking locations on google maps) we were charged an additional $4 for the next half hour. Still, $8 for two bikes for 45 minutes was well worth it!I did have a little trouble docking my bike. I kept slamming it into the docking station, but never got the green light. My nephew had a softer touch, and he pushed it just a little bit tighter, and got the green. I liked having that reassurance that the bike was officially returned. I also liked that the docking station had a place to indicate if the bike had any problems associated with it, so it would be checked before being rented out again. I would absolutely get one of these bikes again, but perhaps during a less crowded time of year. I would also recommend the powers-that-be try to simplify the cost structure. It was too confusing."
Alina A,,1,07/17/2018,AWFUL,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. I normally am very passive/do not give bad reviews, but felt this was such a scam. We bought the 24 hour pass for 2 bikes, which was $16 total. We wanted to visit the monuments in D.C. and ride around the city. We were out for about 2-2.5 hours.... I was charged an extra $56 because we didn't connect the bikes back to a dock within 29 minutes of riding them, and they charge you $8 PER BIKE PER HALF HOUR over 29 minutes!!! This should've at least been clarified better when checking out. Was not happy with my experience and ended up paying almost $100 for this scam of a service."
Jonathan H,"Chesapeake, Virginia",1,07/01/2018,Ridiculousness ,"We visited DC with our family, and decided to try the bike rentals out. It was an absolute disaster. You can only rent 2 bikes at a time. How does a family of 4 or more rent bikes? Someone needs to adjust this option. Then, we tried to rent 5 bikes in 3 different purchases, and that proved unsuccessful. By the time we were done there were not enough bikes. My wife had to walk. Never again!"
Rainer V,"Scotland, United Kingdom",1,06/28/2018,Beware of costs,We were recommended this by our host. We purchased a 24 hour pass for $8 each after reading the information on the kiosk Toured around with the bikes then docked the bikes as per guidance when finished. However we were then charged $60. On contacting Capital Bike share they said 'You purchased a access pass which granted you access to the bikes for 24 hours but you were still required to dock the bike every 30 minutes to avoid additional fees.'Insane to think you have to dock every 30 minutes! Capital Bikeshare have refunded 50% of costs. Not to be recommended. 
V L,,2,06/27/2018,Check bikes out before renting!!,"I purchased a 30 minute $2 ride so I could bike around the Lincoln Memorial. At the time I didn't know to check before paying that a) enough bikes were available that weren't docked with red repair lights (those are locked into the docks and cannot be checked out) and b)unclaimed by jerk tourists who hadn't even paid yet but ""claimed"" them for their large families. The code the kiosk gives you is only valid for 5 minutes for the $2 ride, so needless to say I wasn't able to unlock a bike before it expired. Thankfully it was only $2 I wasted! The kiosks do not tell you that a red light on a bike's dock means it cannot be checked out. I went to another station and 3 broken bikes were there but no working ones. Made it to station #3 and grabbed the one working bike of the 5 docked. On the way to finally getting a bike out I saw a few people also pay for bikes they couldn't use and there's no way to refund your money.Once I had a bike though it was pretty nice. The handlebars were sticky, but what can you do? At least I got a bike. Finally."
mtnmvr1,"Greenwood, South Carolina",2,06/26/2018,Kiosk vs App,"If you use the kiosk to get your pass, you cannot use the app. You have to use a credit card EVERY TIME you check out a bike. Twice I was trying to get a code and all the bikes were taken while I was doing so. I call customer support to be able to use the app twice. They were rude and would not help me. I was stuck walking. "
onelady467,"Helsinki, Finland",1,06/21/2018,Do not purchase a pass from a Euroopan phone,The app works well through the hotel wifi but not with mobile data at the kiosk. Purchased a three day pass but could not use at all.
PixelPrincess_2011,"San Francisco, California",5,06/18/2018,Great option for getting around quickly,"I wanted to get from the National Portrait Museum to the White House but it was more than a mile away. I saw these bikes nearby so I rented one. I loved tooling around DC on this bike! There's even a bike path down the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue. I wouldn't leave the bike unattended as there's a $1200 replacement fee, but if you want a quick way to hit the monuments in a drive-by manner, this is for you. $8/day is a great deal."
Stacy R,"Gloucester, Virginia, United States",5,06/10/2018,Highlight of our trip,"We rented 4 bikes on the night of June 10th to ride and see the monuments lit up and when they are less crowded. It was the best part of an already great trip. I had downloaded the app and understood that we needed to dock the bikes within the 30 minute time frame and with the map on the app it was easy to plan where to begin our ride so we could end up back at our car later. The entire trip was about 3 hours and we would have kept going except it began raining. Once in the car I got the texts the company sends saying the bikes are docked but I didn't realize until we were back at our hotel in bed that only 3 of the 4 bikes had docked. I called the company and the suggestion I go back to the docking station at 2 am to redock it was laughable. I explained that was impossible since it was the middle of the night, kids are asleep and it's raining out and I knew the darn thing locked in since we tried pulling them out when we docked to make sure they were locked in. They sent someone the next morning and I got a text at 6am the bike docked. I then called them and they took the charge off my Credit Card. Good customer service but having worked for attorneys I knew worse case scenario I could and would dispute the charge and force them to waste the money taking me to court of need be. But only because I knew the bikes locked in with no doubt. Overall go for it.....rent the bikes. Have a blast and make sure you get a green light when docking even if it's pouring down rain."
Larry-Crystal,"Florence, Oregon",4,06/07/2018,Great way to see the Capital,We decided to ride these bikes because it seemed more convenient than public transportation to see many sites around the Capital. We were right and this was REALLY FUN! The city isn’t exactly bike friendly so we rode amongst pedestrians on sidewalks but it was easy and we covered a lot of ground.Our only issue was a rear brake that would bind up on one of the best bikes and so we reported this by phone to a helpful and cheerful representative.This was really a great experience for us and we will definitely do it again. The bikes were great quality and easy to adjust seat height etc.
Rieneke1970,Zaltbommel,1,06/02/2018,Problems with docking costs 1200$,"I had a red light while docking, but could not move the bike in or out. So, I thought it could not be stolen either and that it was put away appropriatly. However, I couldn't take out another bike at a nearby station, so I asked a staf member who was at that station what to do. He told us that he would solve the problem immediately and sent someone over. However, he didn't solve it and 3 phonecalls later, no one solved the problem either. They told us that we will probably have to pay $1200. Advice: don't use city bike share and if you do so, keep hold on to your bike till you see on your phone that the problem is solved. Even when it is in the middle of the night one nobody picks up the phone nor a service vehicle is available...... "
Fred3nPhx,Arizona,1,05/24/2018,Very poor app,"I started out thinking the Capital Bikeshare app was very useful, until I got past the first level. There is no obvious way to create your account prior to buying a pass, unlike every single app in the world where the first thing you see is a button to create an account. So instead of entering credit card information and everything else they want to know in the privacy of my hotel room, the app requires you do that immediately before getting you bike while standing on a street corner. The app has a help section, but very little useful data behind it. I can learn that a ride of longer that 30 minutes costs more money, but not hour much more. Not useful. For all the money spent on the bikes and docking stations, it seems like a little more effort could be spent on the app."
Jennifer B,United States,5,05/08/2018,Highlight of my trip ,"I loved riding a bike throughout the District!There are docking kiosks everywhere. It is convenient and easy! You can download an app that shows you the one closest to you. I had two within a block or two of my hotel. You swipe your credit card and it gives you a code to punch in and unlock the bike of your choice. If you dock that bike and choose to get another later on in a different spot, swipe the same card and it will give you a new unlock code.I did the unlimited use for 24 hours. I think it was $8. In the morning I rode up Embassy Row, on to Washington Cathedral and then to American University. I docked the bike and ubered to Georgetown for brunch. From there I got another bike and rode to the National Gallery of Art. Docked the bike and saw some sights. Got another bike and explored Capitol Hill area, then rode back the Tidal Basin and on to Foggy Bottom. I was comfortable riding solo as a female. I used the nav on my phone to help me get around. I did not find traffic in most areas to be a problem at all. In congested spots I walked the bike on the sidewalk. I really loved this. Enjoy!"
Ash2212,"Portishead, United Kingdom",4,05/05/2018,"Easy to use, and a splendidly fab way to get to he main sites quickly","A friend recommended these to us as a great way to see the city if you are pressed for time. I couldn’t agree more. Fun, easy to use, central, plenty of parking places. Great idea for jetting about"
sheldon m,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5,05/01/2018,Great way to get around DC,"Great way to get around DC. Only problem is that the stations are not always that close to attractions. A few suggestions: It looks confusing to rent one but just follow the instructions step-by-step. When returning the bike, make sure the green light comes on.(You kind of have to REALLY jam the bike into the dock). The first fee is for only 30 minutes. After that, the price climbs. If you want to rent a bike for all day, rent from a local bike shop."
jlarsonaz,"Chandler, Arizona",5,04/28/2018,Great way to get around!!,Easy way to get around. Stations everywhere and plenty of bikes available. Easy to get most places within the 30 min included time. Highly recommended
marebear6589,"Bossier City, Louisiana",5,04/16/2018,Great way to get around the city,"We bought the 3 day pass for $17. Well worth it! We were able to get around DC so easily, and we were able to sight see so much more than if we would’ve lyfted everywhere. The only setback was that we couldn’t always find docks, but you can add 15 extra minutes to your ride if you’re nearing the 30 minute mark."
Autumn M,"Dallas, Texas",1,04/10/2018,Piece Of Junk Program!!,"Cut to the chase, if you want to rent bicycles for more than 30 minutes and you want freedom to go wherever you want in DC for a couple of days and then return a bike... Go to a local bike shop and rent one. No matter which program you choose from Capital bikeshare they force you to dock the bikes every 30 minutes. You basically spend your whole day going from Doc to Doc just to avoid their fees. This is the stupidest bike program I've ever seen!!!! It's even worse than limebike and I don't have very good opinions of that either! Just go to a bike shop rent the number of bikes you need for your family and have the freedom to go wherever you want without the hassle!"
NKTexplores,"Clive, Iowa",4,04/05/2018,"Easy transportation, read the fine print ","We rented bikes to get to the Nationals baseball stadium. The kiosk is straight forward to use. Definitely download the app so you can see where the docking stations are. There are a surprising number of stations (in a good way!) and after the game, we used the bikes to get to the Mall and see the monuments. As others have already said: be sure you understand the pricing structure. Other bikes in the area such as LimeBike can be a bit more convenient (the LimeBike I used came with a phone mount for using maps!) but they aren’t necessarily together in one place, so harder for a family or group to find and use. Also, beware if you’re on a schedule: if a docking station is full, they’ll give you an extra 15 minutes to take the bike to another docking station, so long as you request it from the full docking station. Not a big deal for a tourist but if you’re on a time schedule that could be a big hassle. Overall, the process was simpler than I expected as a first-timer and convenient bike station locations mean I’d recommend them for touring the Mall! "
ohiowills,Ohio,5,03/27/2018,"like the other reviews, you MUST know the guidelines before renting","Thank goodness I read the guidelines about having to turn your bike back in. I had intended to rent it for 3 days and thinking $17 was a steal. Glad I found out before we came that you need to ""return"" the bike every 30 minutes. After realizing that it was easy. We downloaded the app to our phone and there was always a bike stand within a few minutes walk near where we wanted one. My suggestion is to only drive to one monument or place at a time. In most cases 30 minutes is enough to get you there. We even rode from the Jefferson Memorial to the statue of Iwo Jima. it was really windy and we almost didn't make it there in the 30 minutes so would have been charged extra. We used them a lot the weekend of the March 4 our Lives event because there were so many people around. The bikes were great for us. Just make sure you understand how to use and rent them before coming. They aren't great for younger children. I would use a service like Bike and Roll to make sure to get them a proper fitting bike, helmet, and lock."
858michele,,4,03/09/2018,Great way to get around ,"This was a perfect idea for the summer. There are many bike stands in Washington. You can rent for a day or per hour. You won’t have many bikes available at monuments (lincoln memorial for example was a problem). We arrived there and put the bikes there but when we wanted to continue, none were available at that time. The APP lets you know how many bikes are available at what location. The only things that bothered me as a tourist there: what are the road rules for the bikes (they should add this at every location. Every country has its own rules. Can you ride your bike on sidewalks or in the parks etc.?). No helmets available. And when you get a day pass, you have to enter your credit card every time with your pin. So it wasn’t clear if they were charging me correctly. Other than that, great way to get around."
ramiroc848,"Cordoba, Argentina",3,01/03/2018,DC Bike rental on Thanksgiving ,"Renting a bike in DC is a wonderful way to explore the city in ways you probably hadn’t done before; especially on traffic-free days like a Sunday or a Holiday. We rented the Capital Bikeshare service nearby the Fed Reserve and returned it Georgetown. The bikes are in excellent shape and the rental procedure is straight forward; note that the service is designed for point A to point B transportation, not for daily continuous use, as there is a 30 minute limit per use. If bike is not exchanged within the 30 minutes, additional charges apply. It’s important to consider the above in comparing with other bike services; also mind that in heavy rental times you’ll have to search through various return sites. When we rented, most returning sites were full: the app facilitates this. Overall, the experience was good, but the somewhat sneaky fee & subscription service left a bad aftertaste, even though they refunded the excess charges. "
worldcycle38,,5,11/08/2017,Great Transportation Option ,"On my recent visit to Washington DC I took advantage of this service and found it to be a great way to get around. Just be aware that a bike rental is only for 30 minutes at a time. Easy enough though, just set a timer for 25 minutes and when it goes off, just find a docking station, dock your bike and start the process all over again. The only real downsides are that the docking ports aren’t always where you might want them to be and bikes are not always available. So using the app is of prime importance. Also check out Mobike, another great service where you just ride it somewhere and leave it. Bring your own helmet for none of these services provide them"
TravelLover59,"Navarre, Florida",4,10/28/2017,Perfect for Experienced Riders,"My husband and I rented bikes to save our sore feet and get from one end of the mall to another. It was okay for that purpose, but I discovered lots of pitfalls. It is difficult to ride with so may pedestrians. I found myself getting off of my bike to avoid hitting people or while waiting to go across crosswalks. In addition to that, you have to navigate broken pavement and other obstacles. After going from end of the mall to another, we returned our bikes rather than try to ride them back to our Airbnb in rush hour."
bielsk,Germany,1,10/26/2017,Day Membership Is Unlimited 30 Minute Rides- Not A Bike For 24 Hours,"I wish that I had read these reviews before renting the bikes as it would have clarified things. We saw people riding the bikes in town and thought it would be a great way to get around. We did enjoy our experience, but not the fees. They are intentionally unclear. Due to this ambiguity, we misunderstood the daily membership concept from the kiosks and therefore were charged $88 for using two bikes two times (roughly 2.5 hours and 1.5 hours) After calling to inquire about the fees, we now understand that it is $8 for as many trips up to 30 minute over the 24-hour period. Keeping it past 30 minutes costs additional fees, and these fees grow expedentially. The inquiry call did result in some money being credited back. The bike themselves were comfortable and had 3 speeds. We were were visiting the monuments and didn't find the station near the Jefferson memorial. (We were going off our memory from the kiosk by the Washington monument; perhaps the app would have helped.). When we got to Lincoln there were only 2 bikes in the kiosks and we consciously didn't turn in our bikes because we were afraid none would be there when we were ready to leave. If we had understood the concept, we could have checked them back in and then immediately checked them back out.I believe the cost structure is intentionally deceptive and therefore only give them 1 star. However, riding was fun and the metro involves a lot of walking to see all the monuments, so I hope they become more transparent and honest and that they offer a true daily rate."
Timothy S,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",4,10/25/2017,Careful but great,"i think capital bike share is a great opportunity where for only few bucks you can use the service all over the city.2 drawbacks1- you need to be careful to return your bike within 30 minutes or else you will be charged alot ! ( you can take another bike from the dropoff dock)2- You need to be careful that the destination station has empty docks, else you will need to ride to another place which might be far from destination and in the process exceed 30 minutes. My recommendation :1- install the app, and always make sure that at least 2 empty docks are free at the desired destination 2- plan 24minute trips, so whatever goes on your way, you will not exceed the 30 min threshold.finally i think this is a convenient way to commute since there are docks/ bikes all over the Washington DC and Virginia., and you do not need to worry to park your precious bike on roads, carry it on buses and metros. or leaving it in unsafe places.Hope this was beneficial"
virginiahome64,"Richmond, Virginia",4,10/23/2017,great way to see downtown dc,"great way to see highlights of dc in couple of hours. easy to use, and plenty of stations around. only downside is that of course most of the places you want to see are very crowded, so can be little difficult to navigate thru the crowds."
PhyllisNM,"Rockford, Michigan, USA",1,10/12/2017,Deceptive! Deceptive! Deceptive!,"I join the long list of reviewers who have been deceived by this company. One could, and did, assume that renting a bike for 24 hours for $8, means that you will be charged $8 for the use of one bike over a 24 hour period. WRONG! Apparently, and I could still be wrong, the $8 does cover 24 hours but, and this is the catch, you have to return the bike every 30 minutes. This makes no logical sense in any way except for the company who profits hugely for your stupidity. I recommend using the Metro. Your Metro card will work on both busses and rail or take Uber. You can cross Washington D.C. for less than $10 and they come right to your location."
ljtmontana,Great Falls Montana,3,10/09/2017,UGH....Read the Terms and Conditions and then READ THEM AGAIN,"We noticed these bike rental stations all around the downtown area the first few days of our trip, and decided to give it a whirl instead of taking a cab from downtown to Arlington Cemetery. The rental screen does not give very clear instructions. there is not a rental station anywhere near the Arlington park (as far as we could tell) so we parked our bikes, and completed the tour. We then returned to the downtown area and returned our bikes. We had the bikes rented for about a 5 hour period. When my card statement arrived, I discovered we were charged $46/bike...WOW so if you understand the rental agreement and return your bike every 30 minutes to a rental station, this idea is fantastic! Im just frustrated that the terms and conditions are not stated clearly. The app is great, it gives a map of all bike stations, and if bikes are available for rent. But I think we could have taken a limo to Arlington for what our bike rental cost...Live and Learn!!!"
TereBA,Buenos Aires,4,09/22/2017,Great quality city bike rental,"Very convenient to wonder around long distances in DC. The quality of the equipment is fabulous. Would recommend an extended time of rent, it's not that expensive.Loads of places to return them once finished.Somewhat complicated to understand steps to take to rent (payment and process to retrieve them) so be patient."
Bart B,"Perth, Australia",1,09/18/2017,Very sneaky and underhanded company ,We hired three bikes and rode around Washington DC on September 8th 2017 using the US$8 for 24 hours fee offered.Had a great time. Washington DC is a surprise and a delight. Capital Bikeshare was also a surprise but not so delightful. I later discover the fee only covers 29min rides. This was NOT clear when we selected the bikes. US$8 Became over US$100The pricing and advice of the pricing would be considered deceptive and misleading under Australian consumer law and is disgraceful by any standardsThat's why I am joining the many people on trip advisor [that I now see too late] have been equally deceived and ripped off by Capital Bikeshare.  
RyanAndTiffany,"Monroe, Ohio",4,09/17/2017,Under 30 minutes,"Capital Bikeshare is conveniently located around DC. Use the spotcycle app to find bikes and empty racks. This bike rental is ""geared"" for rides under 30 minutes to get you from point a to point b, not for crusing around the city.We rented 5 times over 3 days when our feet were tired and our trips where shorter than metro station distrances."
DAldred,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",2,09/17/2017,"Looks good, but useless for foreign tourists","Having seen the bike share locations, and read up about the pricing (see other reviews, and make sure you know the terms), I was keen to use bike share for our couple of days in Washington.But you put your card in the machine, and it asks for your phone number. It has to be an American standard phone number - no international code can be entered. Very disappointing - and no response at all to an email asking if there is any way round this."
Nicolas G,"Montreal, Canada",4,09/10/2017,So practical,"You can find stations almost everywhere in central DC. The app lets you see where they are and how many bicycles are available. Some bikes are a bit tired, so locate a station where there are many bikes, so you can pick and choose ones which are in better shape. They only have three speed bikes. They should consider adding the seven speed version. They are much nicer to ride. There are many paths. There is one in the middle on Pennsylvania avenue which is practical. There is one that runs along the Potomac, which is nice."
HolidayInTheSun26,"Ashburn, Virginia",1,09/05/2017,Great bike ride around DC but Beware of Pricing Rip-off,"Had a great day biking with my Daughter and her Boy Friend on a sunny day in Washington DC. Rented the bikes at a station in Arlington , had a slight seat problem so switched my bike without a problem at another station on the way to DC. Had to call Bikeshare office because the screens at the stations are small, and scratched up , very difficult to read. But Bikeshare gave me a code to switch to another bike. After having a wonderful time touring DC we ended our day on the river in Georgetown area and put the bikes into a station there. Had a great day. But days later when we got our charges for the bike rental which was to be $8 for a day rental, my charge was $38 and they were charged $40. I called the Bikesare billing office and was told that I needed to return the bike to a station every 30 minutes in order to be charged $8 for the day. This was not clear to us when we rented the bikes. The web page is very deceiving about touring for a day. I was told bu the office that these bikes are for commuters not touring. I think this was a very deceitful business practice meant to gouge tourist. I will not use the bike service again and do not recommend it."
Gabriella P,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",5,08/28/2017,Awesome way to see the city in one day,"I'm surprised with all of the bad reviews on here, the bike share is really not that hard if you follow directions. You sign up at a station using a credit card. You will use same credit card throughout the day to receive a code to unlock your bikes. The most you can link to one card will be two bikes. So if you have a family of 4, you will need two cards. Not a big deal, but can be inconvenient. We did the 24 hour pass for 8 bucks each. Basically, you unlock your bike and you have 30 min to drop off at another bike station. You can literally just drop it off, swipe for another code and check it back out. I don't see why you would wanna keep it out for more since you stop at a museum or memorial and walk around, who would wanna walk around with their bike? The stations are located all over the memorials and cities. I downloaded the app and could click on a station to see if there was docking available and or bikes, and this also gives you a way to plan out your day to see everything. The app is updated in real time. If you happen to get to a station with no docks available, you can request a grace period to find another station. Also when you check your bike in, just make sure the light turns green to know you checked it in correctly. They will also send you a text message. I absolutely loved it, there's no way we would have been able to see all the sights at the mall without this. We didnt miss our 30 min deadline once, so all day it was just $16 for both of us! If i had to do it again, I would have chose to go on a weekday for less crowds, easier to ride. "
scuba840,"Tucson, Arizona",1,08/25/2017,SCAM SCAM STAY AWAY FROM CAPITAL BIKESHARE ,"Even though you purchase a multi hour rental,  you still get hit with very high hidden fees.  What makes these fees hidden?  They are not prominently disclosed at the time of rental...  You should avoid Capital Bikeshare like the plague.  I feel defrauded."
MaKu70,"Munich, Germany",5,08/25/2017,The best way to experience Washington DC.,"What a great way to get around in DC!I spent 4 days in the city and used the bikes every day. Signup is done in a minute or two and you are on the way. You have unlimited 30 minute rides. That seemed to be not so easy to understand for some but was pretty convenient. If you need a bike longer than 30 minutes, just set a timer and ""return"" it to the nearest station after 25 minutes and rent it again right away. After the initial signup, renting is just a swipe of your credit card, pretty fast. I had some stations where the touchscreen or the credit card reader wouldn't accept the card right away but in the end it always worked.Make sure you install the Spotcycle app! It helps you with finding bikes and stations."
disneybonvoyage,"barto, pa",3,08/21/2017,Mixed Experience!,"I did a bit of research before renting these bikes, so I was aware of the 30 minute time limit. * Get the app- This will tell you the location of the bikes and how many are available at that station.* Enter a cell phone # so you get a text about the rental.I was not aware of the 2 bike per credit card limit. If you need more than 2 bikes, have another credit card on you.This was a great way to move from the top of the mall to the bottom quickly.The problem came when we returned the bikes. All 3 bikes received a green light to indicate the bike was properly docked. I also received (2) texts. Here is where I messed up. I though that meant the (2) RECEIPTS were successful. However, it actually was each bike, meaning (1) of the bikes was not successfully docked even thought we got a green light. About 30 minutes later I received a text that we were being charged additional fees for being over the 30 minutes. I called and spoke with a gentleman who asked if we were near the bikes. We were not. He said he would send someone to dock the bike. He was very pleasant. This put a damper on our time as we knew ""I Agree"" to the $1200.00 cost of the bike if anything were to happen to it. It was quite the bummer on our trip. About 45 minutes later we received a text that the bike was successfully docked. OMG was I so relieved. The cost of the bikes should have been $6.00 for 3 bikes, but I was charged $2.00 on the one credit card and $4.00 TWICE on the other credit card. Seems others have been overcharged much more so I did not call to dispute the charge. Although it does seem like they make their money by overcharges.The charges do seem confusing on the website and from other reviewers as you can take the bikes out for longer time periods, but it is a small extra charge per 1/2 hour. (makes sense) I just dont see how it adds up to such a large bill as other posters mention. I would do this again, but I would be very cautious in making sure everything has been returned properly and make sure of the charges to my credit card."
TheDomss,France,5,08/09/2017,Excellent to discover Washington,"Excellent way to discover the city.We took a one day pass and as we liked it a lot a 3 days pass.The city is so huge than you can quickly move to the next place.For us the best way was to switch between biking and walk.For those who wants only bike for hours without stopping, it is perhaps better to rent bikes.

YarivI,"Rehovot, Israel",4,08/09/2017,Very good way to see everything and fast but not in a car,"There is no much to say about riding a bike but few points.1) This is a great way to explore the city.2) Know that not everywhere you can reach and sometimes you have to leave them behind with all it means, someone has to watch or take a risk.3) With every CC you may rent only 2 bikes. And every card has to make a membership for 7$ a bike, this sucks a bit.This not include the rent time.4) Be careful and when there is rain you waste your rent time, this sucks as well."
Liane T,,4,08/08/2017,"Ideal for frequent, short trips","DC is a great city to see by bike, and capital bikeshare makes that more convenient. I like that I can take a short trip by bike, and once I dock I don't have to worry about it anymore. If I want to take the train or an Uber to my next stop, no problem! However, I'm using this as a local taking short trips. I could see this being a quick way for tourists to shuttle between museums and monuments, but it is NOT an economical option if you want to be physically riding bikes for more than an hour or so at a time. That said, while it's unfortunate that many reviewers were surprised by the charges they incurred, capital bikeshare is certainly not a scam; their pricing structure is very clearly laid out on the kiosk where you rent them. To me the biggest downside is that the bikes can sometimes feel clunky and heavy."
Molikorp,"Santiago, Chile",5,07/30/2017,The best way to know Washington,"For just 8 dollars, you can get access to bike rides all around Washington. I spent 3 days there and without this bike rental system my experience would be completely different.

cgmd76,"Arlington, Virginia",1,07/22/2017,Capital Bikeshare is BANKING on novice users to make a docking mistake so they can profit.,"I rented two bikes for my daughter and myself at Wilson and 31st in Arlington on July 21. We literally had the bikes for 10 minutes -- just enough time to ride to the bottom of the hill and dock them at Arlington Mill Road -- less than a mile away. This was only my second time renting from Capital Bikeshare and I didn't re-dock the bikes properly. I happened to check my bank account on July 22 about midday and noticed a charge of $62 in addition to the $4.00 rental charge from Capital Bikeshare. I called and spoke with two different representatives who explained that one bike was returned five hours later to a station on Four Mile Run and the other had not yet been returned and was still accusing charges. Maurice said they could authorize a one-time courtesy reimbursement of half of the charges -- which could not be finalized until the other bike was returned. I drove down two the Arlington Mill station and located the bike that was parked but not properly docked. I locked it into place and called back to speak with a supervisor. After calling back several hours later, I was told a supervisor would contact me at 11 pm. Irene did call me but said exactly the same. It was my fault for not docking the bike properly, the instructions are clearly printed on the kiosk, and she could only authorize half of the charges refunded. I said I found that outrageous as an annual pass costs less that my total charges -- which amounted to $157.00. I could have purchased a day pass, a three-day pass, or an annual pass for less. I asked to speak with someone above her and was told there was no one. I called back later and asked another representative, Cynthia, for the name of Irene's supervisor. She said Ashley and Irene are the only two supervisors; there is no one above them. I find it extraordinary that a business can blindly rob people, legally. Capital Bike Share is BANKING on novice users to make a docking mistake so they can profit. If they cared about the customer, they would notify customers via text when their time is near expiring -- that would be GOOD business. I never received any notification that the bikes had not been docked properly -- even though that is a question addressed on their FAQ page. If I hadn't checked my back account, that bike would still be accruing charges. I am just asking for a little kindness and compassion. I understand that I made an unfortunate mistake, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Give me an annual pass OR reduce the rate to $25, and IMPLEMENT A NOTIFICATION SYSTEM to customers! I will make sure every online reviewer hears this story and I will never rent from a this company again -- absolutely no humanity!"
carloatx,"Austin, Texas",5,07/21/2017,"This is the way to see the National Mall, BUT YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO USE IT!!","For $8 you can get a 24 hour pass to rent a bike. You must return and dock the bike within 30 minutes though or you will get overcharged! Download the spotcycle app and it will show you where the bike docks are in your area and how many bikes there are in real time. It really helps and I had no problems. When docking your bike, make sure the light turns green which locks the bike. Some docks aren't working properly so make sure the light turns green. When getting another bike out, you will use your credit card to get a new code. They will not charge your card again. It just gets you a new code to get the bike out again. If you do this correctly, you will be able to see the entire National Mall and all memorials in one day! BUT REMEMBER TO RE-DOCK YOUR BIKE EVERY 30 MINUTES!!!!"

You must re-dock your bike EVERY 30 MINUTES to avoid overage charges. Impossible in most cases. the sign should clearly spell out the cost of using these bikes. they should not be used by anybody who wants to bike for more than 30 minutes in total. They apply creative billing once you are done and the line-by-line charges are not predictable at all based on what is posted at the racks. If you are sight-seeing, find a different way to get around. It would have been cheaper to bring our own bikes with us on the plane!"
JanMadmanD,"Prague, Czech Republic",3,07/19/2017,Can be very expensive if you dont know how to use it:),"Always remember - you have to dock the bike every 30 minutes. Doesnt matter what kind of plan did you buy! allways check if your bike was docked properly!! Otherwise you got in trouble. Especially if you are a tourist. But otherwise it could be a very confy transport in WDC. (so to be honest, one day cost me once about 50usd and once I had to go by cab 10miles to dock my bike properly again :-D)"
Vonschmidt,"Houston, Texas",4,07/11/2017,Great experience ,I read the details of the charge system up front and its relatively clear 8 dollars for a 24 hour access pass which then allows you to ride the bike. Beyond this there are multiple levels if charges 1-29 min it's free after membership. Dock the Bike and get another right away. However if you go thirty min up to hefty nice then it's two dollars. Same procedure dock and recent the clock stops ticking. Go over the hour and it get expensive nine dollars for sixty to minty minutes. Beyond this it's stupid expensive like seven hours for ninety eight dollars. So the trick is dock it every thirty min. Other than that good bikes great trails best way to see the parks. Dock often 
Kristine O,,1,07/07/2017,TOTAL SCAM! BEWARE. DECEPTIVE COMPANY,"We live in DC. My son's bike was broken, so I suggested Capital Bikeshare for the afternoon. The $8, 24 hour rental turned into $78!!! I called @bikeshare to find out what happened and they told me that you have to DOCK THE BIKE EVERY 30 MINUTES!!!! How unrealistic and ridiculous. Don't use them. You will be ripped off."
pradeeppeddineni,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",1,07/07/2017,RIP OFF SCAM!!,"It's a rip off scam, be aware of 8$day passes. These are not unlimited for a day(24hrs), u have to dock the bike for every 30mins, and get it extended. or else you'll end up paying hefty bills to cc. Try talking to customer service u might have chance of 50% refund."
CathyR1886,,2,07/04/2017,Check you bank account...,"I will say, after being in DC this past weekend and renting 2 bikes, I would never tour another city any other way. This was a great experience... until I got home and checked my bank account. I rented 2 bikes at $8 each and we went over our 30 min by just a few minutes, twice. I should have been charged an additional $8 total for those few minutes, which I knew I would be. I was charged $98 and when I called they said it was because I didn't dock one of my bikes correctly the night before. This also explains why I couldn't get my bike on Saturday. I had to use a different credit card to get my 2nd bike and spend another $8 for a new 24 hour rental. I made sure both bikes were docked correctly according to the lights that blink. I'm being refunded $92, but no apologies or accountability for a flawed system, at best."
Andrés G,,1,07/03/2017,Be Careful - Poor Information ,"I rented 4 bikes for 2 hours 57 minutes last week and they changed U$128 to my credit cards. Their explanation was:""You purchased a single ride pass which cost $2.00 each. The single ride pass includes one ride of 30 minutes or less, when you have a trip duration over 30 minutes then you incur usage fees. The usage fees are calculated base on the duration of the trip. Your trip duration is 2 hours and 57 minutes incurring usage fees of $30.00.each bike""Unacceptable, expensive experience!!"
William S,"Traverse City, Michigan",1,07/03/2017,Scam,"This company is a scam. The ""all day pass"" is extremely misleading. It is not truly all day, it is all day 30 minutes intervals of docking, so if you go over 30 minutes without docking, you get charged. So you cannot ride anywhere for longer than 30 minutes, and you cannot ride anywhere that doesn't have docking station, but sure, let's call it an all day pass, that couldn't possibly mislead anybody. I got hit with a $62 charge on top of the $8 ""all day pass"" charge. Really? They also will not refund you the full amount when you call and explain what happened.Don't waste your money, rent from a real bike shop. I could of bought a bike for the price they charged me."
dacastevens,"Charlotte, North Carolina",1,07/01/2017,Rip Off,"You think the bike costs $8/day to rent - NOT!  Beware if you don't dock the bike every 30 minutes they charge huge fees!  $94 for us for one bike!
Customer service said these are only for commuting, not hourly rental!
Complete Rip Off!"
Richard C,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",1,06/25/2017,Great Service ruined by absolute rip off charges - BE VERY AWARE OF THE SMALL PRINT!!,Used this service in other major cities including London and NY - used it in DC to show some visitors around the main DC monuments. Its very misleading when you take out the 24hr pass for - what you think - is $8 per person. Only later did I notice that they had charged me an additional $76 for riding around the capital for 3hrs!! Got a very sarcastic woman at the help line explaining to me that its clearly stated on the receipt paper from the machine (NO ITS NOT!) that there would be extra charges for more than 30 minutes usage at a time. It wracks up to $8 per 30 minutes after the first 90 minutes - complete rip off!!!
EmagW,"Baltimore, Maryland",1,06/18/2017,Awesome Ride Awful Upcharge due to Unclear Procedure,"My friends and I loved riding these bikes around DC. We were in from out of town and enjoyed getting the exercise and the adventure of finding the bikes at the different docks and heading down from Adams Morgan to the mall. We happily and smugly rode around the enormous mall and covered so much more territory than we ever could have on foot. We stopped and ate at a fun restaurant, parked (not docked) our bikes and fully enjoyed our day... until ...the next day my friend checked her credit card and we got the sticker shock. Two bikes -- $108 for 4 hours of riding! And we signed up for $8 (x2=$16) for 24 hours. What the heck? WE HAD NO IDEA THAT WE HAD TO DOCK THE BIKES EVERY 30 MINUTES AND TAKE THEM OUT AGAIN IN ORDER TO KEEP THE CHARGE AT $8. Had we read Tripadvisor's bad reviews we would have known. Too many people have had this happen to them. Bikeshare refunded half, and their customer service was able to explain clearly on the phone that this is the procedure, but nowhere in the written verbiage does it indicate this odd procedure. The procedure makes sense if one thinks about the bikeshare being a commuter service first, but tourists need better information about this funny check-in, check-out thing. I had checked out the website to see how it worked beforehand, and $8 for 24 hours seemed simple enough. The grid of pricing shows upcharges for time ranges, but the overriding message was $8 for 24 hours and so the upcharges felt like they belonged to a different category. I am disappointed that such a great idea and well executed system cannot simply add this language to their website or FAQs. I have no doubt that tourists like me might have chosen to pay some upcharge for the convenience of having them out for longer, OR we would have enjoyed the challenge of finding docks every 30 minutes like a treasure hunt. I would guess that the 25% of 1 star reviews (at this writing) would be 4's or 5's if they would fix this problem of understanding. AND I think Bikeshare would earn their upcharges with knowing consumers rather than getting the upcharges from consumers who end up feeling deceived. Just so unnecessary. PLEASE note the procedure and the upcharges if you go past 30 minutes without docking, and THEN have a great ride!"
Loperotti,"Mogi das Cruzes, SP",4,06/17/2017,The best choice,"I loved rent this bikes on Washington, is easy to rent and I think is the best way to go to the attractions but sometimes you have a problem to left the bike in some points because they was totally full of bikes and you need to find another place near of the attraction to left your bike. "
Jayre,"The Woodlands, Texas",5,06/11/2017,The BEST way to see D.C.,"What a great idea!! We chose to forgo entering any museums on this trip, deciding to simply explore all the monuments. We started at the Supreme Court and made our way down the National Mall all the way to Arlington Cemetery. After then looping around the Tidal Basin we made our way to Georgetown where we returned our bikes. It was a full day adventure, and at our pace. It was remarkable!!! I will admit to being shocked about the final cost ($120 for the two bikes for 6 hours of rental). That part seemed rather deceptive in light of the ""24 hour membership."" But, considering all we saw and did it was worth it."
GCandcrew,Edmonton,1,06/07/2017,Unethical company,"Renting bikes to sight see is always a good idea, which we (2 adults) did for an evening, paying Cn22.31 for 24 hr ""membership"". We spent 3 hours with the bike, and later, back home we had the very unpleasant charge of an extra Cn$116.30. Thought there was a scam, somebody cloned our card, etc and called the company. We were then informed that you need to park the bike every 30 min and take it out again not to incur extra charges. And those charges get progressively bigger...and where were those stations where you were supposed to ""check your bike in out"" placed? Are we all supposed to ride for only 30 mins and look for those bloody bike stations rather than enjoying the scenery, monuments, etc...? Most people won't do that or go over time by the time they could find such things. Designed to be a perfect scheme to rip people off, who, like us, thought, as in many countries we have visited, we could keep the bike for a determined amount of time for a fixed charge. I noticed as i was posting that I was not the only one that felt to that sad scheme. Taking advantage of people who actually prefer to rent a bike to see the city being ecologically friendly. I suggest look elsewhere, there should be more ethical business of the type around"
Lori H,,5,06/05/2017,Only way to see the city ,This is the only way to see the city if you have limited time. The bikes are easy to rent and multiple locations to pick up and drop off bikes....I would suggest downloading the app for ease of use. The city is very bike friendly.....there are bike lanes as well as ramps on sidewalks. The way this works is you pay a membership fee either for 24 hours ($8) or you can do 3 days ($17) then you pay each time you use the bike. If your ride is less than 30 minutes it is free so the best thing to do is have a plan and once you enter your code to get your bike ride there and drop the bike at the nearest station. Once you set up your initial account then it reads off of your credit card and it is much quicker to get bikes. Make sure when you drop your bike the light is green and the bike is secure before you walk away. 
stephanie s,,1,06/02/2017,Scam! Don't use!,"I would not recommend using their services for bike rental in D.C. First of all they'll trick you by saying you can rent bikes for 24 hours for only $8 and later when you check you're credit card you incurred more charges from them cause it doesn't tell you that if you have it out longer than 30 minutes you will be charged extra. Then when you do try to return the bike near your destination good luck finding an open spot, you'll have to ride an extra 10 minutes past your destination to find another docking point and then walk back to your destination. Save your money and your time and go with someone else. "
AngM6,"Atlanta, Georgia",5,06/01/2017,They're everywhere! So easy and cheap! Use the app to find them,We rented two bikes for one day and used them all over town to visit the monuments and museums. Saved our feet from a LOT of walking. Very easy to use (I recommend downloading the app to see how many bikes available and where they are located). D.C. is a very bike friendly city and I would highly recommend this cheap way to get around town to everyone.
Rose-Anne M,"Sydney, Australia",5,05/26/2017,Excellent customer service,"After having a terrific experience on the bikes, I had an equally terrific experience with the customer service team. I accidentally failed to dock my bike properly, resulting in a very big penalty fee. When I explained the situation to the customer service team, they were flexible enough to split the difference with me, refunding me half the penalty even though it was really my fault. There was no arguing about it, they were pleasant and made the decision quickly. Awesome activity, awesome staff."
449warrene,"Windham, Maine",5,05/24/2017,Fun way to see the sights,"What a great way to move around in the touristy areas of DC. The prices are reasonable, the system (once you run through once or twice) is easy to use. Once when we were returning the bikes one didn't lock properly. We called in for customer service and were treated very nicely by a real person. Not only did she help us get the bike accounted for, she helped us understand how the payment system works. The hint is, ""return your bike every 30 minutes to avoid extra fees."""
Charlestonmike,"Charleston, South Carolina",5,05/19/2017,Best way to see DC,Loved the option of utilizing the bikeshare. Understand the system before undertaking. A payment of $2 gives you 30 minutes with the bike to then be returned at any of their bike stations (there is a good phone app that helps track the bike stations and availability of bikes and return slots). If you go beyond 30 minutes you will then be charged extra fees. This applies even if you purchase the 24 hour pass. To stay within the fixed rate and keep from additional fees you must return the bike within 30 mins. All in all it is a much better alternative than taking a cap from one monument to another. Highly recommended if you do not want to walk.
Oktravels56,Oklahoma,3,05/17/2017,The Good and a few cautionary tales,"The good:We really enjoyed riding the bikes down the Mall to the Washington Monument. The bikes were solid and easy to ride. (Even for short people.) Saved a lot of time and was a fun way to end the first day. The cautionary tales:1) We needed 2 bikes and there were 2 in the rack. However, one had a red light, which we found out meant it was out of order. So, we had to walk one bike to a second station to rent the 2nd bike.2) read the review thread about checking your bikes into the docking station every 30 min. This didn't happen to us, but it easily could have since we used them just under 30 min and we didn't know about that rule.3) Take a video of yourself docking the bikes in. We followed the instructions and our station had the correct sounds & lights, plus the bike was securely docked. (we tried to pull each out). HOWEVER, the docking station must not have been working because after we left, someone took one bike out and kept it for 12 hours. We were charged $97.Fortunately after 5-6 calls they refunded the money (1/2 at first, then the other 1/2).We had lots of documentation of our whereabouts due to google tracking, etc. but could have used a video of us docking the bikes. Might have made the refund process easier."
Sally S,"Hackensack, Minnesota",1,05/12/2017,CONFUSING,"The bike share concept is a good one. The devil is in the details. As two day tourists, we were taken by the system--had to pay 200.00 because we didn't ""dock our bikes"" every 30 minutes. SHEEZ, we would have had to spend all of our 30 minutes looking for docking stations instead of biking to our destinations. We read and re-read the confusing directions before swiping our credit card. Membership fees, minutes.....+ this + that...WHAT?? Taxation without Representation...DC has figured out a way to get more of my hard earned money."
Alana E,,1,05/05/2017,Deceptive Pricing,Like most other reviewers on here I was unaware that there were any usage fees for over 30 minutes even when you purchase a day pass. It is not clearly advertised at stations that these fees exist. We paid $16 for 2 day passes and were charged an additional $44 in fees. This should be clearly advertised at all bike stations. It's not really worth it to have to go find a bike dock every 30 minutes because you'll probably spend half the time looking for the nearest station/figuring out how to dock the bike/accessing a new code.
Tessa K,,5,05/03/2017,Great way to get around,"Parked on almost any corner, you'll find the bikeshare bikes. These are a great way to discover the city. Do keep in mind that the costs go up after 30 minutes - these first minutes are practically free. Use the bikeshare app to find the nearest spot for a bike or for a parking place once you're done. Recommended: cycle down the Mall towards Lincoln Memorial at night."
VermonteronVacation,Vermont,5,05/01/2017,"Biking around Washington, DC","We loved biking around DC. The BikeShare bikes are easy to use. It's a fun and inexpensive way to get around and get exercise at the same time. As long as you keep your trips to 1/2 - 1 hours each, it's very affordable. A 24 hr pass for $8 lets you take as many 30 minute or less trips as you want. Tips: use the locator on the kiosk to jot down locations of nearby docking stations, so you don't find yourself running over the 30 minute limit because you can't find where to drop the bike off. Each kiosk will tell you 8 nearby locations."
Shifansadeek,"Kandy, Sri Lanka",5,04/27/2017,Very Usefull,"Capital bikeshare has been very useful for me in capital. First day i was walking through the city couldn't cover much places. Second day i came across the bike share and its been very useful. Most of the stands are near the attraction place. And easy to drive on the road, bikes are in excellent conditions "
Rebel1021,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5,04/25/2017,Awesome!,"So, I see the other reviews of the people who did not read the pricing completely and I get that it is not super clear. However, I rented 2 bikes for $8 each and road them all over D.C. for the 24 hours and never incurred extra charges. We had a blast visiting all the monuments and museums via bikes. We turned it into a fun game to find the next bikeshare station in the 30 minutes. Use the bikes and dock them every 30 minutes, and they will be an amazing way to see Washington on your next trip! "
DAD11,Toronto,4,04/22/2017,D.C. Perfect city for biking,This is the best way to see D.C. A number of roads have bike lanes. Bikes are good quality. Here is a tip - don't just take a bike and leave.Should have read locations as didn't find the website helpfuwhile trying to read on my phone. 
Neolithe,"Lynchburg, Virginia",1,04/22/2017,Beware,"As others have said...Capital Bikeshare is very deceptive in the communication of pricing. I needed 13 bikes for a school trip, I used several cards to get bikes for everyone. We used the bikes for a little under 4 hours and was charged $100 including the rental for 2 BIKES! Called and was refunded 50% on each card. Even though I explained that I called and talked to a representative prior to purchase and was never informed of needing to dock the bikes every 30 minutes."
Abigail G,"Jackson, Michigan",1,04/20/2017,Consumers Beware,"My boyfriend and I decided to rent bikes through ""Capital Bikeshare,"" as we saw it as a great way to get around to all the monuments in a decent amount of time and it was. That said, the pricing of the bike rental timeframes is totally misleading!! For example, we decided to do the 24hr pass for $8 each, even though we knew we wouldn't keep the bikes for that long. That said, 24hrs for $8; can't beat it, right?! Well, that is definitely not the case and judging from the numerous negative reviews read since receiving an additional $76 charge two days post-docking our bikes for good, we are not the only wrongly informed consumers who have been charged outrageous prices unknowingly. After seeing the additional $76 dollar charge, I typed an email to ""Capital Bikeshare"" inquiring (I will update this review when I hear back) about the charge. I also looked through all of their ""FAQ's"" and ""Help"" portions of their website; however, nothing touched upon this topic. I was extremely concerned, so I went to the ever trusting ""tripadvisor"" for help and learned that Capital Bikeshare does not have a great reputation with consumers and their misleading prices have affected many travelers pocketbooks! ""Capital Bikeshare"" really needs to be upfront and honest regarding their costs and additional charges, and even if these extra charges are listed in the fine print (I have not read this yet), my personal opinion is that they need to make it more visible /noticeable at each docking station, as I have gathered that most often ""Capital Bikeshare"" is a spur of the moment type of purchase; it was for us anyway, and the only rates we noticed were the very low-cost prices front and center and no warning of extreme additional charges. Through my readings on tripadvisor, I noticed that one reviewer stated when she called Capital Bikeshare, they told her that the $8 pass is for 24hrs, but it only covers the first 30 minutes. If you do not want to be charged, you must check in every 30 minutes at a docking station. This to me is complete trickery of Capital Bikeshare. It also creates an inconvenience for the customer, as there are very few docking stations around and I didn't notice a single one near the memorial district, which is largely the area traveled with the bikes. All in all, I will NEVER use Capital Bikeshare again; they are a rip off company!"
Elizabethott,"Conshohocken, Pennsylvania",1,04/18/2017,Beware!,"They false advertise a 24hr pass for $8. After paying that, you must redock the bike every 30 minutes so you do not incur additional charges. After keeping our bikes for 4 hours I owed over $60. Advertisement is not readily available. Even on their website it doesn't call out the true cost until the very bottom. I would just be very aware of what you are getting yourself into. "
jayyen93,"Dublin, Ireland",5,04/17/2017,"Easy way to get around the city, especially in the Mall","Metro can be unreliable and its stations too sparse sometimes. Traffic is too horrible for car or rideshare especially near the Mall. Walking is sometimes not a realistic option between two points.The perfect solution? Biking! But not everyone especially visitors has a bike, so Capital Bikeshare solves that problem!This bike-sharing program is seriously the best innovation I've seen in DC! Years ago when I first got to DC, getting around was a hassle, but with Capital Bikeshare, I could explore more on bike during my 2nd time back in DC. With so many bike docks throughout the city, it's usually not a problem finding an available bike unless you are around super-popular point like Lincoln Memorial.If you have at least a day pass, you can use the bike as many times as you want without extra charge as long as you ride for less than 30 minutes each time. Just make sure if you dock your bike properly (wait for the light to turn green) after you're done or else you'll be charged after 30 minutes! Use the Metro or rideshare to cover the extreme distances, but if you are traversing medium to short distance especially throughout the National Mall, I highly recommend using Capital Bikeshare!"
Kristina S,California,4,04/17/2017,"Excellent way to get around the city, a bit confusing at first. Inexpensive.","These bikes were everywhere and it was a great way to get around as the monuments are very far apart. It is a bit confusing at first...you rent with a credit card and there is a charge for being a ""member"" $8. Then, I think, $2 per 1/2 hour. The charges were a bit confusing. They only allow you to rent 2 bikes at a time and we needed 3 and put them on 2 different cards. They do hold an amount on your credit card (about $100-$150 for each bike). You can return them to any station throughout the city, however, there needs to be an empty space to put it in. This might be difficult sometimes. They don't provide helmets. In the city, you have to ride on the street and there are no bike lanes (not ideal for kids). When you are on the National Mall, you can ride on the paths, however, there are a lot of people and other bikes. Good experience and would do it again."
zocoma,"Dahlonega, Georgia",5,04/15/2017,Great way to see DC ,"My son and I used bikeshare for a day on the mall. I had visited the website before renting the bikes and the policy of checking the bikes in every 30 minutes was clearly stated. The reviews by people claiming this is a scam demonstrate how many people don't read. There are docks all over the place and the website shows where bikes and docking spaces are available. We actually had an easier time finding bikes than free spaces. Even though we went over time on one segment, it was only an extra 4 dollars and the convenience and fun of the bikes was well worth the $20 we spent. I recommend checking the bikes in and out at every available dock to reset the timer and avoid extra charges. We will definitely do this again on our next visit to DC. "
Cynda R,"San Antonio, Texas",5,04/13/2017,First time,"I've never tried bikeshare before but i will definitely use it again. I was visiting DC and had a couple hours to get to the National Mall and to the Vietnam Memorial Wall. We rented bikes with my credit card and away we went. There was also a bike station in front of our hotel. I was really nervous because I'm 4'10"" and my sweetheart is 6' tall. We were both able to adjust the bikes to fit. There was a carrier on the front for my backpack, a bell and three speeds on the bike. The biggest hazards were all of the other people. I'm glad i tried it! "
groverbark,"Paris, France",2,04/10/2017,Works most of the time but when it doesn't it can cost you lots of aggravation,"I have a yearly membership. Lots of the policies are silly. Like 30 minutes before you have to return the bike, when NYC is 45 minutes. Most of the time this service works efficiently but increasingly bike stations will not have any bikes available and anywhere from one to three bikes that need repair. Alternatively you will try to return a bike to a station with multiple slots free, but there is a glitch in the system. I get the impression that no one is driving the train. Are any progressive city politicians paying attention to this. Get some better management."
DMVTERP12,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",1,03/27/2017,SCAM,"SCAM ALERT!! READ THE FINE PRINT, BE CAREFUL. I do not support this company.I do not support this company based on principal of their shady business practices.I do not have enough bad things to say about this company, their people, and their practices...I first rented a bike to take to the grocery store and the touch screens were broken and it was a very poor experience attempting to get a bike rental, given the screen didn't work well. I can only assume based on this experience that maybe they don't upkeep the equipment well enough. Okay, so bad first impression, but once i finally got a bike, it obviously worked fine as a bike should. No flats, no issues, no problems.The second time I rented a bike, it was for a ""24 hour"" period of time, quoted at ""$8"" for the entire period. Now comes the fun part... a few days later i was charged an additional $94!!Apparently, you are supposed to dock the bike every 30 minutes or else you will be charged outrageous amounts for the time (that you supposedly already paid for). This is not disclosed in an obvious location or anywhere in the prompting on the tiny screen in front of you. This is only noted in the extremely long and arduous to read ""Terms & Conditions"" (which by the way is about 156 pages or so, and would take hours to read on the tiny screen provided for you)I immediately called Capital Bikeshare to dispute this charge and see if they would give me a one time waive, considering I did not damage the bike and followed what I had believed were the appropriate procedures. I spoke with 1 lady, Lawanda, who was a smart-alec and not helpful... She was only offering a 50% reduction of my fee and was trying to help get management (UNACCEPTABLE). Unfortunately I had to hang-up for another call coming in. I then had to call back and spoke with Brandy, who could not get her phone off of speaker or was having some kind of feedback loop issue with the audio. That may not have been her fault, but regardless, not helping my frustrations. At this point I am incredibly fed up and disgusted with this company. I have read other reviews online dealing with similar situations I had only realized after the fact."
Skimo11,"Ray twp, michigan",4,03/20/2017,A great addition to your visit to DC,This is a great little company that will help you get the most out of your visit to Washington DC. It takes a little bit to figure out how it works but once you get it it's a great addition to traveling from one area to another. We give this company the credit for us being able to accomplish as much as we did. Some of the bikes are in need of repair and it is your responsibility to let them know but it gets to be that there are so many that you give up .If you decide to do this be sure to download the app Spotcycle that will allow you to know how many bikes are getting one location and locations that have a spot for you to return the bike. It was a great addition to a beautiful day. 
Martin N,"Beaconsfield, Canada",3,03/11/2017,Great with Caveats,"Amazing time riding the bike with family around the Washington Mall. Best way to tour the area. Caveat #1: Prepare to have someone stay with the bikes as the rest of the group goes to visit monuments (e.g. Lincoln Memorial). Caveat #2: We had great difficulty finding empty spaces to return the bikes, had to go back and forth between sites looking for spaces which resulted in separating the family and wasting an hour of our precious visiting time. Capital Bikeshares will provide you a free extension at their kiosk if no spaces but sitll rom for improvement."
Rick H,,1,02/21/2017,"used the bike for 4 hours on Saturday morning Feb. 18, 2017","It is a bait and switch scheme. Just beware of how the game is played. I used the bike for about 4 hours for what they said would be an $8 charge starting around 8:00 am. Supposedly you can use it for 24 hours BUT they don't tell you, and I did not realize until I returned home and saw additional charges, that unless you check it in every 30 minutes you will actually be charged $46. If I had checked it in every 30 minutes I would have been charged only the $8.00! No information or guidelines were provided that this is how the game is played. JUST BEWARE ! IT IS RATHER DISAPPOINTING THAT THEY WOULD DO THIS, especially on a quiet Saturday morning when no commuters were using the bikes."
902markf,Miami,1,12/21/2016,Beware of the fine print !,"Close to a scam ! Yes, indeed, a 24-hour membership still forces you into the 30 minutes periods of actual usage time and then you have to find a free slot at your destination. Nothing of that is being explained upfront, instead their web page suggests that with the 24-hour membership you can actually use your bike freely for one day. Upon calling the customer service their reaction made me feel that they actually count on tourists falling into that trap."
Alyssa L,,5,12/05/2016,Really great way to get around DC!,"We used Capital Bikeshare for one day on a recent trip to DC. The first day we walked around DC and by the end of it we were exhausted. The second day we got bikes first thing in the morning and used them all day! The way it works is you pay $8/per person for 24 hours of access. If you keep your rides under 30 min (not hard, there are loads of stations to trade your bikes out at/you'll want to go inside places and see things!) then the rides are free. If you go over 30 minutes, you have to pay additional charges (not much, I think they said it would be $1.50 for a 90 minute ride). I highly recommend this to tourists, you will thank yourself for saving your feet from walking and saving your bank account from getting taxis/ubers everywhere. "
Mauka-96797,,5,12/02/2016,Highly recommend,"My teenaged sons, husband and I enjoyed riding bikes all 4 days we were in DC. There was a dock two blocks from our hotel and there were docks near everywhere we wanted to go. You just have to be mindful of the time and park or check in and out at the next dock within the 30 minutes so that you don't incur additional fees. DC drivers seemed used to sharing the road with bikes as many locals have bikes too. We rode on both sides of the National Mall (our hotel was on the Air & Space side but we rode as far as the White House side) and around the museums and monuments and Capitol Hill. We even took the subway to the station near the Marine Memorial, walked a block to a dock, got bikes and rode 1 mile to the memorial and docked a block from there. Parked there and after spending some time there we checked bikes out again and rode back down to a dock and walked to the Metro station. So easy and fun!"
Vikram D,,1,12/02/2016,read the fine Print,"They charged me $80 for a single day bike - where i docked the bike within 30 mins every time. Upon talking to them they said the bikes dock sensors did not show it was docked - even though they agreed the bike was at the station.Typical customer service - they started telling me about the ""Terms and Conditions"" that i agreed to as a part of signing up for the service. They gave me a lesson on how we should read the fine print in all the services that we take up."
Jane C,"Norfolk, Virginia",1,11/16/2016,Poor quality,"Docks sometimes don't work so the bike cannot be checked in at the end of a ride, so the user is charged until Bikeshare fixes the dock. Horrible quality."
Gerald C,Texas,5,11/15/2016,A great way to see the monuments!,"We are new to the Bikeshare system. However, after spending a day on the bikes we loved it. The app tells you the locations of the bike racks along with how many stations there are and the current number of bikes at the location. The cost for a bike for 24 hours was $8. This is hinged on you docking your bike at a bike station every 30 minutes. If you accomplish this there will be no additional fees on your credit card. However, if you do what my son-in-law did earlier in the week and not dock the bike the cost adds up fast. There are plenty of bike stations and bikes to get almost anywhere you want to go around the Mall.Also, we took 5 bikes out each time (2 per credit card) and the maintenance was excellent. If there is a problem with the bike you choose you just put it back in the rack and press the maintenance button and someone will fix the deficiency quickly.It was a great day."

Kymsilverfox,"Gundaroo, Australia",5,10/21/2016,A fantastic way to move around DC,"I was in DC for over a week for business visiting from Australia. A 3 day pass is $US17, then the registered credit card is used each outing to obtain pass code to pull a bike from the rack. You are billed for time used - which is very cheap. Less tha 30 min is free, so I would ride from hotel to metro, and park bike at nearest bike rack so it was free use. I did a big ride from crystal city to Georgetown along the Potomac which was great. when I reached the destination parked the bike, walked around for 2 hrs, then found another bike rack, picked another bike then onto mall. There are bike stations everywhere so you are not left holding a bike while you go for a wander, if you do it right you will only pay the 3 day fee"
923mindya,"Orange Park, Florida",1,10/21/2016,Don't rent these bikes,"Seems like a great idea, but when you go to pay for a bike it tells you it is $8 for the day but does not tell you how much it charges you for every 30 minutes you have the bikes out. My family and I rented three of them and used them for the day to go to the monuments, the capital and even to dinner (we actually went inside and got ready thinking we paid for the day). I received a charge for $282 for one day of bike rentals. I called customer service and they said there is nothing they can do about it. We could have rented much better mountain bikes for $40/day."
rob30berg2015,"Oosterhout, The Netherlands",3,10/11/2016,nice way to move around however app could be better,we used the bikes to move around in Washington mall area and near Rock Creek park.If you stay under the 30 min they are free. However it is not very clear sighted were you can find the next bike station and if there is still room. So be aware were you are going and if there is a station nearby.
gordofong,"Seattle, Washington",4,10/04/2016,a great combination near all Metro stops,"Get the mobile app, read up on city bikelanes, and you can easily cover so much more ground in the city, combined with Metro subways. Some stations will have hard to read screens, so remember what they ask you each rental. People ride on the sidewalks all the time, so don't fret while in downtown, just be curteous. A 3 day rental for 2 was easy to work with. When you do have issues, their CService center takes care of you quick. You should have the app, not just for locations, but also to confirm parking or rental availability."
Peter S,,1,09/22/2016,Don't do this,Pricing for single trip is unclear. Tried to contact the useless customer service which ended up terrible.
Robin C,,1,09/16/2016,Scam Scam Scam,Rented 2 bikes to tour DC.expected to pay $24 or so based on 2 bikes for 3.5 hours based on rates stated on website ie: $8 for 24 hours. Got home only to see cc charges of $124.00 plus the $16 membership fee.Total Scam.Called Capitalbikeshare to no avail getting only 50% credit as they say bikes need to be checked in every 30 minutes.This is also a joke as we looked for 45 minutes to find a bike rack when trying to leave and almost missed bus as first 3 racks were completely full and couldn't even check or return 1 bike. Never will use again.
Colbey R,"Hendersonville, Tennessee",5,09/13/2016,Great bikes. Cheap way to see DC,I grabbed a bike for a solo night tour of the National Mall.  I rode from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol and back.  So much fun for so little money.
Gavin M,,1,09/12/2016,"Deceptive, SCAM!",This is a scam. You think you are getting a bike for $8 for 24 hours. We used them for 3.5 hours. They charged an additional $46 per bike for not docking/ checking it in every 30 minutes. So riding two bikes for 3 hours cost $108.
lanceaviator,"Houston, Texas",1,09/12/2016,Scam! Do not use!,Agreeing with everyone else on this as it is a scam. They advertise making you believe you can use the bike within a 24hr period as much as you want only to surprise you with a large charge on your credit card. If you're using it for less than 30min then go for it but any longer and I advise taking the subway. Also FYI they refuse to give you a full refund if you ask for one and claim that it's because it's a government program and can only refund 50%. They need to be investigated by the BBB and the local government.
tramsey14321,"Fairmont, West Virginia",1,09/08/2016,Shysters! Stay away!,"Renters beware! The limit is 30 minutes per ride, but they make sure to keep it on the down low and in the fine print so you are less likely to pay attention to it and rack up charges. I couldn't believe how lucrative this company is and how they get away with it. Oh wait! It's because of their 132-page terms and conditions document that you have to sign. Until they add a screen (that isn't buried within the 132 pages of terms papers) that reminds riders that they are only limited to 30 minutes per ride, I urge everyone to stop using their bikes! They need to learn that this isn't how you do business and be successful."
RCACC,"Saint John, Canada",5,09/06/2016,Great way to get around without killing your feet,"We had a great time using these bikes that are stragegically located around the city. We used them to park a bit further away - cycle into town - walk around, cycle back. Every once in a while we would cycle through the city too. They are cheap to use - only 2 dollars for up to 30 minutes. Be careful going over the 30 minutes then you pay an extra 8 dollars just for a 24 hr memebership, plus a fee for us of an additional 2 dollars. Fees go up from there.Certainly a good thing to try.Bikes are meant for adults - not for kids."
gobama57,"Leipzig, Germany",5,09/03/2016,Great way to explore all the governmental buildings and monuments on hot days,"Easy to use, available everywhere, we enjoyed touring the different monuments, would definitely rent a bike again in DC"
B8732IOjohng,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",1,08/31/2016,Overcharging is their approach,Be very careful when you rent from them.  They will charge you extra even when you return the bike correctly. Rent and return with great care.
Kim T,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5,08/22/2016,"Eight bucks, no waiting...","Renting a bike in a city used to cost $80 or so for the day, but Capital Bikeshare delivers that for $8. The trick is to keep each ride under 30 minutes each and you can ride all day for nothing more than the daily membership charge of $8. This is, more or less, personal rapid transit around a fairly flat city with a decent number of bike lanes, paths, and (outside the center) ride-able sidewalks."
Donna_Manley,"Memphis, Tennessee",5,08/12/2016,Fun to explore on bike,"I loved the bike share program, especially the cell phone app that shows where the kiosks are and how many bikes are available. It was a little game to figure out where you could get to in 30 minutes to check your bike in and out for another 30 minutes. The bikes were all in good shape. Since my hotel was on a hill, I rode down to Georgetown and then to the mall area (all downhill). It was great to ride in Rock Creek Park. Washington is a very bike-friendly town. When I was finished for the day, I just hopped the metro back up the hill to the hotel."
Woolife,Hamilton,4,08/11/2016,Made Our Trip Amazing,"My boyfriend and I visited DC for the first time this month to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. Being our first time and looking to keep it as a budget friendly trip, we were a bit nervous about how to navigate the city without spending a fortune on Taxi's or Ubers.Capital Bikeshare was our saving grace. I looked into hop on/hop off tours, bike rentals, segway tours...you name it, but they all came with hefty price tags.Bike Rentals were min $20pp per day. Capital Bikeshare has a 3 days Membership for $17pp. This allowed us to have unlimited trips for free for 30 minutes a trip.This allowed us to visit all of the monuments, museums and even bike the city a bit without any worries and saved us so much time. It was also SUPER hot and we were so thankful we had a bike to get us from point a to point b so quickly rather than spending more time in the humid hot sun.The APP is a MUST!!!! I used this APP all weekend not only for bike locations, but as a general GPS - lol. It was great being able to see where we were AND if there was bikes near by if we wanted to grab one.As highly as I recommend this to anyone visiting DC and how I will look into these services in any other city I visit, there is a slight downside which is why I scored them a 4/5 instead of a perfect 5.The downside is hoping to gosh the location you're going to either A) has bikes or B) has open spots for you to dock the bike. The app tells you how many bikes are available and how many open ports there are and is pretty real time, but it is not completely accurate, especially in the really busy locations. In the super busy locations like near the Lincoln Memorial, they truly need MORE bikes. We had a bike that took us there, docked it, and 20 minutes later when we wanted to move on, there were no bikes at the 2 closest locations. We probably spent a good 40 minutes between both stations waiting for a bike. At one point, we saw 3 bikes available, and in the 5 minutes it took us to walk across the street, they were gone. So then I saw that another station a few blocks away had 9 bikes. While we were walking there I saw it go down to 7, then 6, then 4..only for us to show up as a family was booking the last 4 bikes. This happened to us another time where we saw 4 bikes at a location and by the time we got there only 1 was left. And one time we got back to the station near our hotel and it was full so we had to ride 4 blocks away to dock it. Another couple was with us who didn't have the app. They were going to ride to the closest location which also didn't have any available docks so they followed us to the next one. While this didn't deter us from using it, we know it's just due to it being so popular and such a good option to get around the city, I just wish they had more stations, closer together incase of no docks or no bikes, and more bikes!"
Callie H,,5,08/11/2016,The only way to do it! ,"The DC bike share program is fantastic! And the city itself is incredibly bike friendly- lots of bike lanes and accommodating drivers. When you rent the bike, the first 30 minutes are free, then it's $2 for the subsequent 30 minutes. However, if you dock the bike every 30 minutes you continually get the free 30 minutes. So, ride 30 minutes, dock the bike for 5 seconds and then take the very same bike out for another 30 minutes. There are docking stations all over the place, so it's pretty easy to find them. Remember to pass on the left and ring your bell! "
dcliving55,,1,08/10/2016,NOT FOR TOURISTS,"DO NOT USE THESE BIKES IF YOURE A TOURIST. THEY WILL LITERALLY PENALIZE YOU FOR USING THESE BIKES AS A BIKE RENTAL. keep in mind that the ""all day pass"" doesn't mean you can have one bike all day. It actually means that you can only have a bike for 30minutes at a time. pass that time and you will be charged extra. yes even when ascending the trek from georgetown to the national cathedral.I unfortunately had to pay nearly$50 extra because I was misinformed and didnt see the ""fine print."" This is a borderline scamming company and I would never recommend this to anyone."
HeatherJ22,"Columbus, Ohio",5,08/09/2016,Best summer transportation when visiting DC,"Capital Bikeshare depots (the red bikes) are all over the city. Get the app (spot cycle ) for the up-to-date map and bike availability real time!! We get to see so so much more of the city via bikeshare!!! Im so glad we could bike as much as we did, given the busy traffic and tourist. By the way - we only biked on sidewalks which luckily they were pretty wide!"
ispica123,"Norfolk, Virginia",1,08/08/2016,Be Aware!!!,"Questionable Business Tactics!!!!On July 11, while visiting DC, I rented a bike and returned it within 30 minutes. Upon returning the bike, I locked it in place, pulled it a couple of times to verify that it was safely locked, and walked away. The bike was now in the hands of Capital BikeShare and not mine. Days later, upon reviewing my bank statement, I noticed a $94 withdrawal by Capital BikeShare on July 13, in addition to the $2 for the July 11 rental. I had left DC on the 11th and was not in DC on July 13. When I called Capital BikeShare, I was told that I had used the bike for 14 hours......that I had not locked the bike in properly.......that I should have waited 1 minute for the green light to come on.......that other people had used that bike and I was charged for their use (because I failed to lock it in place).........All made up lies, when in fact I DID verify that the lock was firmly secured before I walked away AND only used their bike for 30 minutes on July 11.After repeated rude attempts to talk over me, ""Corey"" mumbled that he would submit a 50% refund. When I asked how Capital BikeShare was going to refund/correct the unauthorized withdrawal, he admitted that he did not know, and rushed to hang up. From the reviews I have read online, I suspect that this is their normal modus operandi. And they do not issue a receipt.Be aware!"
hagenmem,"Fort Myers Beach, Florida",1,08/03/2016,Tourists Beware of Capital Bikeshare,Don't use Capital Bikeshare if you are a tourist.The bikes were great and it's a wonderful way to get around the mall. BUT if you don't return the bikes every 30 minutes they charge you an OUTRAGEOUS amount. I was charged $136 for an afternoon with 2 bikes! They are ripping off tourists. When I called they offered me a maximum of 50% discount (this obviously happens a lot) and an email address for the municipality of DC for further follow up. Go to a local bike shop and rent a bike for a day. Much better deal. You know what you are paying!
Farrierreview,"Preston, United Kingdom",3,08/01/2016,If only you could find a place to drop them off...,"5 is a big number when it comes to cycle share. Actually any number bigger than 1 is an issue. We stayed on Capitol Hill and wanted to cycle the National Mall. Stop at the Lincoln Memorial. Then on to Georgetown. Easy. Finding 5 bikes was a bit of an issue, but the stations aren't far apart. The bikes are heavy, but sturdy and well cared for. Cost looks fair. It only becomes an issue if you are over an hour on any one journey. Ours would be easily under. The problem arrives when you want to drop off. The Mall stations were nearly full, though we managed. Georgetown was completely full. There are 4 stations and we visited them all. Only 1 slot was available. That makes a mockery of the system. You get heavily penalised in cost and can't do what you planned. Be careful. "
Goodtimesrus105,,2,07/26/2016,Trouble with docking and retrival of bikes.,"There are multiple stations everywhere for these bikes, so it's convenient. Also seemed like a lot of fun so our family wanted to get four bikes. We paid for four, but two wouldn't come out with the codes which were supplied at the kiosk. So, two of us rode the bikes and two of us walked to the next station we saw and immediately put them right back in the station. They just don't work well. Based on these other reviews I'm now seeing, I hope my credit card doesn't get charged for the two bikes we couldn't get out of the rack. Seems fun, but these things were just a pain to operate."
emiliewurtz,"Stafford, Virginia",1,07/25/2016,Bad information!!!!!!,We got charged 156 dollars because we didn't know that we had to dock the bikes every 30 minutes.... This was NOT very clear when we rented the bikes - tricks a lot of tourists........
chipeddler,La Crosse,1,07/12/2016,"Read the reviews, terrible.","This seems like a great idea as there are docking stations all over and it sure cuts down the walking. There were 5 of us, with younger children. We were using the app to try to find a place to return the bikes. We were in crowded dt DC and had to walk the bikes. The app would say there were open docks, so we would walk blocks only to find they were not open or not working. So we would walk blocks to another to find the same thing. We lost valuable vacation time, we were exhausted, and then to add insult to injury, we saw the bill. $300 for 5 bikes for about 2 1/2 hours. Be careful. "
Erin C,,4,07/11/2016,Stations Everywhere!,"I was in DC for work and wanted to cram in as much as I could in a very short period of time. Essentially, I did a self-led monument tour on bike, using the Capital Bikeshare program. It was really easy. I opted for the three day membership (I think this option was around 20 bucks) and then biked my heart out. So here is the deal, you get 30 minutes of each ride free. I downloaded one of the apps (I used D.C. Bikes) that shows you where all of the stations are. This handy app also has a timer that helps you remember when 30 minutes is almost up. So, when the timer hit 5 minutes or so, I looked for the closest station (using the app), docked the bike to return it, and then got another bike. If you make sure to return the bike before your free 30 minutes is up, you bike all over town for just the cost of the membership. A couple more pointers.. pick out your bike, adjust the seat, and know where you are going before you swipe your card. That way, you are ready to go and are not wasting time with all this while the clock is ticking. The bikes are a little heavy, but they get you where you are going. Happy biking!"
Greg C,"Kingstree, South Carolina",1,07/06/2016,Poor system,They do not tell you that you need to dock the bikes every 30min so you will not be charged overages. I charged 92 dollars and there refund policy is only 50%of the charge will be returned if an error was found. Waited a week to find out this was their policy. Becareful!!!
kh957,"Coral Springs, Florida",2,07/02/2016,Who reads reviews about bike rentals when visiting DC? YOU SHOULD!,"I didn't. That was a mistake on my part. Like everyone else, I thought that the $8 daily fee was reasonable. I didn't think that it would be a problem swapping out bikes. It was! If I were traveling by myself it wouldn't have been a problem. Traveling in a pair was a hassle; I wouldn't even think of traveling with a family or another couple. Like others have written, bikes aren't always available. Other times there aren't any docking stations. The kiosk display is difficult to read. At time you have to push the button extremely hard to get results. Who takes the time to read the 133 screen pages of the rental agreement? Bottom line: It was great breezing around town on the cruiser; however, I wouldn't do it again unless traveling alone. If you must rent these bikes, carefully dock the bike after use; wait for the GREEN light before you leave; don't wait until the last second to swap bikes and if you do follow the instructions to get your 15 minute credit. Customer service reduced my fees; don't take no for an answer if you are a first time user."
bcanovas,Miami,1,06/30/2016,Happy Bike Rental Until you get back home and get the REAL BILL!,"Many of the positive reviews would really be negative because they bill directly to the credit card and you don't see it until you get your credit card/debit statement! You think it's $8 a day, IT'S NOT! READ THE FINE PRINT (HARD TO DO IN THE SUN). You have to keep returning the bike every 30 minutes or you $$$$ increases. Sometimes the racks are full and you can't return them! Other times their system malfunction! IT'S TIME CAPITAL BIKE SHARE GETS THERE ACT TOGETHER AND STOP SCAMMING!"
SurefireAK,,1,06/29/2016,Rip Off,"They make it seem like ""rent a bike for $8 a day"" but then they have all these ""time fees"" for having the bike out longer than a half an hour. That was annoying, but what was really disappointing was the fact that the dock wouldn't let me get the bike out. Then the light turned red, so I thought, like ANY normal human being, the when the bike was still stuck in the dock and the light was red that I could get a different bike, nope. So I left, well turns out they charged me an extra $30 dollars for time the bike was ""out of the dock"" and won't refund it. Would NOT recommend. Poor customer service and crappy systems."
John H,"Denver, Colorado",5,06/26/2016,Great way to see a lot in a shorter amount of time,"My family and I used the Capital Bikeshare program to tour the memorials on the National Mall. Nothing is better than touring DC at the speed of a cruiser. We had a blast. At first I was nervous because the traffic is so bad, but then I noticed almost everyone is riding on the sidewalks. It's so much easier and more enjoyable than hiking up and down the mall. The only difficult part was returning the bikes when we were done. The bike rack nearest our condo only had one empty port. We returned one of our bikes there and then had to find another rack with open ports to return the other bikes."
rip1331,"Lincoln, Nebraska",1,06/18/2016,Do NOT use the bikes! SCAM!!!!!!!!! MISLEADING COST!!!!!!!!,"This seemed like a great way to get around Washington DC and there were docking stations in very convenient areas. We rented them under the assumption they were $8/day, which seemed reasonable, considering the bikes weren't in that great of shape anyway. The signs lead you to believe this is the true cost. If you don't dock the bikes every 30 minutes, it charges you by the minute and it's very expensive. We found docking stations but they were all full so we were not able to dock our bikes at all and had them out for 4 hours, resulting in the $8 PLUS over $60 in overage charges. I called to complain about the misleading nature of this and she said I should have read the sign better. Judging by the reviews on here, this seems to be a common error with people so perhaps this should be advertised better! I wouldn't ever use this bikeshare again. Total RIP OFF and SCAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Julia O,"New York, New York, United States",1,06/17/2016,"Capital bike share is a scam, tries to make money on your back and worse customer service ever!","I am very upset.I payed 2 memberships of 3 days last weekend, so total 34 dollars,When we returned our bikes after our first trip, my mother had no problem, but me the station signaled a red light. I called immediately the customer service and the person after several advices to try to remove the bike and didn't workout, (she was pretending the problem was coming from their stations but from me!!! 5bikes at this ration were having red light!! She told me that a technician would come later to fix it. In the meantime, she told me I won't be charged for the extra time (because the system didn't consider that my bike was back) and I asked her several times to make sure there was no confusion, and I had hard time getting that answer!Then I was able to use the membership only on Sunday (because my membership was not working until someone fixed the bike!!) where my mother and I used it twice, one trip less than 30min and another one a little bit less than an hour. We had no issue during these 2 returns, the lights were green, and I was very careful for that after my first experience on Friday I can tell you!!!Today I have been charged of 34 dollars of membership + 78 dollars!!!!!So when I called at 7:30am today, the person told me that I used a bike once for 5 hours!!!!It's impossible. Who is lying? I wonder...The person told me that she was requesting a refund of 50% for that extra charge, but it's not fair I need a full refund of the 78dollars.And the fact that because of the first trip (when the light was red), my mother and I were not able to use the bike afterwards until the person came to fix it. So we were not able to enjoy fully the membership during the weekend, so I would also deserve a refund of a part of the membership ! I emailed the support, NO ANSWER!"

They advertise the $8/24 hour part but not to check in and that's where they get your money. Save your money and rent else where! Never again"
Jeff O,,1,06/16/2016,Warning - be careful of this scam!,If you do not dock the bike every thirty minutes you will be charged high fees. $62.00 for  a little over 4 hours.  So much for a relaxing bike ride when you have to watch the time every 30 minutes!

I did have a problem with docking one of the bikes, so I was overcharged. I called them and they fixed the problem fast and easily. They have a system to check for attempts to dock. Customer service was outstanding. This bikes are everywhere in DC, including the outside areas. Using the google maps app helped. Some times some stations would be all busy but for the most part there was another a couple of blocks away that was available. Their map online will show you availability."

I had a 3 day pass and could barely used it because their sistem works so bad that I was afraid of being charged large amounts in the credit card for nothing. We took 2 bikes, but it happend to us, twice in the same day, that only the first code allowed us to take a bike, the second one didnt work so the light went red and couldnt take the bike, but, and here is the most important: their sistem (and the customer service) insisted that both codes were fine and that we had both bikes, thats why they charged on my credit card ""$200"", yes two hundred dollars!!!! The worst thing was the treatment recieved by the people from customer service, who are supposed to help the customers but instesd of doing that they just keep insisting that I was crazy and that both codes were ok and that i should find the other bike (by a bar code thet have sticked on them) and but it back! (Not that easy when the bike never came out). Worst customer service ever!! Next time I will need a notary every time i take a bike so he can certified whenever it works bad!!! And believe me it happens a lot, found lots of people with the same problem as mine!!!"
Gerjola,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",1,06/08/2016,Capital Bikeshare Steal $ from their Customers,"Where would you end up paying $172++ for renting 2 bikes for a day? With Capital Bikeshare... Any regular European would expect the rental to be around $8 for a day, for 1 bike. That seems like a fair and normal charge, right? Would you investigate further and could you ever conceive of being charged $172 on top of the regular rental? Well, watch out, because they can simply slap it on your creditcard. Just like that... So here is where it went wrong for us. We did not understand that we had to dock the bike every 30 minutes. A simple misunderstanding that Capital Bikeshare takes full advantage of. We could have easily docked the bikes, because we used the bike to visit all the tourist sights. However, we were totally unaware that this needed to be done in order to get honored the $8 a day fee. And so, upon leaving Washington, we were presented with a $172 fee. Capital Bikeshare explained us the reasoning behind it, and we explained to them that if we had known of their rules, we would have docked the bikes accordingly. Cut a long story short, they were ""kind"" enough to refund $86. That still left me feeling totally robbed by them though. Will never use them again, and strongly recommend to rent elsewhere, for a day rental. Make sure to research other rental companies, because this one takes full advantage of you not knowing the full rules."
Tony D,,1,06/06/2016,tooooo expensive 3 hours 30 dollars one bike,"All the times I rent bikes the longer u have it the cheaper it gets, not with these people, I paid $30.00 for one bike for 3 hours, the machine instructions are very confusing. read and read very carefully . Stay away from these bikes save your money in DC get UBER."
Kaleigh L,"St. Petersburg, Florida",1,06/04/2016,Fun but expensive $124 for two bikes,"Unfortunately I doubt we will ever use a bike share company again, barring the prices drop significantly. At first glance this seems like such a fantastic idea and such an amazing way to see our nation's capital. Unfortunately it is extremely expensive, I could have bought two used bikes on Craigslist in the capital for what we ended up paying for the two bike rental. 2 bikes for roughly 4 hours, came to a total of $124.00. And I do wish they had a water bottle holder. Also my bike kept slipping out of gear. The price really ruins the experience."
Lynne J,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",1,05/27/2016,Bad experience,"We planned to see the sights using this scheme- after a vain attempt to get 3 bikes from one station we walked to another and managed. We used these for 40 minutes and then spent several hours at Arlington, getting the metro back to the city and then tried to get a further set of bikes. The kiosk informed us that we still had the bikes and so couldn't get anymore. A phone call to the help line established that 1 of the three had a problem with docking- but they could do nothing about it- we could either get back and sort the problem at the last the docking statiin ourselves or an engineer would look at it some time in the next 48 hrs. Meantime the charge was continuing. Not impressed with this as we have used the same system in London on many occasions with no problems. Will not try it again- we will hire bikes for the day as this is cheaper than the excess charges on this scheme"
SebastianS4516,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",4,05/25/2016,Lovely way to visit DC,"It's very easy to get one of the bikes from the docking stations, that are located almost all around the important areas of the city's downtown, although it's not clear how to get a new bike once you left your first bike and try to get a new one at a new station. There's also an app which I haven't tried, I imagine it'd be helpful to try it. The stations are also in spanish."
randallscheessele,"Alexandria, Virginia",1,05/22/2016,Capital Bike Share needs to maintain their machines and not blame the customers,"I left a bike at Braddock Metro and properly locked it in. I checked it three times to make sure it was locked in. Customer service at first said that the bike could not be located. then they could see that it had been locked at the station but ""improperly so"". They said that they would have to send a technician out to see if it was still there. Their computers monitor these things and they could have sent a technician when it ""pinged"" as the lady called it. Better yet, they could check their stations to see if they are functioning when they move around the bikes each day."
foxsmjr,"Miami Beach, Florida",4,05/11/2016,"Great way to traverse the Mall, but be watchful of your time !","Capital Bikeshare is great, easy, and fun way to quickly zip around the National Mall taking in all the sights to see. My boyfriend and I took two bikes from the Jefferson Drive station - nearest the Washington Monument, and proceeded on a clockwise tour around the Tidal Basin taking in the Jefferson Memorial, George Mason Memorial, Tidal Basin sights and Cherry Trees, FDR Memorial, MLK Memorial, DC War Memorial, Lincoln Memorial, Reflecting Pool, Vietnam Memorial, 56 Signers of the Declaration and pool, the WWII Memorial, the White House, finally and Capitol Hill before riding our bikes back down the Hill past the Smithsonians and returning our bikes, ultimately back to the same original station on Jefferson Drive. Aggravatingly, between all those sights, there is only one station over between the FDR memorial and Lincoln memorial to park the bikes again and reset the 30 min free window of time. This makes it impossible to pay the $8 for a daily pass and maintain a free charge by staying under 30 mins, as there is simply not enough bike stations to check your bike back in, not to mention you'll find yourself easily spending at least 30 mins or more at each memorial if you really take your time to relax and take in the feeling of each sight. In the end, we were charged much more than we expected, but after doing the math it was the correct charge as advertised. In hind sight, I would do it again as riding the bikes sure did beat walking, (there is no way possible to cover that much ground on foot and not want to kill each other from exhaustion and aching feet), feeling the wind as you bike along, and laughing the whole way riding along made the entire experience on the Mall so much more enjoyable. Just be prepared to spend about $50 a person so you won't feel suckered when you see the charges appear on your card."
Amanda H,,1,05/11/2016,HORRRRRRIBLEEE SCAM ARTISTS,Horrible HORRRRRRRRible service. they say you have a 24 hour membership and then charge you for ever hour after 30 minutes. even worse customer service!
Iammerry,,2,05/10/2016,Be careful using your credit card ,I had a great time biking for 2 days in DC and was happy with the capital bikeshare. But then I found out that I was charged $54 and the transaction happened when I was no longer in DC. I called the customer service and was informed that my credit card was used at a location that I have never been to. They cancelled the transaction and I have to wait for 7-10 business days. Please check your credit card transactions after using the card for the bikeshare. I hope this won't happen again to anyone else. 
steph_tourstheworld,"Pompano Beach, Florida",2,05/09/2016,Broken & Full return stations make this less fun,"We rented some bikes as an easy way to make it around to see the monuments in the mall and tidal basin area. We left from the Lincoln memorial where we easily rented two bikes. We rode around the basin and attempted to turn in our bikes by the Jefferson memorial only to find the station full. This shouldnt have been a big problem because you can get an extra 15 minutes if the station is full, but the kiosk was broken. So I called the number for help, and they were unable to provide us with an extra 15 minutes over the phone. Finally we rode back round to the Washington Monument and returned our bikes there. When we went to take out new bikes after touring the monument, we couldnt...not sure why, but it wouldnt let us take a new bike with our codes, so we gave up. I've done this in other cities without issue, not sure why this particular program was so rough."
SpokaneLori,"Spokane, Washington",5,05/02/2016,Great way to see all the sights!,"We used Capital Bikeshare for the two days we were in DC with our two teenagers, and it was a lifesaver, and so much fun! It allowed us to see all of the sights, more than once, without having to walk everywhere or take other transit. I see some people complaining about the lack of docking stations near the museums, or the cost being high, yet we didn't find either of these to be the case. The key is to read the instructions...you can do so ahead of time online at their website. There is also a free app you can download ahead of time to help you find the docking stations. We found stations near all the places we went (Lincoln memorial, Space museum, capital, our hotel, etc.). To use them the most economically...rent them for 24 hours or 3 days. Then, as long as each time you ride them it's 30 minutes or less until you check it back in to a docking station, there is no charge. So we just got the bike, rode to the next sight we wanted to see, checked the bike in, explored the sight, and then got another bike to ride to the next sight. If you lock it up, then you're going to be paying for all that time that you aren't using it...just find a station, dock it, and get another bike once you're done exploring the memorial or the museum. A couple of times we used the bike over 30 minutes (like when we rode to Arlington Cemetery), and it was just $2 more. THE KEY IS TO CHECK THE BIKE IN, EXPLORE, AND THEN GET ANOTHER BIKE. Our kids loved this, and we did, too. And doing this at night all around the mall to see the beautiful lights was the highlight of our trip. The paths are large, and easy to maneuver on the bikes. And even riding to our hotel or to a restaurant, as long as the sidewalks weren't super crowded, we could just ride on the sidewalks. The bikes have a bell on them, so you can alert walkers that you are approaching. This is the way to go in DC!"
Silverbell603,"Keene, New Hampshire",1,05/01/2016,Scam! Do NOT give these criminals your money!,Shame on them for their predatory pricing! Promised $8 a day but charged $102 on credit card and when questioned said that riders need to dock the bikes every 30 minutes not to incur extra fees. The cowards use a 3rd party customer service department and won't release their own phone number. The customer service company says they regularly give50% back on the fees but aren't authorized to give more. They count on people giving up. It is obvious that they charge so high to suck hundreds of dollars out of many people & still laugh while getting 50% from those of us that call them on their scam. Don't ride - RUN! Run away from these scam artists.
Court701,"Bismarck, North Dakota",4,04/28/2016,Easy and cheap,This was the first time I had ever used any type of biking system in a big city. The bikeshare was easy to understand and was actually a pretty cheap was of transportation. I loved the fact that you could just grab one and then return it to a location where you were going. The only downside is that sometimes the dock you want to return it to is full and you end up having to ride around to find another one. But we did download the app which helped us find all the docks. Its really a nice way to see the city if you prefer not to walk. 
SMMHermans,"Monster, The Netherlands",4,04/25/2016,perfect with teenagers,"We have 2 teens (16 and 17) and they just loved visiting the city on bike. We have done a lot of citytrips and this time for the first on bike. The weather was nice and the traffic (sunday) was ok. Tip: you can only rent 2 bikes on 1 creditcard. so make sure you have enough cards! Make sure you print a good map at home so you can find the docks!! (or if you have internetacces, download the app!) We didn't and had to search a lot. What we didn't like: a few times there were not enough bikes in the docks for the four of us. And sometimes a few bikes just didn't got out the dock."
Z400VHpeterp,"Beenleigh, Australia",3,04/24/2016,"Need more bikes, more docks","GREAT idea, very convenient. But only if there are spare bikes where you wish to pick one up, and spare docks where you wish to end your journey. Can get expensive if you can't get to a dock within 30 mins of starting. Very tiring if there are no bikes left and you have to walk a long way to the next station. Otherwise a great option, cheaper than metro and enables you to see a lot more than you could on foot. "
AlisonStumpf,Minnesota,5,04/24/2016,Excellent and fun way to see the city,"My daughter and I were so glad when we figured out the 'deal' with the bikes and rented them for a evening trip to the monuments. It was one of the best memories of our trip. One thing about DC is that many attractions shut down after 5 and one doesn't always know what to do to occupy that time. We absolutely LOVED the bikes and we rode out to Jefferson Memorial which is hard to get to otherwise. I would have felt better having a bike lock to secure our bikes when we got to places, as I was afraid someone might steal or take our bike, so that might be a suggestion to bring along.....but it all worked out well and was a cheap and fun way to see the monuments."
C R,"Evanston, Illinois",1,04/18/2016,Impossible to dock the bike!,"This morning I lost an hour biking around in the hot sun trying to find an empty dock. I spent so much time that I missed an appointment. I went to 3 full bike thingies and met a guy who had also had 3 unsuccessful attempts in the opposite direction! I called the phone number on my printed receipt in tears because by this time I had to eat or would have a diabetic ""low"". Really ! You guys need to plan ahead or don't offer the bikes. Finally I went back to a bike location I had been to before, and a van was there taking bikes off the docks so we could dock our bikes. Worst bike share in DC!!!!"
craigcN9891HF,"Columbus, Ohio",4,04/18/2016,This is the way to get around the mall area,"We visited Washington DC the weekend of the Cherry Blossom parade. We have CoGo in Columbus, same bikes, same parent company and decided to commute by bike as much as possible. There are docking stations near just about every major and a few minor monuments. The station close the Lincoln had a long line of people wanting to get bikes and a long line of people checking them back in.As we use our local bike share all of the time we are familiar with the rules and how to make them work for you. Read the rules on the website or kiosk first. You don't want to end up getting charged more than you should.I only gave this one 4 stars and the one in Columbus I gave 5. That is because I rode 3 different bikes and all three needed some maintenance done to them."
ffmunson,"Joliet, Illinois",5,04/15/2016,Second best way to see the sights,In town for conference. When got done for the day went and rented the bike. Used the 3 day rental. Can use it when and wherever you wanted for the three days.All you do is put in your credit card answer a couple of questions and remember your code. So much nicer than walking all over the city. Just use the bike lanes and be careful. Only thing was not having a bike lock... However nobody stole our bikes.Have Fun.
Amy C,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5,04/09/2016,Freedom on Wheels,"I try to bike in every city that I visit but knowing the horrendous traffic quagmire that is DC I was a little reticent about biking in DC. That was until two days ago when I took Amtrak to DC and decided to give Capital Bikeshare a try. What a great experience. The bicycles are in great shape, the kiosks are easy to use, the response time from the kiosks is quick, and the kiosks are located in very convenient locations. I would suggest that bikeshare find a way to let riders tell the system what maintenance needs to be done to each bike ( a missing bell on one, a slipping second gear on another).I was very brave and road up Mass Ave all the way to 15th Street from the very convenient Union Station Bikeshare kiosk. No muss, no fuss. Parked at 21st and M, went for coffee and then picked up a new bike to travel back across town to 7th and F. Capitol Bikeshare has a great website that makes it very easy to find where kiosks are located, if there are slots available at the kiosk of choice, and helps you plan your trips. I think that from now on when I am in DC I will skip the Metro, bus and cabs - I will use Capitol Bikeshare and have freedom from waiting in underground caverns for crowded subway cars, paying for parking in lots, and searching for elusive parking spaces.Next time you are in DC, give Capital Bikeshare a try. You won't be disappointed."
MatLet,"Roswell, Georgia",5,04/09/2016,Rented it for 3 days,"My son realty wanted to ride a bike around the city instead of doing the standard tours. Ended up being a lot of fun. You pay for a 1 day or 3 day membership and then you pay by the hour or half day or whole day. You can download an app to find the nearest bike stand so you can dock it and not be charged while you are touring things. Only issue is there are no bike stands on the mall. So if you are going museum to museum you need to lock it to something. If you are seeing this review before you go to DC then bring a bike lock so you can lock it up. We had to skip the museums as I did not feel comfortable leaving the bikes without a lock while we toured. We did ride them from our hotel on H street all the way to the White House, Washington Monument, on to WWII Memorial, Lincoln Memorial and then to the Zoo. There is a wonderful bike path to the zoo I highly recommend it. We did dock the bikes in front of the zoo and took the Metro home. "
IAKA2014,"Uppsala, Sweden",2,04/04/2016,"Good that they exist, bad that they are overpiced and unsafe","Washington D.C. is not a city to ride a bike. The traffic is heavy, and the bike lanes are not safe (if they exist). Even if you decide to hire this bike, be aware that it costs 8 dollars for a day enrolment fee and then - it is free only first 30 minutes, then it is 2 dollars for the next 29 minutes and even more for the time to follow. With the Washington D.C. distances this means you have to pay constantly extra fees. Besides, if you are a tourist, it is always uneasy to find a bike stand (if you do not have mobile with the internet connection with you). It seems that these bike stands are deliberately hidden on the back streets, so you loose time just for looking for them and pay extra. And there are not enough of these stands. You can easily arrive with your bike and find no free slot to park it. Overall impression - Capital Bikeshare wants to earn money on you without thinking about your convenience and safety. In comparison to Vienna city bikes, for example, this provides bad impression. Not a single stand near National Gallery, or Space museum, of Natural History Museum, the most popular places. You have to make circles and circles in order to find a bike stand on the back side of the Orangery (not the most obvious place!) and to walk from there."
pearlkrg,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",5,03/30/2016,Spontaneous Self-Guided Evening Monument Tour,"Streets and paths are too congested over Spring Break to ride bikes during the day. We took an evening bike tour as a family and it was a highlight! After endless walking and weary feet, we covered a lot of ground and enjoyed seeing the city lit up at night. Evening monument tours were sold out but this was still fabulous and much cheaper. Just know where the stations are to dock near the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Memorial when you want to take a closer look. Read other reviews to understand the pricing system first. "
nuttiskyn,"Boston, Massachusetts",1,03/21/2016,Horried Customer Service,"Be warned, their customer service will not help in any issue. Be sure you use a credit card that will accept and process a chargeback since their customer service dept. is incapable of assisting. Buy a nicer pair of shoes, take a cab or the Metro."
Laura D,"Athens, Georgia",4,01/16/2016,Bring your own helmet,"The rental bikes provided my family a convenient & inexpensive way to get around. We were able to get to all of the museums & monuments quickly on our own schedules. My only complaint is that there were no helmets to be found anywhere in all of Washington! Any real cyclist knows that people who ride without helmets are referred to as ODs (organ donors). As a nurse, I did not feel comfortable allowing my family to ride in the streets without helmets. Fortunately, the locals did not seem to mind us riding on the sidewalks (still not safe, but better than riding in traffic)."
wanderingkale,"Valdosta, Georgia",5,12/29/2015,Great system for getting around,"So for 8 bucks, you get unlimited 30 minute trips for a day. There are so many bike share stations around the popular landmarks, you can't go wrong with this. We were able to basically see all the monuments and memorials in one day thanks to grabbing a bike and riding around. A great system."
280AshleyC280,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5,10/28/2015,Great way to get around,"I love how bike friendly DC is! They have biker paths everywhere and lots of stations with the bike share program so pretty much anywhere you are going within the area a station is close by. Its $8 fee for the day. Then you can use the bike for 30 minutes for free, once you put back in bike station the time is stopped. I think its about $2 for each additional 30 mins you have it out, but you could easily stop at a close station check in and check back out to keep the free time going. It was a great way for us to get around and tour museums/monuments "
kaioatey,The Bay Area,3,10/23/2015,good but... more expensive than it might seem,"At first this looks like a good - and fair - deal - you rent a bike for 1.5 hours for $16. But this is just a teaser - every 30' extra will set you off another $8. Thus, this service is best if you plan to have several trips of limited duration, but with total time <90 min. I really do not see the reason why they would need to set such extortionate prices. Then of course there are the unpredictable snafus... you trying to park the car late at night just aching to go to sleep and find all slots are taken; so wearily off to find another parking slot God knows how far away. I'd recommend for short distances in an area with many bike slots and parking spaces. Otherwise - the company will bleed you dry. "
D b,Merced,4,10/19/2015,Visiting Memorials the Easy Way,"We had walked the National Mall, Grey line toured and done the hop on hop off to visit the monuments and memorials but nothing has beat the bikeshare ride. My husband's knees are bad and I'' jus plain out of shape so when we decided to take our grandson to Washington over fall break we weren't sure how we would visit everything that he wanted to see. We got off the metro at the Smithonian stop, rented the bikes and off we went. We were able to visit everything and ride over to the White House. Most of this area is flat or a very genial slope which seemed to be downhill both ways!The app isn't GPS enabled so we had to do a little searching for the kiosk and is not entirely accurate on the availability for returns. We did the daily rate and kept the bikes for the entire time. If you were wise and returned them every 30 minutes the 8.00 daily fee is all you would pay."
SFantle101,"Bellevue, Washington",4,09/23/2015,A great way to see DC,"What a great concept - bike on demand! I used it extensively during my extended weekend visit, accompanying two locals with ""real"" bikes. Even though these bikes are built like tanks and only 3 speeds, I was able to keep up and felt pretty comfortable (beware of chafing after riding too much though). The lights are mostly for being seen, rather than seeing, so be careful riding at night. I found out the hard way that the service is only available in the District, as my ride across the bridges to Virginia ran up a hefty fine for a late check-in. I see from other reviews that there are stations in Maryland, so that helps. Seeing the city by bike was much more fun than driving, especially once I understood which streets were bike-friendly."
vinyl45s,"Valley City, Ohio",4,09/20/2015,Worth a try but know how the system works!,"First lets start off that people need to understand how this system works. Most of the complaints here are because they do not read or understand how the bikeshare works. Do people really think they are getting a bike for $8.00 a day and that is it? It is a membership and if you go over 30 minutes without checking in the bike there will be extra charges.Do keep in mind there will be bike stations that have no bikes or there are no docks. There will be bike that do not work and docks that are broken.You want to make sure if you are riding and pass a bike station to check the bike in,. You can not be sure your destination station will have empty slots. You can get 15 minutes extra time if there is no slots to drop the bike. However you need to know where the next station is. That may also be full. There are maps of the locations at the stations but there is no place at the station that you can check the status. There are apps available for cell phones but they are not that reliable. They are not always up to date or the app does not work. The Capital Bikeshare app it has for itself never worked. Try Spotcycle or others.We had two bikes and rode about 15 miles over the two days and 2 1/2 hours hours of use, It was easy to check in the bike and get the same bike out again. There we a few spots there were no empty slots. What we did if there was only one slot was to check in one bike, get it out again and check in the other bike and get that out again. That we we got another 30 minutes until we could find an open station. One time we had to go to 3 stations before we could return both bikes together. One time we had to check-in and leave one bike and then go drop the the other bike at the coral bike station at 13th and New York Ave then walk backKeep in mind commuters ride the bikes to downtown to work and take them back near their home. We found walking and riding around that most of the bike stations where full around the downtown area and the museums.during the day with people waiting for an empty slot to open up.We used the bike system for 2 days and had a day key card for convenience. We could have got a day membership or 3 day membership but then you have to use a code each time. There is also the question of the deposit charged for each bike. I never got a clear answer from customer service on this. We were not charged a deposit with the day key card.There is also a problem with Capital Bikeshare answering e-mails. They don't respond. Not once did they respond to any e-mails I sent in weeks prior to the trip. I ended up calling most times.. I also brought it to there attention of the negative reviews here and other sites that they should address. They did not seem to care.Still we wanted to give this a try. It worked out fine even with the hassle of finding a open bike station to drop a bike. The bikes are nice and study and easy to use.Give it a try but know how it works!"
Alipet17,"Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia",5,09/11/2015,"Convenient, cheap and healthy","I use these whenever I vist DC. Fantastic way to get around the city. Stations all over the place - google maps can help you find nearest stations and if you look at the colour of the marker you can see whether there are empty docking stations, bikes available etc.. Use your overseas credit card with confidence - I'm always surprised at just how cheap it is, even with the crappy conversion back to AUS dollars. The bikes are comfortable, easy to ride, have convenient storage straps at the front to carry yor gear. Highly recommended"
Travlin_boy,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5,09/03/2015,Great Way to See the D.C. Region and Get Fit,"Capital Bikeshare has over 350 stations with 3,000 bikes.

There are stations along the National Mall and Iwo Jima in Arlington, exciting neighborhoods with restaurants and nightlife, and at Metro stations. You can buy a 24-hour or 3-day membership and then each trip under 30 minutes during your membership period is included in the membership price.

trnfla,Tampa,5,08/23/2015,Great way to see the city. ,"First understand the way they charge. You sign up for a day, but if your trip takes longer than 30 minutes you have to pay additional. But you can take as many 30 minutes or less trips a day for the $8Make sure that you download Spotcycle app to find the bike racks. I found lots of bikes but the app was the best way to find open slots to return the bikes. Great way to get around downtown DC"

RUN, RUN, RUN as fast as you can AWAY FROM THIS SERVICE. If you are determined to go through with your rental from Capital Bikeshare, then take the 30 minutes at the kiosk while people are waiting behind you to rent a bike and READ THE NUMEROUS PAGES OF FINE PRINT on that tiny screen! Your 24-hour rental for which you think you are paying $8 when you select that option on the screen is NOT $8. You are actually renting the bike for 30 minutes! The 24 hours is simply the amount of time your access code will be valid. If you keep that bike longer than 30 minutes you're going to rack up some hefty ""overtime"" charges. Apparently, that bit of information is buried in the fine print. Very misleading, in my humble opinion. I will NOT be using this service again!"
Tara1994,"Fairfield, Connecticut",2,08/05/2015,Too many glitches for a large family,"We are a family of 6. This is prob a great service for two people to take advantage of but MAJOR flaws for a family with 4 kids! We started the rental process which is rather cumbersome and takes several minutes per bike. We only wanted to go from the Lincoln Memorial to the Holocaust museum so seemed easy enough. We got two bikes out (clock starts running on rental time as soon as that first leaves the docking station) and discovered the following:- We discovered the hard way that you can only rent TWO bikes per credit card ACCOUNT. Although we had four credit cards between us, we could only rent 4 bikes because they were linked to only two accounts. (our other Visa number was stolen at the start of our trip and that account was shut down). The machine spit out ticket codes and it took quite awhile for us to realize it was simply reissuing the rental code numbers that didn't work. After we gave up and I RAN the entire way in 98 degrees trying to keep up with my kids on their bikes, my husband realized it was just Reissuing the codes that my daughters had already used to release their bikes. By the time we rented the first four bikes, and gave up on the last two, we were probably already 15 minutes into our rental period. When we got to the docking station nearest the Holocaust museum, there weren't enough open slots to dock the four bikes.... so we needed to find another location a few blocks past our destination, return the bikes there, and then come back on foot. (Our kids are 16, 14, 12, & 10.... the 10 year old just barely was able to reach the pedals with the seat lowered all the way. There are no helmets so bring your own)"
jfelle1,"Chicago, Illinois",3,08/04/2015,As long as you understand the rules its a great way to see DC.,"We have bike share in my city so I was aware of the 30 minute rule and we planned our routes accordingly. I don't remember how easy to understand the rules posted on the signs. I remember noticing it was 200 deposit per bike so I am guessing there were more rules on display. Dont let the bad reviews scare you. Its not a scam but you have to work the rules. DC is a great biking city. I found it very safe and easy to get around. There were a few times we noticed that the preferred location for drop off or pick up was going to be full/empty so double check the website before and plan your route for your best experience. The reason for my 3 star review had to do with the pay machines. At my height, with the sun glaring and then again when it was dark out, I could not read the displays. Also the computer prompts did not work very well."
Pyra-Danny,"St. Petersburg, Florida",5,07/15/2015,PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS,"It seems a lot of the unhappy reviews revolve around misreading (or ignoring) the 30-minute rule with the bikes and therefore paying a hefty overage fee… and DANG yeah it can get pricey. But if you stick to the rules… $8 for a full 24 hours is an awesome deal! Between that and the metro there was never a need for my tourist self to get a car.THERE’S STATIONS EVERYWEHREEspecially in the tourists areas—there’s like a bike station a short walk from every memorial. Getting the station’s app is very helpful because it not only shows station locations, but they show how many bikes are available as well as how many places to return your bike (We had trouble in some less visited areas because the bike racks were totally full and we had to double back and return our bikes elsewhere)BIG AND BULKY BIKESI’m a petite lady who rides a road bike. It took me a few minutes to get used to these—as cruisers they just seemed HUGE plus I never got fully used to the wide placement of the handlebars. But once moving I never had problems with the bike itself."
cs34109,"Santa Rosa, California",5,07/13/2015,Awesomely convenient,"This is the best way to see DC. Stations are numerous and easy to manage. Much cheaper than taxi or uber. $8 for 24 hour rental! DC is flat with many bike lanes. Ride the mall, monuments, museums. Download Spotcycle app. It's a game changer. Tells you where nearest stations are and how many bikes are at each station. And it's not just DC. Worldwide. "
David270443,"Eden, Australia",3,07/12/2015,Good for short commuting,"A convenient way to get around the city, but do it in 30 minute bites! The first 30 mins is ""free"" then it adds $2 for next 2 hours.etc. the bikes are heavy and cumbersome- so if you like road bike, it is a cruiser! They have 3 gears, but rarely need to change around Washington.Limited locations, so may need to Plan a jog to nearest "
Iván V,,1,07/08/2015,charged us 16 dollars plus 44 dollars for 2 hours of 2 bikes,"Capital Bikeshare, you really should think about improving the interface if 4 people that were there didn't realize that we were going to be charged 44 dollars of extra fees for renting 2 bicycles for 2 hours if we didn't dock the bikes each 30 mins, what sounds a bit like a cover ‎fraud for some of us."
Aujourdhui2,Suburb of Houston,4,07/06/2015,Fun and easy but can get expensive if you're not careful.,"We used these bikes to get around DC for two days for a total cost of $22 each. They cost $8 per day, and the first 30 minutes of usage is free; after that, the per hour charges can get pretty steep. They can be checked out as many times as you want during a 24 hour period. We made a game of figuring out how to get from here to there in less than 30 minutes, and if we couldn't, we found a docking station, turned in the bikes, and checked them right back out. On a hot day, it sure beat walking."
nickatnight777,Atlanta,1,07/06/2015,Usurious usage fees! Not 8 dollars. Charged me 78 dollars for a 5.5 hour bike rental. Totally misleading fine print.,"As the lady on the phone told me this is a bike Sharing program not a bike rental program. The first 30 minutes are free (or included in the 8 dollar full day rental) Check it in every 30 minutes and you wont be charged beyond that 8 bucks. Hence the name share. If you go longer than that prepare to open a vein and pay in green hulk blood. 5.5 hours cost me 78 bucks? Seriously? I called into my credit card to dispute it and they did a three way call with me to Capital Bike share who said as a courtesy they could remove half the initial 70 dollar charge so they gave me back 35 bucks. I was going to leave it at that as a lesson learned in capital nonsense when the lady got rude with me and said, sorry I couldn't read the fine print on the kiosk or in the prompts. (14 pages) of it. I told her. Hey, Im no dummy.. Lots of others complaining about this on trip advisor. I just didn't see it until it was too late and your fine print is clearly misleading. She continued being snippy so I said I wont be using you ever again and now Im going to leave some negative social media complaints. I cant run a business like they are and they should not be allowed too either. For what it is, 30 minute bike sharing, for 8 bucks a day its an overpriced service. For what it allows. Bike rentals for 15 bucks an hour its a total loss. Stay away."
cc j,,2,07/06/2015,No bike parking near smithsonian ,"I just spent a half hour riding around the smithsonian trying to find an open spot to park the bike.They are all full. I missed the chance to see the museum, but did get to see grumpy tourists act like bike gangs as they couldn't park either "
Shayla M,"Bowie, Maryland",1,07/02/2015,Misleading prices,"So this morning I was charged $62 by capital bike share and I was very upset about that. I was upset because I rented bikes yesterday for me and my friend for 24 hours which was supposed to only be $16. So this morning I called customer service number about the charge and the lady said I was charged $62 because apparently we are supposed to return them every 30 minutes or they would charge fees. First of all I would like to say when we rented the bikes we didn't see that rule ANYWHERE!!! Second of all, I don't think that's a smart rule to have because why should people have to check-in the bike every 30 minutes when most people get it for an all day bike ride. People should not have to worry about finding a capital bike dock station and worry about getting charged if they don't check-in on time. I genuinely feel I’ve been wronged/scammed because again I did not see that rule anywhere on the screen when I was renting the bikes and neither did my friend. And I know they do that on purpose to make more money, mostly targeting tourists. But THIS NEEDS TO STOP NOW!!! Im seeing more and more people complaining about this problem. They need to understand that scamming people WILL NOT help their business in the long-run. So I STRONGLY don't recommend using bikeshare."
Northportgal,,2,06/25/2015,Not the greatest experience,"In one weekend had the extremes of experiences with Capital Bikeshare. One day of rental was fun and we got the hang of returning the bikes every 30mins. Although be prepared to find full bike stations that you have to use the app and be racing to find a location before you get an extra charge. The next day we decided to rent again, biked over to the Botanical Gardens, came out and couldn't check out 2 bikes. Calling customer service told us one bike was still checked out, we had checked both in and got the green light when docking. Since we now couldn't get 2 bikes we had to walk back across town to our hotel and were in poor spirits now that a bike was in our name that we didn't have. Customer service told me they would call me with updates, they never did, I called every hour with minimal updates, had to leave DC not knowing the resolution to the issue. Thankfully bike was returned and they did credit day of rental to me. Although half of my weekend to DC was ruined and their customer service needs significant improvement in how they talk with customers and choice of phrasing in email communications. The right thing to do would have been to let me rent out a 2nd bike so we could have enjoyed the rest of our Sunday. I have since asked around and will use Bike and Roll the next time I return to DC. Never Capital Bikeshare again, not worth it."
Diane D,"Hamburg, New York",1,06/24/2015,"Outrageous usage fees, intentionally misleading pricing","I’m echoing what others have said, which is that this is kind of a scam. The way the website is laid out seems to be intentionally misleading, stating “Membership and Usage Fees”, with a chart below that clearly shows “24 hour $8”, “3 Day $17”, etc. but you have to scroll down to see that usage fees are listed - and charged - separately. I had the bike for 3 hours and was charged the $8 at the terminal, and then got hit with a $38 charge later on my card. When I called them I was told you have to re-dock the bike every 30 minutes to avoid the fees. We were in DC as tourists and thought the bikes would be a great way to see the memorials, and when we were done we couldn’t find a station with 2 open spots so I had to go a mile out of our way to find somewhere to drop mine. But this was all too bad for me, as the supervisor, Bud, told me. He was clearly unconcerned with my plight and reduced the charge somewhat, but not entirely. In doing some further research I’ve also found that the company has received $16 million in government subsidies as it is supposed to be helping low-income people commute and maintain employment. Good luck with that with the fees they charge! There’s no way anyone on a tight budget could handle these, and the company is clearly looking to make a big, fat profit off anybody who doesn’t read and understand the convoluted rules – while also taking our tax payer dollars. Really, really disappointing."
Paul T,,4,06/22/2015,"Simple, Straightforward & A Great Way To See The City.","We had walked around all morning and visited so many sights, we eventually decided to give these bikes a go; we started somewhere near Capitol Hill and ended near of our hotel near Dupont Circle. The bikes are inexpensive to use and it's really simple - there are bays everywhere, so you needn't worry about dropping them off or starting a new rental. The bikes are also good quality and I had no problems riding them in traffic or on walk ways. These are a great way to get around the city. **Happy to answer questions**"
sarahfina_6,"Lynn, Massachusetts",4,06/15/2015,great method to get around and easy to use.,"My husband and I rented bikes when leaving the National's game one night as the Metro was swamped with people.Easy to find pick up spots and drop off stations. And plenty of locations as well.The first 30 minutes is free, so if you really want to beat the system, you can find a bike station at 25 minutes, check the bike in and then get a new code to take it out again right away"
900rb,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",4,06/13/2015,Conveniant,"Capital bikeshare is a conveniant way of getting around in Washington. The only trick is to find the bike stations and get to the next station in time to avoid a penalty. This can be a chalenge with the multiple - mostly red - traffic lights in DC. We had to problems. No bikes at Jefferson and no station at Arlington (this is a shame, for such an important monument - Rosslyn is to far away)."
Izziomelis,,5,06/12/2015,Excellent way to move around the city of keep fit while enjoying Washington DC,"Being in washington DC for a business meeting, it was excellent to have the possibility to rent a bike and explore Washington DC bike trails.
It is something all big cities should do."
AZTrailBlazer,"Glendale, Arizona",4,06/11/2015,The best way to see the monuments is by bike! Saves your legs and time.,"The red bikes are available through out the city. You can use the website or APP to find your nearest back rack and availability. This is a nice feature during rush hour as bikes go quick. We used the bikes as tourist, but they are also used by the residents. Bikes located in popular areas go quick. Not to worry as another rack of bikes is usually on a few blocks away. You can return bike to any bike rack.We used the bikes on two different occasions. One day we toured the Mall, and Monuments: Washington, WWII, Vietnam, Korean, Lincoln, FDR, and Jefferson. It was nice to not walk, not have to park a car, and just leisurely ride around.Save your legs. Who wants to walk after being in a museum? Worth the price."
Roxypal,Wyoming,1,06/08/2015,Cheaper if you BOUGHT a bike,"Those red bikes look so great and we rented them and zipped all around on them for two days and it was a lot of fun. We loved riding our bikes to the Capitol, all around the monuments. Problem is they hook you on the $8 a day idea, and they are NOT $8.00 a day. So yeah, it's very deceptive and misleading and not an honest way to do business. But hey those red bikes are awesome. Just prepare yourself for major sticker shock when you look at your credit card -- I actually could have bought a new bike for what I paid Capital Bikeshare for renting for two days. Major bummer."
LisaHVT,Burlington VT,5,06/04/2015,Got me everywhere,"I got the three day plan for $17 and it was money well spent. These bikes got me everywhere I wanted to go.The bikes can be taken out for 1/2 hour at a time - they aren't intended for long-term rentals - but 1/2 hour was usually all I needed to get where I wanted to go. A couple of times I returned a bike, waited a few minutes, and took out another one for the next leg of my trip.I covered so much ground during a 3 day trip to DC!"
wheels2015,"New York City, New York",4,06/04/2015,Awesome,"I had a few hours to kill before a business conference on a Sunday afternoon. The Weather was beautiful. Easy to access. Roads within DC around the mall and ellipse and Capitol were all bike friendly and traffic was light and even some dedicated bike lanes. Reasonably priced, great exercise and it allowed me to see many more sights than just taking a taxi or metro. I would highly recommend taking the bike and I am not in great shape or a regular biker. "
Eileen2five,"Syracuse, New York",4,05/27/2015,Fun way to get around,"We used Capital Bikeshare after walking the Mall and wanting an easy, fun way to get around the rest of the city. I quick downloaded the app and found some bikes. Some people at the station had trouble with their codes (you get a code when you pay for your bike that you enter to get the bike out) but we didn't have any issues. Beware that the pay stations are extremely slow. You have to push a button, wait for it to register, push the next. That was the only issue we had and had a lot of fun biking around. Highly recommend!"
Jaci S,"Victoria, Canada",5,05/25/2015,We loved it.... Just be aware of the rules ,"We really enjoyed the bike share. We used it to hop off and on, to get to different points all around the city. You do need to be mindful of the time, as the cost is $8/ day, then charged by the half hour for use. The first 30 min is free, but if you keep it longer than that, the charges add up fast. It is meant to be taken out, ridden somewhere and docked within 30 min. It is $2/30 min after that. If you want to bike more, sign it out again and you get another 30 min free to go somewhere else..... So just remember to dock it every 30 min, as you go from site to site,memorial to museum. It really is very convenient. There is even an app that will tell you how many bikes are available at any given location. A couple other points- only 2 bikes are allowed per credit card, so for our family of four we needed 2 credit cards. Also, if there is a red light on the bike in the dock, it means it is broken and can't be signed out. Bottom line- use it as to and from transportation, dock it while you are in places, and enjoy!! If you want a bike for the whole day, rent from a store, not from this commuter service! "
podporae,,1,05/21/2015,Horrible!!,There is no transparency in their business practices...I rented two bikes (advertised as 7 dollars a day) and got charged over $160 dollars for this..the shady part is that this wasn't even placed on one transaction...they charged me the larger sum several days later!! Never using capital bike share again...
Fred G,"Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA",5,05/18/2015,Fun way to get around DC!,"These are awesome bikes. I'd say better maintained than when I had my own bike - because unlike my bike - these bikes get proper maintenance work done by bike professionals constantly. Looking up your route in advance or on a smartphone can help, especially if your destination might have a full rack. I hope the BikeShare expands with more stations and DC gets even better biking infrastructure."
Knohanz,"New York City, New York",5,05/08/2015,Perfect way to see the sites in DC,"As there is no metro coverage in the mall and other memorial site areas a must is to rent bikes--there are rental spots all over town where you pay one first price then can ride for 30 minutes at no extra charge--works great to just keep swapping them out as you go from site to site along the mall and around town. We used it back to hotel as well. Kids do fine on them. Very sturdy if a bit heavy bikes but most of DC fairly flat so no big deal. We did not have helmets and had no prob with that. We used bikes for a couple days working through the memorials etc, then used Metro for longer hops on different days. The bike stations really are all over the place so assuming you have a map or smart phone it is quite easy to hit them before your 30 minutes runs out or don't sweat it if you miss as the price is not much. Service is good if you have a technical glitch--just call and they can reset or tell you what to do. 2 bikes per credit card so families need more than one card."
92mikaela,,1,05/04/2015,WARNING - worst scam ever,I purchased a one day permit for renting a bike on two separate days. At the terminal the small screen showed 138 pages of terms of condition difficult to read and somewhere in this text the Company claims the bike has to be docked every 30 min to avoid a late fee. I didn't see it or maybe the sun blocked my view at the scren. This has resulted in a late fee of 94 dollars per day as I rented a bike 2 separate days. I rented in the morning and biked around for 5-6 hrs. My receipts clearly states the use is for more than 30 min and paid for 24 hrs use and NOT that I HAVE to dock every 30 min. My 2 day bike rental amounted to 202 dollars and I am shocked this Company still can get away with it. I will definately contact the Tourist Authorities and warn (hopefully put pressure) about this company's business methods.
Wil N,"New York City, New York",1,04/29/2015,Scam,"Horrible experience. Very disappointing. The ads at the kiosk makes you believe they only charge $7 a day. We rented 2 bikes for 3 hours and ended up with $80 credit card charge. The rental agreement on the tiny LED screen is totally misleading. If the service program was backed by the government, then it's the shame of the governmentDON NOT SWIPE YOUR CREDIT CARD!!!"
Kimberly64,"San Diego, California",5,04/22/2015,Nice ride,"This is a great idea! We walked around our first afternoon here and by the time we got back to our lodging we were bushed.Today we decided to go w/a 3 day membership and take these bikes around the Capitol......... Easier on the legs and I love to bike, so even better! You can leave the bike at any of the many Capitol Bike stands, go into a museum, then come out and rent it again for just a few bucks.... Like I said...... Great Idea! "
Victoria P,"Reno, Nevada",5,04/21/2015,Cheap Easy Way to Travel. Give your tired feet a break!,"Pros: I love this program. You can rent up to 2 bikes per credit card. Pick up at one location and drop off at any other location (which there are a lot of around DC). It was a lifesaver for us today. We were able to see all of the Tidal Basin, Monuments, and most of the National Mall this afternoon, after the museums closed (at 5 p.m.). They come with a little bell that you can ring and people will move over for you; and a carry area in the front that you can place your stuff in. You get a code after you pay that you type in and unlock the bike. Then, when you're done, you just shove it back into place and wait for the green light....and you're done.A 1 Day, 3 Day, Month, & Year passes are available. The first 30 min are free then there is a fee after that. All the fee information can be found at: https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/Con: Helmets are not available to rent. No bike locks available. *** This is much better than some of the other rental options (like Bike & Roll DC) which charge much more; and have more stringent return requirements (like your bike has to be returned by 6 pm when they close)."
Crue1,,3,04/20/2015,Not a scam-Read the pricing web page.,"As I said, this is not a scam. All the reviewers saying this is a scam must have misunderstood, or ignored the pricing guidelines on the website. The pricing can be a bit tricky to follow, and they definitely try to hide the fact that there is a deposit per bike of about $100, but it's there, you just need to read, and you will see it.The bikes were in good shape, the pricing is good, and there were plenty of bikes, and bike docks around the city. I am only taking a point off because my wife and I did run across a bike dock that was full, and we found no simple directions to redeem an extra 15 minutes for finding another bike dock, as stated in the website, so we ended up going into the next half hour because of this.The other star I'm taking off is for the complete lack of either a mobile app, or least somewhat mobile-friendly site. The station map on the Capital Bikeshare website is darn near impossible to use on a smart phone!! The map squishes up into a tiny little part of the screen that is very difficult to use.Overall, it was a good experience."
John G G,"Denver, Colorado",5,04/19/2015,Best $7 you'll spend in DC!,"If you want to view as many monuments as possible in a day you best bet is to rent a bike from Capital Bikeshare. We wife and I had only a half day to spend in the mall. We took the bikes and we able to get great pictures of the Capital, Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, the Whitehouse and still had time to go to the Smithsonian before it closed."
Demostenes S,"Harrison, New Jersey",1,04/14/2015,stay away from this thiefs!!!!!!,"we rented two bikes for 7 dollars an hour, and they charge my credit car with $94 dollars late fee for 2 hours later,   They make you think is cheap but the trick is lletting you take it for half hour free ."
Nyormirror,"Bay City, Michigan",5,04/11/2015,Best thing we did in DC to save time/Money/Energy!!!! A Must!!!!,"My son and I did a 3 day member rental at $15pp after we walked 10miles in one day and were exhausted. Your 1st 1/2 hour is free each time you rent a bike and then it is about $2 pp. for each 1/2 hr. after that. All you do to avoid the extra fee is ride less than 1/2 hour, dock the bike then re-rent. You get another fresh free 1/2 hour. According to the Bike share website 96% of DC members don't go over a 1/2 hr. ride. They have bike share stations all over the tourist area, the mall, downtown, Chinatown, etc. You can even rent them in Arlington. I would definitely recommend using the spot cycle app or capital bike share app because it lets you know how many bikes are available (or not available) at each station and where the stations are at. They are 3 speed, wide tire, wide seat mountain bikes with quick release seats and front and back automatic lights. DC's bike routes and paths are very easy to access and work great to avoid all the crowds walking on the sidewalks. I would highly recommend this to a family with teens and would definitely do this again when I return to DC."
AVLwriter,"Asheville, NC",4,04/05/2015,Ride around the National Mall and see all the monuments!,"This is a great idea: Bikes can be rented from any of numerous stands, and then returned to any stand when you are finished. It is a very easy process: Pay with a credit card, take out a bike, and then return it. We rented three 3-speed bikes with good sized, comfortable, adjustable seats that were in fine condition. It is a perfect way to get around to see all of the monuments without having to walk.There are two downsides, however, so be prepared. One is unavoidable: the crowds. You will likely have to weave your way through plenty of people, most of whom seem oblivious to bikes. Thankfully, they ""kind of"" move aside when they hear the bell, which is thoughtfully provided on each bike. Second, be very aware of the pricing. The company claims that the first 30 minutes is ""free,"" but that isn't really the case, since you have to pay a ""daily membership"" fee plus fees for each half hour. A two hour rental cost $20, and you can easily eat up two hours just riding around the Mall.Still, this is a wonderful alternative to walking and it is especially welcome on a sunny warm day!"
Dawn371,"San Jose, California",5,04/02/2015,Convenient and fun,Save your feet while touring DC! We'd been here a few days and our feet were tired. We found out about Capital Bikeshare and decided to give it a try. We bought the 24-hour membership and it worked great. We took out bikes 3 different times during the day to go between attractions around the mall. The system worked well. The bikes were comfortable and in good repair. Will use this again.

fidel c,"No Name Key, Florida",3,10/28/2014,"Nice to ride, but can't drop it off","Too often I found stations that were full, some was unable to return my bike.

15travelingwithteens,"Benton, KY",2,10/27/2014,Love/Hate relationship!,The bikes were amazing. Wish you could have had more time to ride though. They were helpful to get around on. Sometimes there weren't enough bikes or parking places so you either wouldn't get a bike or you would get charged extra. During the morning many computers had low batteries so you couldn't rent. After walking to 2 stations that wouldn't work I called and our 24 hours was extended for free...hopefully...haven't gotten the credit card bill yet. The app is crucial to finding out how many bikes are available in a certain location. We ended up near the White House with no bikes available in the area so had to take the metro back to Union Station.
George G,,1,10/15/2014,Ripped OFF Read The Rules OR PAy$$$$$$,So 5 of us rented 5 bikes in DC read the rules as $7 a day rode to half a dozen sites returned the the bikes near our hotel 3-4 hours later one month has passed called to ask why $106 charge on my card for 2 of the bikes (you can only put 2 on a card so other people in party had same charges) and they responded by saying $7 per day for 1/2 hour trips for 24 hour period overtime charges will apply after 30 min. I got charged $46 overtime & $7 per bike for 3-4 hours of sight seeing. If I was aware up front maybe I would have still rented it but non of the 5 of us realized the conditions. I feel ripped off hoodwinked they got us for $230 overtime charges on 5 bikes for less than half day.
Danielle S,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5,09/14/2014,Great way to be quick! ,We only had a little time so we rented the bikes. We just wanted to see as much as we could. They saved so much walking! They were fun also. There are docking stations everywhere. I read on the reviews there is an app. I would recommend it. Can be a little hard finding the stations. We just did it today so I don't have any info on the money hold. I think it's worth it though!!! They could put a little more info on the signs so your not figuring it out on screen where you pay. They also may want to add another pay station at the busier ones!
Don F,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",1,09/11/2014,Idiots Among US,"DON'T DO IT!!! Minimal cost if 7$ for 30min and your card gets charged a deposit fee of 101$ which stays on your card for up to 3 days. Customer Service does not exist, even for MEMBERS.

We had researched Capital City Bike Tours and knew the drill re the 30 minute 'free' period.We loved the freedom on the bikes and saved our legs, enabling us to cover a lot more ground. A couple of fishhooks that other travellers should be aware of. We visited 4 bike hire stands in Georgetown before we found some with spaces ( there were 4 of us) eventually we had to split up and return two while the others biked off to find another.) it was so hot we were very tetchy and over it by the time we did eventually get rid of our bikes and caught a taxi back to Foggy Bottom after dinner.The next day we picked up bikes again from Foggy Bottom and had planned to visit Arlington Cemeterey, when we arrived we were told no bikes in the cemetery and so we split up- two watched the bikes and two of us made a very quick visit, then we swopped over. Either Capital Bikes need a bike stand there or don't plan to visit by bikes . We got stung $22US when we eventually dropped the bikes back. To make matters worse , we couldn't get a second bike , to bike back to Foggy Bottom, the machine kept saying we had had the maximum (two per credit card) we think perhaps the person before us who had a problem with his bike hire may have got our ticket ??? anyway we walked back to our hotel. I hope the people at Capital Bikes take note of both our problems and perhaps are able to rectify for other clients . It is great service and I would use again but probably not to Georgetown in the weekend as due to no metro in the area the bikes are well used and racks all full. They do have a service which allows you an extra 15 minutes and tells you where there are spaces but by the time we biked there they were all taken. We didn't mind paying an extra $2 for the second half hour but we were just over 2 hours for the hire to Arlington and that was $22 each which was a bit steep for the students in our group."
Trevor B,"Brooklyn, New York, United States",1,08/20/2014,Awful Customer Service,"I signed up for a year-long membership on August 1st. At the time, the website said there was a key shortage, but they would be back in stock at the end of July, so I didn't think anything of it. They also had a ShopHouse promotion going on in August that I was excited about.Flash forward to today, August 20th. Still no key. Still no free ShopHouse. I called them, explained my frustration, and asked what the status was. They told me it would be another 7-10 days.Keep in mind, I received no updates from them for the past three weeks.I had no intention to cancel my membership, but after the phone call full of excuses and being told I needed to patiently wait my turn, I realized I wanted no part of Capital Bikeshare. They held onto $75 of my money for a month without any service or updates to me. That's unacceptable.Capital Bikeshare is a great idea. I hope to be a member once they get their act together."
50statesbid,"Detroit, Michigan",4,08/18/2014,a great service,"my first time-and I will do it again.  Finding the return racks when you are pressed for time is nerve wracking, but once you get the hang of it-it's a great way to see so many sites in this hot, crowded city."
colleend24,"Manchester, New Hampshire",4,08/17/2014,"so worth it, for tired kids touring the mall","This was a fun way to see the Mall and monuments. After walking for a few hours on the mall and seeing many monuments, we broke down and decided to rent some bikes to go see the Jefferson and FDR memorial, as we knew they were much further away and we were running low on energy. The only reason I do not give 5 stars is the $100 deposit per bike put on your credit card for about 10 days. The actual cost was about $20 per bike for a few hours; very worth while, though. This was the highlight for my ten year old son, thinking it was the coolest thing ever to ride from memorial to monument, and ringing the bell yelling ""on your left!"" Great family memory."
alicoc,Keller TX,5,08/11/2014,Use the app Spotcycle and you can bike around DC for $7 a day!,"You can get these bike for $7 a day as long as follow the directions, which is dock them every 30 min! This is not hard as there are docks all around the city and one by every main point of interest you can think of. Use the app Spotcycle! It's free and will tell you where every docking station is, how many bikes are there and how many open docks. We only used these for 1 day but it saved our feet! We could get to the monument or museum we wanted, dock the bike, spend as much time as we wanted walking around then get a bike and ride to the next place. The app was a lifesaver and it wouldn't have been as good of an experience if we didn't have it. It even has a timer for you :) "
cwhich05,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5,08/10/2014,A MUST!,"Washington, DC, is sprawling and hoofing it can take a toll. You can choose the bus tours, but they can't hold a candle to seeing the sites on a bike! Download the APP to see what location is closest to you to either pick up or drop it off. They have many convenient locations! BIG TIP: either bring with or purchase a bike lock so you can lock your rental just steps away from where you'd like to get off and tour on foot. We had a bit of a search to find a lock, so my new purchase will be a permanent travel companion because these bike rentals are popping up all over major US cities! This is a very economical, time saving and fun way to tour DC for any age! We felt totally safe enjoying the sidewalks and obeying the traffic lights!!!"
RV1994,"Los Angeles, California",5,08/03/2014,A must to get around DC,"We are so glad we decided to try it. You can bike from one station to the next (under 30 mins) dock and restart a new trip. If you've never been to DC, the maps make things look like they are in close proximity to each other, but they are pretty far apart. Your feet will be thanking you."
Muneeb S,,1,07/14/2014,DO NOT hire these bikes,"We rented 2 bikes for 3 hours and ended up paying $90. Not to forget that they charge a deposit of $102 for each bike. (Which I have not received back and it has been a month). Have called multiple times on their customer service number but they are useless. It's cheaper to buy a bike from Walmart than to rent these extremely expensive, over priced bikes. The pricing on their website is not detailed at all and certainly not explained on the bike stations. Beware of the charges. Unless you are a millionaire."
James C,"Clive, United States",1,07/09/2014,Don't Think You Can Rent a Bike for $7 a day,"Don't believe that you will get a bicycle for a day for $7. We rode two bicycles around to the monuments for 3 hours and were billed $90.00. The explanation was that the $14 charge was for a one day subscription and because we did not check the bicycles into a rack every 30 minutes we incurred overage charges of $38.00 per bicycle. Taxis would have been cheaper.The bikes were good and serviceable, but the charges are exorbitant."
merrillma,"Tulsa, Oklahoma",5,06/28/2014,Best way to get around,"Totally worth the 15 bucks. We found these bikes very handy in getting around from site to site. There are so many stops to park them. We rode them to the hotel from the ballpark, there was a rack right outside both places. Traffic was very friendly to the us. They were so easy to use and have a basket for bags or purses.We loved them, very cheap transportation."
highschoolteacherMO,"Ballwin, Missouri",4,06/21/2014,Bikeshare and families,"We were in DC for a week and after walking all day our first two days we decided to do something different. We read the reviews for Bikeshare which was very helpful. We only bought a 3-day pass and for $28 for this family of four you can't beat it. I would highly recommend getting the bikeshare app, otherwise as a tourist you would be lost. I would also NOT recommend making your first tour use of this service for exploring the monuments at night. We, of course, did this and it's difficult to find the docking stations at night when you have a 30 minute window. Except for our run from the Archives Metro station to the Jefferson Memorial, this was an excellent way to see DC (our first run was too long for us since we were unfamiliar with the process and we almost didn't make it in the 30 minute time frame). Pros and Cons:Pro: If you want to have an easy way to get between memorials/sites and you don't want to have to worry about bringing a bike lock, this is perfect.Pro: Bikes were in good shape, easy to use (and to change seat height) and docking stations were convenientCon: You can only check out two bikes with one credit card, so it was a little time consuming to check the bikes out each time (had to use two credit cards and click though some questions).Con: Really this might just be for us, but we didn't bring helmets so we had to bike without themPro: Bike paths are very accessible and take you everywhere you'd want to go.Con: At night, we accidentally rode into the FDR memorial (thought we were still on path), the ranger was very polite in asking us to get off our bikes (we just felt terrible)Con: We wish the time frame was more like 45 minutes to an hour, but that might change the whole purpose of the bikeshare programAgain for a family of four (daughters 14 and 12), this was a great option. If we did it again, we'd go for the 3-day pass."
566alliej,"Redwood City, California",5,06/19/2014,Best way to see DC,"This is hands down the best way to see DC. We bought a 3-day pass, and it was well worth the $15. Once you pay your membership fee, any trip under 30 minutes is free, with additional fees applying after your half-hour is up. We would often take the Metro to one area of DC, check out bikes, and check them in again whenever we wanted to stop and take in a sight. This saved us the extra fees and the hassle of needing to find a safe place to leave your bike. My biggest tip is to download the Spotcycle app, which lets you see which racks have bikes and open stations. It saved us a ton of time, especially when we were exploring the memorials and tidal basin area."
margarita d,,1,06/13/2014,Importante tienen desconectado el telefono y los email no lo reaponden necesito mi dinero URGENTE please.,"Their telephone is disconnect. I need my money back from the hold,The amount is $202. PLEASE...Call me. I haven't receive a response to my email. Att Eliud"
LetsMaketheMostofIt,jackson ms,5,06/11/2014,Fun day ride,"We rented bikes to go up and down King St in Alexandria. This was a really fun, reasonable way to see things up close and personal! i personally didn't feel the need to swap out every 30 minutes to avoid paying extra, although I'd certainly check them in if I was not actively riding to avoid excess costs. The hold on the debit card did not last the stated up to 10 days and was off the account with in 3 or 4 days. Fun way to explore, get some exercise, and see things a new way."
Holman B,"Jackson, Mississippi",5,06/10/2014,Most Efficient Way to See DC,"Capital BikeShare is the best way to get around. There are stations pretty much anywhere you would want to leave the bike. It is a great deal! Only $15 per bike for 3 days. You can pick them up and drop them off whenever, wherever, and how ever many times you want. There is a $2 fee if you use the bikes for more than 30 minutes, but to get from one place to the next, this is not a problem. There was a station right across the street from our hotel, which was perfect. As for me, I know if I tried to walk all over DC, I would get tired real quick and that would slow me down. This way, you can ride to wherever you need to go, with no trouble. I highly suggest taking advantage of the Capital BikeShare if you would like to see DC in the most efficient and enjoyable way!"
Cindy P,"Seabeck, Washington",5,06/10/2014,Energy Saver!,"These bikes are absolutely amazing! We got the three day membership for $15 dollars and have been using the bikes all day, every day! We ride for 25 minutes then find the nearest docking station and switch bikes to avoid any charges, it's working perfect.Reviewers that say it's misleading are completely at fault, not the company. The signs are very straight forward and tell you exactly what to do. If you want to ride a bike all over the city for one day you pay a $7 membership fee PLUS any additional time beyond 30 minutes. Their intention is to get people from point A to point B only, not to keep a bike all day. After you pay the membership fee, it's free to take a bike for 30 minutes, after that you pay $2 for 31-60 minutes, $6 for 61-90 minutes and then $8 for each additional 30 minutes! Yes, they are actually penalizing you for keeping a bike all day and rewarding you for returning a bike after 30 minutes! Just go from dock to dock like we did and it's all free (except for the membership fee). Who in their right mind thinks they can rent a bike for 24 hours (or more) for $7??There are tons of docking places throughout the city and you can very easily find a dock within the free 30 minutes. Dock your bike then get a new code and un-dock the same bike, it's that easy! We have been all over from Capitol Hill to Dupont Circle to Georgetown to Arlington and have only had to pay the initial membership fee! Sweet deal!I highly recommend the bikes, don't hesitate, just follow the simple guidelines and you'll see more monuments and sites than you can imagine. You'll also do it way cheaper than the metro or cabs and you get to stay in total control of stopping and restarting. A real benefit is the wind blowing through your hair on a hot day - something you don't get when walking!"
yvonne p,"El Sobrante, California",4,06/06/2014,Get a bike and tour,"We only had a day to get around the mall. Seemed that every bike rental place = you had to take a tour, and one location. Bikeshare locations are everywhere. There's the initial fee, and hourly rates added on. We were told that the trick is to turn it in every half hour to save the extra fees. But, we were having too much fun riding them around, and stopping to see the monuments to worry about the fees. We did have a problem at 'check out'. My husband requested 2 bikes, but only one would unlock. Make sure you dock it back in correctly. Easy to follow on-line information."
BikegoddessJulie,"Chicago, Illinois",4,06/04/2014,Capital Bikes makes it (kind of) easy to visit great sites,"I was in Washington D.C. this past week and decided to utilize their bike share program. To be fair, I am from Chicago and a member of the Divvy program which is run the same way so my familiarity with the system is high. I ended up explaining how the program worked to someone who was looking quizzically at the instructions on one station.Things to know:*You can buy a 24 hour or 3 day pass*This pass is good for unlimited use in that time frame however, you must redock your bike every 30 minutes in order to not be charged excess usage fees*You swipe a credit card to get started following the onscreen instructions*You will receive a 5 digit code which you can use to unlock any of the bikes at the station*Be aware that if a bike needs servicing, the seat may be turned around to show that it should not be selected*I suggest you set your seat height, numbered for future rental use, and any bags in the open sided basket before you enter the code to remove the bike*To remove the bike you may have to lift the rear of the bike to angle it out of its dock*Get on, make sure the bike work, watch for traffic and roll*Redock your bike, go back to the kiosk and reswipe your credit card to get a new release code to take a bike back out. The wait time to redock and get a new bike is about 30 seconds I believe. Use the same credit cardI highly recommend you download the free app SpotLab which will show you the location of other docks and offers a timer.I rode over to the National Mall and had a great time riding around, however I found that there was a surprising limitation of bike docks where I thought there should have been. There were no docks by the Vietnam Memorial and you cannot/should not bring your bike into any of the monuments anyway.There are a decent amount of bike lanes in DC that I would recommend riders use.The app said there was one open dock by the Lincoln Memorial, however when I got there and rechecked, there were in reality no open docks. I think there was an issue reading one of the bikes. I reswiped the previously used credit card to request 15 more minutes to try and find another open dock.I also used the bike to ride around various neighborhoods on my way back to DuPont circle area. It was a great way to see some of the homes, offices, consulates and was very enjoyable. However, always be a careful rider and obey your signals and stop signs. Nothing ruins a day more than ending up splat on the hood of a car, especially if you blew the right of way."
L A,Idaho,5,06/01/2014,"Save your feet, rent a bike","After one day of walking the national mall, we were coveting the bike riders. They are easy to rent and easy to ride. We were able to see so much more by bike. Cost is reasonable too. Only downside is after docking them, there is a chance you won't get one again in that location."
E W,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5,05/30/2014,Best way to commute or tour DC!,"For just a few dollars a day, ($7) getting around DC can be a breeze! Just be sure to re-dock your bike within 30 minutes, and simply pull out a new one--otherwise you'll incur some steep fees. Download the Spotcycle app to locate the 100s of docks where you can pick out and return a bike. There is a great rack on the front with ample room and a stretch chord to secure your items. The seats are easily adjustable with a quick release tab, and the bikes are comfortable and easy to handle. Have fun!"
mcmcBill,"Brussels, Belgium",4,05/30/2014,Nice way to see all sights around The Mall at own pace,"Initially I had thought we would buy tickets for a hop on hop off bus tour, but given their inflated prices and time required, we decided to create our own program around The Mall with bicycle and use public transport for the longer distances. Registering at a rental station was not as easy as explained, some cards were not liked even though advertised as accepted. Some better/updated explanation panels are needed.Had fun cycling around. If you time it right, you can make use of the first free 30 minutes of use (after paying the $7 day membership) and swap bikes before your paid minutes start counting.Nice way of getting around and seeing the sights and getting to know a large area in a short time. On The Mall and surrounding streets you are allowed to cycle on the sidewalk by exception."
herd_of_6,"Cedar Rapids, Iowa",5,05/28/2014,"Save your legs, rent a bike for the day!","We spent five days in DC sightseeing and 10 plus miles a day on concrete is hard on the legs. Our last day there we decided to do the capital bikeshare and what a wonderful way to see the city! I see some reviews about the site being misleading, it's not, you just need to read the instructions. They spell it out very clearly. NEED TO KNOW ABOUT RENTAL:If you read their website and understand how it works you'll be happy.* There are a few different options, getting a key or getting a code. Since we just rented one day so we did the code. Each time you want a bike you swipe the CC you reserved the bike on and it will print you out a code. You can choose a bike and go. * Understand the pricing structure. For the daily rental it was a $7.00 base charge. Each time you unlock a bike you get the first 30 minutes free and then an additional rate is charged for each section of time. Example: We rented and rode to the National Cathedral (and got lost) so it took us longer than 30 minutes, think it was about 55 minutes, we had an additional $2.00 charge for that specific trip since it took us 55 vs 30 minutes. The rest of the day we rented five more times (back to the mall and didn't get lost, around the tidal basin, up the mall and a few other stops in between) and there was no additional charges since we kept each trip to under 30 minutes. Over all we put on 28 miles and paid $9.00 for the day which I think it really reasonable.*There are bike racks all over the city, there's a great app to tell you how many bikes are available and how many slots are open. The BIKES:These are NOT commuter bikes, and they were a far cry from the road bike I am use to. They are heavy, there are only three speeds and they are built for ALL body types. I wouldn't plan on riding one out to Mt. Vernon by any means. But they are great around the city and mall and for stents under 10 miles. The bikes we had were all in good condition and were comfortable. They also do not come with helmets. If you stick to the trails it's not a bid deal, but riding up to the Cathedral was a little hair-raising in DC traffic. If your planning ahead pack a helmet. Great to see a program like this, very user friendly and a great way to see the sites."
TJ SA R,"Johannesburg, South Africa",5,05/26/2014,Great way to see the city!!!,This is a must do if you like the outdoors! Stations are conveniently stationed around the city. Convenient setup and 3 day rental a good deal. Bikes are well maintained and there were always bikes available. DC has great biking trails and lanes all around. Enjoy it! 
Sistersonatrip,"Commerce, Texas",4,05/10/2014,sightseeing while saving your feet ,Kind of complicated at first! 24 hour pass is $7 only if you return within 30 minute intervals. Basically rent it. Ride somewhere you want to go or just for 20 minutes. Return it at next station. If you want a long ride return it at a station within 30 minutes and grab another one as soon as you return the other! Best way to travel the mall and see Jefferson! 
katemackenz,"Oshawa, Canada",1,05/05/2014,Misleading Company Charges More than Expected,"Like many others here I experienced the misleading nature and false advertising offered by Capital Bikeshare in Washington. It leads you to believe you will be paying $7 for 24hrs which seems very fair and reasonable. This is not the case and I was charged over $20 for 2 hours only. This is very disappointing, as no one renting these bikes would have read through every single agreement written on those small screens before renting their bikes. It is unfair and this company is taking advantage of the fact that tourists would rent the bikes without reading each and every single page of agreements. In Canada I would be reporting this business to the Better Business Bureau as I say they are operating a scam and are relying on those individuals who would not fight to get their money back."
ronpoole,"Riverdale, New York",5,04/30/2014,Easy and fun,"Bikes are in excellent condition, stations are in convenient locations, and DC is more bike friendly than it used to be!"
Vandy K,,5,04/30/2014,Best way to see the sights,"So convenient, with stalls abundant through out town. A little pricey, but so worth it! Your feet will thank you! The Jefferson Memorial is a long way out there folks! Note that you can only rent 2 bikes per credit card and they dont accept American Express. But check out the informative website for pricing and map of all the many places to return your bikes at the end of a long and exciting day. We returned at Union Station, went in to see the beautiful train station, had dinner and then took the night tour to see it all lit up! I've done the mall many times, and this is definitely the way to go. It's flat easy riding, the traffic is mainly pedestrian, and no crowded buses to deal with! "
Travel_Bug81,"Waterloo, Canada",5,04/23/2014,Easiest Way to Get Around and Very Affordable,"The Capitol Bikeshare in Washington is one of the best that I've experienced. There are tons of stations around the city, and it's super easy to get around. It also helps that there are many bike trails and bike lanes, so there are designated spots for bikers. The city is very bike friendly because the population is mostly young and 40% of the people don't own cars. This means that the cars are also well aware of bikers and are used to them on the road, which helps.The way it works is this:1. Get a membership. It's $7/day or $15/3 days or more for longer periods (you can get a yearly or monthly membership also I believe)2. Use your credit card at any of the bike stations in the machines provided to buy the membership of your required length3. Once you buy the membership, you will get a 5 digit code. Use this code to enter on the little pad beside each bike. Once the light turns green, pull out your bike (sometimes have to use two hands)4. The membership allows you unlimited use of the bikes in (and this is the important part) - 30 minute intervals. This means that you will have no additional charges if you return the bike to another station within 30 minutes. The city is small enough that most places can be reached within the 30 minute limit. The point of this is to allow other people to use the bikes as well, and the bikes are meant as a form of getting from point A to point B, not keeping the bikes for the entire day (although you can do this, but you may end up paying hundreds of dollars, like the poor chap that called the service a scam below. It's not a scam - you just have to read the instructions properly. You are charged for every additional hour you don't return the bike). If you don't think you'll make it in time to your desired station, you may stop at another station and request additional time. You do this by inserting your credit card, and pressing the 'renew' button. This allows you an extra 15 minutes to get to the next station that is closest to your destination, or if the station you wanted is full and there is no space to leave the bike.5. If you require the bike for longer than 30 minutes, you may return to the station, wait 5 minutes (or walk to the next station) and get another bike, repeating the process above. The five digit code you get the first time will only be active for 5 minutes from the time you get it. Every time you want a new bike, you'll have to get a new code by inserting your credit card into the machine. Your credit card will not get charged again - it's only used to determine that you've already purchased a membership and to get a new code.6. Returning the bike, make sure you push it in hard into the stand, and make sure the green light comes on - this means the bike is locked back in.. 7. For those that have smart phones, you can download the Capital bike app (available on their website or from the app store) that will give you real-time information about how many bikes are available at each station or how many free spaces are available, so you don't have to waste time looking for the next available station if the one you want is full, or doesn't have bikes. It's also handy because it gives you the locations of all stations.There are many stations around the city and it's very easy to use and get around. In the three days that we rode around, there was only one instance where the station was full and we had to find the next one (5 minutes away - press the 'renew' button to get more time). Since we didn't have data services, we didn't have the real-time information for which stations were full/empty, but we could still see the station locations. We found that biking was more convenient and cheaper than the metro because there are more bike stations than there are metro stations, so it was easier to get closer to our desired destinations. Not to mention being able to get a better look at the city, and get some exercise.If you use the service properly, you'll have a great experience."
artsands,"Denver, Colorado",1,04/21/2014,Scam,"We were led to believe the bikes would be $7 per day if we didn't exceed 8 hours. This company is a total scam and they tried to charge us $276 for the use of 2 bikes for 2 days. Their fee schedule is ludicrous, very poorly shown at the stations, misleading, and nothing but a scam! Go to a regular bike shop and rent a decent bike with helmets provided, etc. Read the other negative reviews that explain how these folks were taken in."

sdrewry,"San Antonio, Texas",5,04/09/2014,Great way to see the city!,These bikes are GREAT! Such a fun way to tour around. Biking on the mall at night seeing the monuments was one of my favorite things we did in DC! The call center is very helpful if there is a problem. Be sure and download the app so you can check available bikes and docks near you. It is a great app! NOTE: Be sure and put the key fob on a key chain or zipped in a pocket. Mine accidentally came out when I grabbed my phone from my pocket :-(
Bret B,,5,02/03/2014,Excellent bikeshare system,"Washington DC has it's issues, but the ability to get around without a car is possibly its best amenity.Capital Bikeshare is what every city thinking of instituting a bike program should emulate.With a membership, you get as many 30 minute rides as you like. And if yu use it alot, it makes sense to pay for the keyfob. No swiping credit cards at the kiosk; just insert the keyfob and the bike unlocks from the rack. Quick and easy.And they have kiosks everywhere!!"
DrewLuck,"Alpharetta, Georgia",5,01/01/2014,Best way to see the city...,"We rented bikes in DC on our recent trip. It was so easy to set up and we saw the whole city in a fraction of the time as it would take walking or riding the metro. Do yourself a favor and grab a bike when you are in DC. You can practically ride them anywhere (sidewalks, streets, parks), but don't ride them into the memorials/monuments, just walk them up or pop them on a bike stand. There are stands EVERYWHERE. They have apps that will show you where they all area and how many bikes are available at each one. The app we used was Spotcycle."
RPK89,"Melbourne, Australia",4,12/14/2013,A wonderful way to see the Capital...,"When we arrived in DC, with very little planned for our day trip from NYC, we had no idea where to start, but right out the front of union station I spotted these little babies and off we went. It is just like the 'Citi Bikes' bike share system in NYC, and I love both equally as much. It was a great way for us to see every along the national mall (I was ignorant to the sheer size of the place), and thankfully there was bike ports almost everywhere. We also tested the friendship (half hr free rule) by riding into Georgetown, and lucky for us we made it. It is a great way to see the Capital, and an entertaining one at that.I would highly recommend it!"
yyyzzz_utah,"Murray, Utah",5,11/10/2013,"Rode a lot, convenient, but rules not clear","I rode a lot this time I visited DC. Very convenient. It is better than using taxi or driving cars around town. There are many stations around town. And the number is growing day by day. Some minor gripes. It is not always easy to find the stations at night even if you have a map. There is no options for kids. Some bikes needs maintenance. I wish there is a clock on the bike telling how much time you have spent, since it charges fees for a ride over 30 mins. I wish there is a way to get safety helmets. Pretty good. Highly recommended."
0471sip,Tampa,5,11/06/2013,Great time!,BIke racks were everywhere. So easy to hop on and off. Machines were easy to use. Phone app for stations is fantastic. Can't recommend enough!
SandcruiserX,"San Francisco, California",5,11/01/2013,fun way to see more on the Mall,"inexpensive, easy, much more fun than walking.what would take hours to stroll on the Mall can be seen much more quickly on two wheels.it's a great thing for both tourists and locals, alike.the free smartphone app is an easy way to find stands to check-out or return a bike. do budget in a little extra time in case the stand you choose is full, that nearly happened to me as I was returning to Union Station. No harm done."
vanilla g,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",4,10/24/2013,An alternative way to see DC!,"I have been in DC for nearly a year and I never tried the red bikes yet until last weekend. I always see people going around with those red bikes and I pass by the bike stands every day on my way to work. So we (my boyfriend) rented 2 bikes for more than 4 hours and we paid $42 ($7 each for daily membership fee, the first 30 minutes is free, $2 per hour onwards). DC is a bike friendly place with dedicated bike lanes in most areas. You can pedal your way in the sidewalks too and the people respectfully give way to you.Compared to walking from one site to another, biking is way better! And it is more beautiful and magical at night! You can return the bikes anywhere as long as there is an available stand to accommodate your bike. As we returned them and had dinner in Chinatown, we were able to get them back (since we already paid the $7 day membership) and continued with our sight seeing.You pay using your card and it has been a week since, I believe it is well secured for using cards.It was a very fun and exciting experience and I'm set to being a biking tour guide when I have friends coming over to the nation's capital."
Tallmark1960,"Lynnwood, Washington",5,10/19/2013,The Best way to get around DC,"For $7 per 24 hours you can check at a 3 speed bicycle from one of dozens of bike stands located through out the downtown. Return the bicycle to another stand within 30 minutes and you avoid further charges. Exceed the 30 minutes and they charge you an ever increasing surcharge. ($ 2 for 31 to 60 minutes, 4 or 6$ if you exceed 1 hour, etc.) While it was a bit of a hassle finding a bicycle station at times that was a small price to pay to avoid additional blisters on my feet. Bicycling is the only way to get around the city."
mrod27,"San Antonio, Texas",4,10/18/2013,Bike the Sites!,Capital Bikeshare is the only way to see DC! Metros are crowded and you miss all the sites. Renting a bike is a great way to quickly navigate the streets of DC. WABA! (Where A Bike At?) is a free app that can point you to the nearest station with availibility. We purchased a 3 day pass for $15. There are usage fees if you keep the bike for more than 30 minutes but its very easy to avoid this charge by checking the bike in at the nearest stand every 30 minutes. Usage fees start at $2 an hour. Still a deal IMO. I suggest renting a bike at night to tour all the Monuments while they are lit up at night. This is a great experience minus the crowds.
SarahElizabethSch,"Charlottesville, Virginia, United States",5,10/12/2013,The ONLY way to do D.C.,"Forget crazy traffic and crazier traffic patterns--the ONLY way to see DC is with this bikeshare. My husband and I (who both grew up in DC), recently came back for a wedding and stayed in Rosslyn. Rather than deal with the headache of driving/parking/paying to park, we decided to bike over the bridge and spend the day hopping the attractions. The bikeshare made it simple and easy--the stations are everywhere!"
AAARGH_OH,MAYFIELD HEIGHTS,5,09/28/2013,BEST way to get around DC!,"So I was standing on the Mall near the Washington Monument with sore shins and feet from walking so much. I wanted to get to the Lincoln Memorial, but was dreading the walk. Then I see a row of similar bikes on locked racks. I see that I can sign up for 24-hour period for $7 and use a bike for free (no usage fee) for up to 30 minutes (30 - 60 add $2, 60 - 90 add $6). So I grabbed a bike and leisurely rode down the mall to the Lincoln Memorial, stopping at the WWII and Vietnam memorials. I returned the bike to the closest rack and moved on.After that I grabbed another bike off the same rack, looked at the map of rack locations all around the mall AND Washington DC, made my plan of where to go to next, then proceeded to tour the rest of the mall area. No walking needed.This service is fantastic. I saw MANY people using it and it makes perfect sense! No wasting time walking between distant attractions.By the way, the bikes are HEAVY three speed units not meant for any kind of speed. They are intended for leisurely use."
jeff_and_kayla,"Spokane Valley, Washington",4,09/25/2013,Tough finding docking stations without a Smart phone,"My wife and I made our first visit to D.C. the weekend following Labor Day for half a week and used Capital Bikeshare one day to get from our hotel at Dupont Circle to the National Mall. From the Mall, we headed off on the bikes to a lunch venue, then back to some Smithsonian museums, then around the Mall some more, and finally to a Metro station to head back to the hotel.The directions at each station are clear cut. Rental for the day is $7. Rental for 3 days is $15. You've got the use of the bikes for a 24 hour period if you rent for the day like we did. Every 30 minutes you must re-dock your bike at another station if you want to avoid additional fees, $2 for the next 30 minutes (31-60 minutes), $4 more dollars for the next 30 minutes (61-90) minutes. Payment options are credit or debit only. After docking your bike for the first time and ready to check another one out for another 30 minutes, you simply re-scan your credit/debit card at the pay station and follow the directions to retrieve your unlock code which is valid for 5 minutes. You don't get dinged each time you slide your card.You can dock a bike at a station and immediately check another one out too. There are docking stations all over the place, but a few times we couldn't find a station that was indicated on the online or station map, and many times we passed by stations that weren't on the maps at all. When I speak of these maps, I'm talking about the website and the ones at the pay/docking stations. There are no hard copy maps available. Since we don't have phones with internet capabilities, we felt lost on more than one occasion searching for another docking station. Reading other reviews, it sounds like their app is very helpful. However, we were always able to find another station within the allotted 30 minutes. A 45 minute allotment of time would be much better and leave the rider feeling much less rushed. If planning on using them to tour the memorials at the National Mall, you'll be very rushed or will have to skip stuff, dock the bike, and backtrack on foot. There's a station by the Washington Monument, one by the Jefferson Memorial, and one by the Lincoln Memorial on the west side of the mall where all of the memorials are.My wife had trouble with her seat staying put on a couple of occasions so make sure you grab a bike that has a seat that locks down tight. After sunset, we rode around the National Mall to see everything again, and that was great. The flashing LED headlights don't provide a ton of light however. The lights, I believe, are mostly there as a safety measure for you to be seen by others. There are other bike rental companies in town that offer usage for the entire day if that's what you're looking for. My wife used similar bikes in Boulder, CO earlier this year and had a bit friendlier experience than here in D.C. We'd certainly try these again, but would make sure we upgraded to a smart phone next time to make life considerably easier."
K D,"Bethesda, Maryland",4,09/18/2013,Very Good Site Seeing Option for DC,"My experience was overall good. Once we actually had the bikes, it was an easy 2 hour site seeing ride through DC. The simple 3 gear options worked perfectly for tough hills. **Issues**1.) The first issue is the touch screen machine needed to be re-calibrated due to it taking almost 30 minutes to enter in my information due to the wrong number showing each time I pressed one. For example, I kept pressing number ""5"", but ""6"" would show up. It was very annoying. Other than that.......GREAT EXPERIENCE !!!"
Cassie-Andy,"Wellington, New Zealand",5,08/29/2013,Fantastic way to get around.,"Whoever came up with this idea is simply genius! Great way to get around the city, we had a bus tour and used these for the 2 days we were in town and it worked a treat. so much faster than walking and the breeze is nice too. I would recommend downloading the app so you can get live updates on how many bikes are at each station and where the closest station is. The app also has a rental timer to help return the bike within 30 mins to avoid rental charges.READ THE BOARD BEFORE RENTING!!! I have read a few reviews on here of people getting confused with the pricing and thinking they could keep the bike for the whole day for $7. It is not hard to understand and my husband and I found it very clear in the fact that the rental was $7 for 24 hours and during that 24 hrs if you returned bike within 30 mins it was free, and then it had the charges for if you returned after the 30 mins. simple! there are so many bike stations around that it was so easy to re dock the bikes within the 30 mins period, we never went over our time period and were not inconvenienced by having to re dock the bikes. Occasionaly we docked and re docked straight away to avoid charges if we were planning on riding a bit further."
Thomas M,"Split, Croatia",5,08/21/2013,Brilliant way to get around DC,Myself and my girlfriend were in DC in April 2013 and used these bikes. It's a fabulous way to get around to all the main sites and I would highly recommend it as it is far better than a bus and there is a lot of ground to cover on foot if you are only there for a short stay like us.
ClemclemB,"Montreal, Canada",4,08/11/2013,Very nice on Summer,"The capital bikeshare are very practical if you like to feel the ambiance of the city. It's better than subway, first because it is very less expensive and also because your outside while travelling between monuments.
We enjoy very much our day pass !"
BraintreeTravelers2,"Braintree, Massachusetts",5,08/04/2013,Best way to get around the city!,"We have used these very accessible modes of transportation to enhance our sightseeing experience in the downtown and extended areas of DC. My husband discovered this unique, cost effective, ""enjoy at your own pace"" way to travel around the city during the busy Inauguration and again when we visited the city in the Spring! We were able to go places and experience sights that we would not have seen from a car. It was a totally amazing riding directly down the center of Pennsylvania Avenue, from the White House to Capitol Hill, since they had removed the traffic lights in preparation for the Inauguration. We explored the National Mall and Smithsonian Museums, the Washington Monument, Reflecting Pool, Lincoln Memorial, around the Tidal Basin with its many meaningful monuments, to the Jefferson Memorial. In the Spring, we explored the Arlington National Cemetery. It is easy to use the pick-up and drop-off kiosks, with many stations a short distance from one another. The bikes have three speeds and are simple to maneuver. I highly recommend giving this a try, because I am not a cyclist and had so much fun each time."
duffa101,Oxford,4,07/30/2013,A good way to get around - but don't expect to find a bike every time.,"First off: hats off to any city that's doing its bit to promote this kind of transport system. Washington's heart is certainly in the right place. $7 for a day of travel around the sights of the National Mall and further afield to Arlington and Georgetown is certainly good value. To clarify: you have 30 minute window to get your bike docked into another station, not the 90 as one review has it, though you do get a 'safety' 15 minutes if you find all of the stations full when you reach your destination. Given that the metro is $2.70 a ride (when including the paper card) you can save yourself some money and sore feet with the bike.The bikes are simply and easy to ride, and you can get a reasonable shunt going if you're so inclined, though I'm not sure why you'd want to unless you're a DC commuter heading into work, and then why are you reading this?Here's the health warning: there are lots of tourists and bikes can become a premium in certain places (the Lincoln Memorial for example) so you can't expect to rock up and find one. The app is good, but doesn't update strictly in real time: by the time you reach the station the bikes might be gone. Some people are quite canny at dropping a bike then swiping for another 30 minutes, so pairs of bikes are sometimes hard to come by.Personally, I wouldn't plan a day around using a bike, especially if you have are under time pressure to get back somewhere, but if you can afford to be a bit more relaxed this might be a fun, and useful, bonus attraction."
MJB13,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",5,07/30/2013,Greatest thing ever,"Couldn't be a better way to explore DC. Download the Capital Bikeshare app for $1.99 or, even better, SpotCycle app for free. You can see where you are and find locations of CB bikes. There's even a timer so you can stop < 30 minutes. Best to carry your own helmet on a daypack. Simply brilliant!"
Elizabeth A,"Atlanta, Georgia",5,07/08/2013,The best way to get around town!,This is the best concept - excellent way to get around DC. You pay a flat fee for a day ($7) or three days ($15) then short trips (less than 90 min) are free. You simply check bikes in and out of conveniently located bike stations. DC is very bike friendly city just check your routes as there is a lot of construction around the city and rising with kids could be dicey. We found this to be FAR superior to walking the city! And there is an app available that shows you maps and bike stations - AWESOME! Every city should have this system.
TheCeccos3,"Allen, Texas",5,06/19/2013,Best way to see DC - EVER!,"I can't tell you how much we enjoyed using Capital Bikeshare! It was so convenient and so much fun. What a great way to tour the city. We found them near every single place we wanted to visit! You pick up the bike at one of their many kiosks, drive it to your destination, drop the bike at the kiosk and then pick up a new bike when you are ready to move on to your next destination. Please pay attention to their fees though. I saw that some people who reviewed them on tripadvisor were not aware of the way they charge, so they ended up paying way more than they thought. This is more of a form of transportation from one place to another, not a way to tour around the city for the day. It is $7 for the day and you can have each bike for 1/2 hour at a time. Additional time is charged after that first 1/2 hour."
Zach S,"Orlando, Florida, United States",2,06/13/2013,Great potential but falls short,"Experience for the first hour was great. We understood the requirements to return bikes to station within 30 minutes to avoid any charges other than initial 1 day membership cost. However, when ""system"" reported that bike was not returned (at all) after I had returned it within 30 minutes, it became my word against the report out of their ""system"". There is nothing that consumer gets to prove that you've returned their $1,000 bike properly. Customer service couldn't do anything for me because all I could tell them was that I saw a green light when I returned bike to the rack. Luckily ""system"" reported bike returned in a few hours so did not have to argue a $1,000 replacement bike charge."
Adrienne H,"Brooklyn, New York",1,06/11/2013,Scam. You will be charged a lot more then they specify!,An unspecified charge will appear on your card. Renter be warned. 2hours is $75.00. And there will not be a phone number to call about these extravagant charges because their customer service phone does not work properly. Please avoid being doped by this government backed racket.
Bluesboy10,,3,05/31/2013,"Warning for cost of $10/hour for Bike, even if buy ""membership"" !","Warning needed for cost of Capital Bike Share. As a tourist I loved the use of a bike. BUT confusing pricing. A quick look at it, along with my daughter who lives there looking at it, and past experience of anything else, you think you either pay something like $2 per thirty minutes OR get the $7 per day. But it should be summarized as : "" $7 to register to get 30 minutes free ONLY if you dock it for at least one minute, then restart; you, must pay $2 every 30 minutes and re-dock every 30 min ; registration “membership” last 24 hours; warning- failure to re-dock it every 30 minutes can cost $10 per hour ! See confusing pricing table below."""
CG902,"Morristown, New Jersey",5,05/27/2013,Best way to get around!!!,"Our 12 year old son bugged us all day to get bikes around the Mall near Capitol. We finally gave in on day 2! Little did we know how brilliant he was! We got 4 bikes and were off! We sailed around monuments and thousands of motorcycles with the Rolling Thunder Ralley. We rode for hours and covered more ground than we could have in a week! Best of all, we returned bikes right next to hotel as there are racks all over the city! Best $24 spent on trip!"
michaelruns,"New York City, New York",5,05/13/2013,See the District for $7!,"A terrific deal, when one understands that you have 30 minutes to get to another bike rack. We made terrific use of the system and got to see all the major sights in a matter of hours. Highly recommended, and looking forward to NYC getting this system soon!"
Elizabeth E,"Chicago, Illinois",5,04/25/2013,Take a ride around DC,"for $7 you have DC at your disposal. A great way to cover a lot of ground, get to quieter corners and get exercise. I took a bike out early in the morning and biked instead of a treadmill in the hotel ""gym"" The route I chose passed: Viet Nam Vet memorial, MLK memorial, FDR memorial, Jefferson Memorial and Lincoln Memorial. What an inspiring way to begin a day. With 150 pick-up/drop-off spots, you can get anywhere on these bikes! Have fun, take a spin."
HoDoJo111,"Sandwich, Massachusetts",1,04/22/2013,Scam,This company is nothing short of a scam. Intentionally misleading about their rates. Thought we were renting 3 bikes for 3 hours for $21 ($7 per bike per day) Instead we were charged $160 on our credit card. Went to their website and read the fine print - something very difficult to do on the small LED screen (27 pages) at the rental KIOSK. The KIOSK advertises Bike Rental's for 24/hours - $7. Shame on them.
Ted T,"Sandwich, Massachusetts",1,04/22/2013,SCAM!!!!!!!,"IF YOU READ THE 127 PAGES OF FINE PRINT, and understand it, you will realize that the very simple sign on the point of sale station that clearly says $7 for 24hours, means something totally different!the company clearly intends to benefit from leading people astray.we were charged $161 for using bikes that we thought would cost $21."
Jay P,"Columbus, Ohio",5,04/22/2013,One the best things I have ever done in a city--EVER!,"This is such a super cool way to get around and bike racks are everyone.  LOVED IT!  Bikes were nice and new, and I want to own one of them!"
DebRed_10,"Melbourne, Australia",4,04/19/2013,A quick fun way to get around Washington DC,"We spent most of the day using the Bikeshare and had such a good time. You collect the bike at a station for $7 for a day and that's all it costs unless you return the bike late. Every 30 mins you need to find another 'bike station' to leave the bike at, go and walk around in that area, then go back to the bike station and take another one. You must return the bike every 30 mins or you will be charged an additional $2 or an additional $6 if you return within an hour. It was a great way to get around quickly as Washington is a big place, but trying to find a bus station became an issue a few times. We didn't have a map as we didn't have access to a computer, so we had to stop and ask a few times. Beware that 30 mins on the bike goes very fast and you may find yourself a long way away from another 'station'. Having a map should stop that from happening. The whole day cost us $9 each which was a huge saving compared with the hop on hop off bus etc. Would recommend this."
vwgirl,Jersey,5,04/08/2013,Think of it as a taxi or a metro for $7/day,"I see that some people are confused by the fee. If you want to keep a bike all day long, this is not for you. If you want to use a bike as a means of transportation, this is a great option!!! You really can see a lot of the city that way, you just have to give up your bike for few minutes. Go explore, walk around, take some pictures, visit a museum, eat and then get on a bike again (maybe even the same bike you left few minutes ago :) and bike for up to 30 minutes to your next destination."
superfly777,Michigan,4,04/08/2013,"Excellent program, need more stations","We liked the bikeshare program. I just wish there were more stations to rent/return the bikes.The program is really simple. $15 gets you a 3-day membership and there is no charge if you return the bike within 30 minutes. Just $2 if you keep it for an extra 30 minutes.My son is 11 and he could ride the bikes with no problem. The national mall is all bike-friendly. The bike lane down Pennsylvania Avenue is well worth it. You are riding right in the CENTER of the road but the cars aren't in your way. Sounds weird, but it really works nice. Take a bike ride from the Capitol to the White House. Just wish there were more stations near the Capitol itself.I'd highly recommend using bikes to get around DC. Your feet will thank you."
Sharon F,"Seguin, Texas",5,04/04/2013,Quite a Ride!,"This is the way to go if you want to see the monuments and give your aching feet a break! We rented bikes on a beautiful, sunny day and we were so glad we did! We quickly saw all the major monuments - bike rental for a day was only $7. I would highly recommend this!"
jacqjacq,"Innisfil, Canada",5,04/02/2013,Awesome way to see the monuments!,"This service was FABULOUS! We wanted to do the bike thing at our leisure and didn't want to be committed to opening hours for a bike rental shop. Capital Bikeshare has an option for one day membership and the rates were reasonable. There are stations everywhere - and with their iPhone app you can check to see where bikes are available and where return points are. Note that I emailed Capital Bikeshare to get information not covered on their website FAQ and no one ever got back to me - but in the end we didn't need the info anyway.We chose to do a night ride through the mall. The bikes had lights that were suitable given the lighting available in the surrounding - but you might want to bring a flashlight or headlight if you choose to do a night ride. We kept the bikes longer than we expected - but the rate was no different than had we rented from a shop but we had flexibility. A note to one-day renters. You can get 2 bikes with one credit card - but if you need more than 2 bikes you need a DIFFERENT credit card and they only take Mastercard and Visa. Also - the bike security hold fee stayed on both my credit cards for about 5 days (I know this is not in Capital Bikeshare's control - but worth noting). The bikes have little baskets with a bungee that hold items fairly securely. The bikes are utilitarian and not meant for a comfy beach cruise or a cross-country tour - so be prepared for a hard ride. The bikes were in great shape and easily adjustable to our different heights.Note that if you do a mall ride at night - the mall can be quite busy even at night. We found that people were shocked to see bikes near the monuments and some thought it was a great idea and others told us that people should only walk to the monuments (and no we weren't pulling jumps off of Lincoln or anything like that, and we walked the bikes when we got to the monuments) - in any case the bikes seemed to garner a lot of attention.This was my husband's favourite part of our trip.And remember your helmet!"
frankiejulia,"Sedona, Arizona",5,03/21/2013,Every city should have a Capital Bikeshare,"Capital Bikeshare is a wonderful addition to DC. The service is affordable and accessible. The bikes can be picked up and returned almost anywhere in central DC. I rented a bike several times over the days I was in DC and rode from my hotel to the National Gallery, to the mall, and to the Lincoln Memorial at night. DC is an easy city to navigate by bike. It's mostly flat. Yet on foot, the distances between museums and monuments can feel long and tiring. The bikes from Capital Bikeshare are perfect. If you're at all inclined to ride bikes, look for Capital Bikeshare next time you're in DC."
linny1605,"Melbourne, Australia",5,02/17/2013,Great way to see Washington DC!,"We had so much fun riding the bikes from monument to monuments. It's definitely a time saver, and not only that, riding at your own pace means we could enjoy the sights and cover all the things we wanted to see. The bikes are easy to rent, just use your credit card, and it's so convenient to dock the bikes for return. We rode on footpaths, through the gardens and went from the White House to the Washington Monument, up the Reflecting Pool to the Lincoln Memorial, then along the river to Jefferson Memorial before heading to Capitol Hill. We docked the bikes outside the Smithsonian Castle then made our way by foot to the see the Natural History museum. Weather was bit cool and it started to snow during the afternoon but what a blast we had! Bikes felt very safe and it's very easy to ride with a few simple gears that you can change to help you ride up or downhill. No helmets provided and it's one of the rare chances you take to feel the wind in your hair!"
detraveler_7,"Philadelphia, PA",5,12/02/2012,What a timesaver,This is the second trip to DC when I used the bikes. The first I was close to the Mall and I rode all around the central area. The most recent time I was near DuPont Circle and rode down the trail along the parkway to the Mall. Both were excellent. I could not have covered as much ground on foot. This is a great option for tourists. The kiosks are well located for sightseeing.
Erik R,Toronto,5,11/13/2012,Awesome way to see the city,"Forget about long tiring walks- one sure fire fun way to see the monuments and the interesting neighborhoods of DC is by bike - and Capital Bikeshare is definitely tops! Bikes are plenty and available at key strategic points all over. My buddy and I purchased day pass for USD 7 and we are allowed unlimited 30 minute use within 24 hours. It was fun. Biking to see the impressive monuments, putting back the bikes in the racks, and picking them back again to go to another location. "
Anita C,"San Francisco, California",5,09/24/2012,an excellent system,"Due to a Metro delay, I found myself running very late to meet friends for dinner. Not wanting to spring for a cab (and realizing that it would not be any faster than walking, due to rush-hour traffic), I decided to give Bikeshare a try. Amazingly, you can join right at the kiosk if you want a 1-day or 3-day membership. I got to dinner on time -- there was a drop-off pod a block from the restaurant -- and got a little exercise, too. I liked it so much I used it again later that night to get back across town when I wasn't near a Metro stop, and then again the following day to get down the National Mall when I decided the weather was too hot to walk so far in direct sun. Each time I easily found nearby bike pods using the Spotcycle iPhone app, and there was always at least a couple of bikes waiting for me in my preferred pickup spot, and plenty of return spaces near my destination (although you get an extra 15 minutes free if you try to return to a pod that's full).Your membership gets you free rides up to 30 minutes in length, with increasing hour rates the longer you keep the bike. (I took a total of 5 rides and none of them were longer than 30 minutes, so I paid only the $7 daily fee.) Then, each time you use the same credit card, the systems recognize you as an existing member.Riding on the street in rush-hour is not for the fainthearted, although you're allowed to ride on the sidewalk outside of the downtown core, and a few dedicated ""bike boulevards"" on major streets (there are maps online of both). I wish we had bikeshare in my city -- it's a great way to get around this mostly-flat city."
bittentwice,"Brooklyn, New York",2,09/19/2012,THEIR BIKES ARE A SAFETY HAZARD,"City bikes is a very convenient service, they're located all over the DC metro area and have countless stations, where most of the time you can get a bike without too much hassle. The price increased somewhat since my last visit, and at $7 for a day plus charges for trips exceeding 30 mins (when their bicycles are really slow) is a bit steep. Visibility on the little LCD displays where you pay and get a code so you can unlock your bicycle is marginal at best, and under direct sunlight almost impossible to read.That being said, their bicycles are HORRIBLE. They have 3 speeds: slow, slower and barely moving, and steering is severely impaired. This makes for a very unsafe bicycle when you're moving in the middle of traffic. I don't know the statistics, but am almost surprised I didn't get into an accident while riding their clunker through DC streets. And I'm basically a bike commuter, not an athlete or a messenger. Keep that in mind if you decide to use the service."
aavv8r,"Baton Rouge, Louisiana",5,09/12/2012,Great way to see the sights!!!,"We stayed in Alexandria, Va and used these bikes for 2 days several hours a day for a total of $7/day. You can't beat that! We rode all around Alexandria and then took the Mount Vernon trail along the water from Old Town to by Reagan airport to Crystal city. You can rent and return as much as you want, you just have to limit each ride to 30 minutes or you incur an additional charge. The Spotcycle app is a must! It shows you all the stations and how many bikes and slots are available in real time. Highly recommended!"
Moondogge,"Orlando, FL",5,09/04/2012,Best Decision of Our Trip,"My wife and I spent 5 days in DC in August and have been there many times in the past. This time we had set out expecting to walk and use the metro for all of our travel needs, until we saw the Capital Bike Share program. What a great service! We paid for the 3 day membership and used the bikes almost exclusively during our entire trip. Very economical and a great way to see DC and still save time. I highly recommend using this program if you are on vacation and are going from sight to sight."
lydthompson,"Pasadena, California",5,09/03/2012,See the monuments at night at your own pace!,"I highly recommend seeing all the monuments at night by bike. Capital Rideshare has bike stations all over DC. Their website tells you where they are (125 throughout the city) Its almost a bike vending machine. We rented them near the mall, took our time seeing all the monuments (at night they are beautiful), and then rode them back to a bike station near our B&B and returned them there. Great, inexpensive way to see DC."
causemark,"Toronto, Canada",4,08/26/2012,Great way to get around cheaply in DC,"I've use this kind of bike share system in Europe but I'm happy to see it's been brought to DC which is such a great city to get around - NOT in a car. There are so many great sights in DC that you almost want to walk...but then that's a bit slow. So, put your credit card, in one of the hundred or so Capital Bikeshare stations, follow the instructions, and for a mere $7/day, you can bike the city. Pick up a bike in one spot and drop it off in another. To make it ever easier, be sure to download the the Spotcycle iPhone App so you know where the bike stations are, and even if there are bikes there at that moment."
mrskrae,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",4,08/19/2012,Meant for short fun rides-if doing it for recreational,"My husband & I decided it was a pretty day & we wanted to spend a day outside. We decided to rent the little ""red bikes"". I have been in the DMV area for less than a year & we currently do not own our own bikes, so we saw that Capital Bikeshare had the most docks & that the website actually shows you how many are available at each dock. What the website does not tell you--which I can is being misleading--is the fact that it's $7 for the first 30 mins, but there are additional fees for the extra time & there is a $101 deposit per bike...for us, it wasn't a big deal...we originally planned to go from 10th & constitution to Georgetown, but after we saw the price, we decided to change our ride to around the national mall & see the MLK memorial. We never had intentions on biking all day, so the 1.5 hours was perfect for us & still an inexpensive, fun way to tour DC. Definitely not meant for long rides. Would do it again...We plan to buy bikes but until then, Capital Bikeshare works for us!"
Lindsay L,"Boston, Massachusetts",1,08/16/2012,SCAM,We thought this was a great way to explore the city for just 7$ a day. To our surprise once we received out credit card bill we realized that this was not the case. The membership fee for the day is 7 dollars and then you are charged for every minute you have the bike. This can get expensive fast. It is not made clear as to what the exact cost is for these bike rentals. Would not recommend this to anyone.
Nancy S,"Miami Lakes, Florida",1,08/06/2012,Return the bikes often to avoid High $$ Charge (if you can),"Here is the deal, this program can be a little confusing the bikes are mostly located in the downtown area with some outlying such as Georgetown. You pay a membership fee which does not include usage. Usage charges add up if you do not return the bikes with 30 minutes, good luck trying to find an empty dock where to put the bike in popular area. You are probably better off renting from a bike shop as at least you will know how much you will pay, otherwise you may pay well over $100 a day if you do not return frequently."
bcanovas,Miami,1,08/04/2012,Very Confusing High Credit Card Charge!,"I though what a great program bike rentals conveniently located for $7 dollars a day, every community should have this. I carefully read the instructions and thought I had to return the bikes (2) before the 24 hours elapsed, which I did. I noticed a hold for a couple of hundred dollars which is understandable. But to my horror the money was deducted from my account because the bikes have to be returned every 30 minutes? This is not what I understood, I have requested a refund and will update when/if I get one..... :-("
Shoshonechic,,5,07/05/2012,So glad for a bike! Would do it again in a heartbeat!,"On the morning on our first day in DC, I pulled a muscle in my foot while running downstairs to catch the Metro, missed it anyways! Capital bike share saved me from having a hard day exploring the city. It was a hot day in the city, the bikes were a fun way to get everywhere quickly, easily, and without getting too tired out. As we whizzed by hot, tired, and miserable people of all ages I felt sorry for those who were walking especially the kids whose heads would turn longly. The wind blew in our sweaty faces and kept us a little cooler than the masses. My foot was fine, no pain, no swelling thanks to the bike rentals. It was convenient and fun. I would do it again in a heart beat!"
rachelbaddorf,"Memphis, Tennessee",5,06/15/2012,"Flexible, cheap and fun","We saw these red bikes everywhere and asked our waitress at Founding Farmers. She raved about them. With stations all over the city, its a great way to get around on the cheap."

pathopa,"London, United Kingdom",5,04/15/2019,Must do when in Chicago!,"We loved renting these bikes! It super simple, you dont even need to sign up for it. Use the bikes to ride up and down the lake, its fantastic."
Manchoduque,,1,03/08/2019,Dissapointed,"Very disappointed with Divvy Bikes and Brenda in their customer service department, rented two bikes during my trip to Chicago, returned both bikes when I was done, for X or Y reason one of them didn’t register in; now I gotta spend my time disputing a $140 charge for 18hrs of a bike I didn’t use. They can see in their system where I returned them and times, I think these bikes even have GPS. Would love to know if anyone else has gone thru a similar experience?"
pjain1906,,1,02/25/2019,Dishonest company.. Terrible customer service,"Had one of the worst customer service experience with this company. After coordinating with the company via email and phone multiple times for over a month for issuing key, I am back to square 1. Learnt that either the form was not filled, or it got lost..How on the earth the form can get lost if you received 5 phone calls and 2 emails?on top of that you are not even accommodating and apologetic?SHAME"
rjatrix2018,"Chicago, Illinois",5,02/12/2019,"Practical, eco-friendly transportation","Awesome to be able to use bikes throughout this beautiful city. This is a good way to get to know the city, go to its neighborhoods, exercise, commute and more.,"
Carson S,,2,01/23/2019,Service has gone way down. Not reliable anymore.,Ive been a member for a couple years now and I will not be renewing my membership. The system has consistently went down hill. It has become very unreliable. From stations not having any bikes to get or stations being full all around and nowhere to dock your bike. Then I have had issues with stations locking a bike in but turning red and then my key gets shut off and you have to call and they had to get someone out to get the bike before my key could be turned back on. Or the multiple times that stations just aren't working for some reason. It just isn't a reliable way to get around the city anymore.
Raoul P,Kuwait,4,12/23/2018,Very very very convenient,Bike sharing in Chicago is a good way to see Chicago as well as get from point A to point B. Divvy bikes makes that experience even better as they have a very simple and easy to use solution.
Jordan M,,1,11/12/2018,Charged $150 dollars for a 30 minute ride,"I was charged $150 dollars for an incorrectly docked bike (that I infact returned). I recall bringing my bike back to the location that I got it from just outside of the United center and docking the bike. I was told by the help desk that despite that the other bike I had rented had been returned within the allotted timeframe, the other bike was not an therefore went undocked for 2 days resulting in a $150 charge. They do not have GPS on the bikes so therefore could not verify that it was in fact in the same exact location for that time. I will never use these bikes again and stick with the more reliably supported infrastructure of public transportation or Uber."
AS20180,"Chicago, Illinois",1,10/29/2018,Divvy system malfunction & I was charged for 40 hours of ride time,"The Divvy system does not accurately track bike docking. I used a 30 minute pass and docked the bike within that time period. It was my first time using the bike so I waited for the light to turn green showing it was docked. Fast forward a day and a half, I get an email letting me know that I am being charged for 40 HOURS of ride time ($140!). I called the customer service line to let them know there must be a mistake. Customer service was not understanding at all and would only refund 50% due to ""User Error"". I asked what else I should have done as a user to make sure the bike was docked and the representative told me to wait for the green light. When I explained that I did wait for the green light, the representative told me I was not correct because their system did not show a green light. Now I am out $70 through no fault of my own with no good faith full refund or credit from Divvy's customer service. As a first time user of this product, this is no way to build a customer base. Very disappointed in this company- would not recommend."
214natalieb,"Sandwich, Illinois",4,10/08/2018,Way more fine than I thought.,The machines are pain in the butt and you only have 5 minutes to put the codes in to get the bikes unlocked. You also cannot rent more than 4 per credit card. But the are nice bikes with convenient return sites. What a great way to explore Chicago and the Lake!
jenniferbenitez,"Siloam Springs, Arkansas",5,09/24/2018,Very fun and convenient! ,We had a great time with these bikes. You get some beautiful views. They are plenty of stations to park around downtown. This was our first time in the city and it was much cheaper than constant Ubering.
LydiaBrasil,"Sao Paulo, SP",1,09/16/2018,Only for americans! What a disapointment!,Divvy Bikes is a service only for american people. They don’t accept non US credit cards nor give an alternative. They simply ignore the foreign turists. What a disapointment!
Hasti S,,3,09/12/2018,Not bad but still needs work,"So I got my first Divvy bike with a 30 mins pass to get to university. The bike was not bad I just had to adjust the height of the seat. Some people said that the bikes are heavy and it is hard to ride them. Well they are not entirely wrong. The bike was heavier than usual and it only had 3 gears so you could not go very fast with it, but I cannot say that it was very hard to ride, it was ok.I got my pass via the Divvy mobile app. You can download it from app store and google play. I am going to be honest with you, the app officially sucks! After refreshing and reseting multiple times I was able to get to the page that gives the pass. After paying the fee the app gives you a code that you enter on the keyboard next to your chosen bike and the dock releases it for you. Then a timer appears on the app that counts your riding time. You can also buy passes at the station but I should warn you that they do only accept credit cards (no debit cards or gift cards).There is a map on the app that shows you where is each station and how many bikes and empty docks it has. When you wanna get a bike you touch the plan a ride button on the app. Since it is 3$ for only 30 minutes you have to be careful and plan your ride ahead and make sure there are empty docks at your destination. When you wanna return the bike you just have to take it to an empty dock and push the bike forward until the dock grabs it. Then a green light appears that means the bike is successfully attached. Be careful if you do not put back the bike correctly you could be charged for a very long time. To make sure, you can refresh the app and the timer on top of it disappears. To sum up, I think that this is a good service that still needs work, but if you are looking for a healthy and cheap way to get around I definitely recommend it."
Robert S,"Hyde Park, Vermont",3,09/11/2018,"A good idea, with some minor issues","While in town visiting for the weekend, we rented two bikes so that we could ride with our hosts. There are many locations, in popular spots, so pretty convenient for us. One can rent with just a credit card, or by using the app, while creating an account, which is easy.The first rental went fine, although checking the bikes in was questionable, as the kiosk was offline when we went to rent again. While on hold to report the issue, a technician arrived and rebooted the kiosk. We were then able to take bikes out. The bikes are comfortable, and very sturdy (also heavy), but with three speeds they were fine for the bike path near Lake Shore Drive. Overall a pretty good service."
CordeliaGray,"Portland, Oregon",4,09/06/2018,Great experience,"We paid for a day use and then rode along the lake in the morning. We had some other plans for the afternoon, but came back and rode down the lake that evening because we had enjoyed it so much. It was really a ton of fun. There are plenty of stations to pick up and return bikes. Price was good. Only complaint was that the bikes needed a bit of work."
ratsoc5150,,3,08/31/2018,"Great idea, needs fine tuning","I want to really like this service. The idea is fantastic and I'm sure the teams involved worked very hard to implement this. Let me start by saying that the bike I rode was smooth, the experience of riding in Chicago was both exhilarating and satisfying. I highly recommend giving it a try and I hope they remain in service for a long time to come. Today was the first day that I attempted to buy a pass and ride a bike. I bought my pass using the app, located the nearest dock, followed the process of keying in the code to unlock the bike, the lights first turned orange and then green. I put my hand on the handle bar to pull it off the dock and it stayed put. No matter what I tried I could not take the bike off the dock. I realized that the bike never unlocked for whatever be the reason. I looked the FAQs in the app, there is nothing there about troubleshooting unlocking a bike (code correct but dock didn't disengage lock) I called their call center and was on hold for 10 minutes, in the end I did not get to speak with anyone. The app displays the unlock code only once, I could not use the code to unlock a different bike. You are made to provide your phone number and email address however the code is neither emailed to you nor texted. Neither could I purchase another pass. It was all very frustrating, the app just displayed the time elapsed, calories, start point end point. I headed to the kiosk and purchased another pass with the intention of appealing for a refund at a later time. With the new code in hand I successfully unlocked a bike and tried to key in my destination in the Divvy app in order to point to the closest dock to my destination. Lo and behold there was a button at the bottom of the map ""Unlock Bike"" I don't know whether I'll be able to use the loaded pass for my return trip but I will try and see. I wont need a refund if it works. There needs to be better instruction, troubleshooting, the user experience of the app definitely needs a little more thought and improvement. Will I rent another Divvy? Absolutely and so should you!"
Gabriela D,,4,08/27/2018,Divvy is a wonderful resource in Chicago,"Divvy is a wonderful resource in Chicago, not only for tourists but also for residents who use this system as a way to go to work and to transit the city in an eco-friendly manner. As a resident, I seem to remember that you now can use it each time for 45 minutes (instead of the traditional 30 minutes per ride). Is that true? I do not want to assume that and incur in non-desired extra charges."
Heather_B_4074,"Leesburg, Indiana",5,08/25/2018,Best way to see the city,"We stayed for a night in the city for my bday. We biked everywhere super convenient and lots of fun. Reasonably priced and the divvy returns were everywhere in the city. 
A few of the bikes needed maintenance but overall in good shape."
693mandys,"Orange City, Florida",5,08/21/2018,Great way to travel the city,I had never done one of these before but just loved it. Was able to get around the city quickly and safely. Loved going on the bike trails. There are parking stations all over the city and it is a 24-hour service so I could take it out at night and come back. Much better than calling an uber or taking public transit. The bikes were very comfortable and even had 3 gears to change for maneuvering some of the hills. The stations were easy to return the bikes and get out a new one. Highly recommend.
MichaelMiMichael,"Chicago, Illinois",5,08/14/2018,Divvy bike riding is fun in Chicago summer!,One of the most fun things to do in Chicago in the summer.   Highly recommended!  Definitely try out the lake shore path!  :)
katiek886,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5,08/03/2018,Do this!,"Even if you are going on a mile long walk from the loop to the pier, rent a bike. It's worth it. The kids loved it and so did the grown ups!You can see quite a bit of Chicago in a shorter period of time, relatively cheaper than a lyft."
theburg,"Hattiesburg, Mississippi",5,08/02/2018,Best way around Downtown,Got a bike at Navy Pier and wish I had found them earlier.  Lots of fun (on the quieter streets) and a great way to get from place to place without the slowness of walking.
honestly14,"Cleveland, Ohio",3,07/29/2018,PLEASE READ THIS FIRST if you have a large group,"Ok, I had 15 people in our group. You can only take 4 bikes out under one credit card. So you will have to use multiple credit cards if you have more than4 to rent.Also, use the divvy locator app to find stations close to where you are and how many bikes are there. So when you want to turn them back in you have to find a station with enough empty spots. Kind of a challenge with a large group. And we had problems at the first station because there were two defective bikes that we couldn’t release from the stand. I ended up calling the customer service line three times and visiting two stands before getting all the bikes. The touch screen at the kiosk was hard to use (screen couldn’t read our button pressing). And once you pay and get the code to release the bikes you only have 5 minutes before it expires. Some would take the code right away and some you had to enter several times before accepting. If you go past 5 minutes you have to re-dock all the bikes and start all over. AND if you plan on taking a nice leisurely bike ride on the Lakeshore Trail, forget about it. There are way too many people that apparently are training for the Tour de France or something because they are flying around at top speeds, yelling at you if you aren’t accommodating them. I had 13 year olds and even though it said you had to be 16, they were fine on these bikes. Easy to ride even though they are well-broken in at this point. Great idea and value but you may need lots of patience."
Leon B,"London, United Kingdom",2,07/27/2018,No good for overseas tourists,"My wife and I were looking forward to using the Divvy bikes along the lakeside in Chicago. I downloaded the Divvy App on my phone having first checked it would be possible to hire two bikes using the same debit card. We successfully secured the first bike however when I tried to unlock the second bike I was presented with a message saying I couldn’t have a bike at this time. After numerous attempts we tried to use the kiosk but the payment was rejected. I used three Visa cards including an American Express Card. All were rejected.Eventually, I called a number that we found on the App (the telephone number shown on the Kiosk was alpha numerical so would not work in my phone). I’m sorry to say the gentleman I spoke to after a very long wait was super dumb. I explained very clearly and on numerous occasions what I had done but he was unable to think of a solution other than putting the one bike we had successfully hired back into the docking station and starting all over again (I tried this without success). Eventually after 15 minutes I suggested we try a different docking station and rang off. The next docking station was manned by a young women. We explained our problem and she said she did not know why the app would not work for the second bike. She did however say that the kiosks do not accept cards issued from abroad. Can you believe it! When it comes to payment processing the US has always been behind other parts of the world (e.g. chip and pin).She kindly offered us the second bike free of charge. A good solution for now but not for later on in the day or on future days unless we bumped into her again. I have to assume hiring two bikes on one card cannot be done with an international card. We had a great time cycling on the lakeside. We cycled for many miles in a very safe (car free) and beautiful environment. Come on Chicago. We’re not all American you know. You should be trying harder to encourage more tourists to your beautiful city."
Double D,"Lee's Summit, Missouri",5,07/22/2018,Lakeshore ride,User friendly with easy access from place to place. We rented 4 bikes and did a mid morning ride along Lakeshore Drive in Chi Town. We were able to stop along the route to eat and socialize before returning the bikes. Great way to get around on a trip and there are various bike racks throughout the area if you need to end your ride or that a break and do something else. 
Katherine A,,2,07/19/2018,Not good,"I wanted to get a bike to ride to lunch on my break. I spent most of my break trying to unlock every single available bike and it wouldn’t release. I had already been charged and tried to call and email customer support and never heard back. I ended up having to uber (spending more money and time). Will not be trying ever again!!! It’s only $3 so it’s not a huge deal, it was more of an inconvenience for me. Also, I have done these bikes in other states and had no problem."
traveleravonlake,"Avon Lake, OH",3,06/26/2018,Customer Service,Be sure to push the bike in all the way when docking it. My husband rented the bike for 1 hour but we ended up getting charged $79.21. We are new to the whole bike sharing thing as it is not available where we live. When I called they offered 50% refund but I pushed a little harder. They said they would credit the whole amount. I told them to refund all but the 1 hour. I hope they mean what they said. Will wait to see if the credit comes through. Great way to get around Chicago but the payment/process seems hard to understand. Good customer service if credit comes through.
Carolinem064,"Pittsford, New York",5,06/17/2018,Loved these bikes! Easy and convenient!,"We loved these bikes and found them very easy to use. It was a very hot day and after attending a craft fair we didn’t want to walk any further. A bike ride along the lake seemed like a relief from the heat! On a whim we purchased the 24 hr pass! We were hooked! In those 24 hours we ended up seeing much more of the city than we intended! We rode to Lincoln Park, Wrigley Field, the Bean, Zoo, Navy Pier, Willis Tower, Field House, Art Institute, Soldier Field and several museums. The bike paths were easy to navigate, we saved on transportation and as a bonus had a mini workout!The paths were pretty level and the bikes have gears to help the small inclines we encountered. A few days later when we had to get to our boat ride at the pier, rather than taking an Uber or Lyft, it was easier to get another 24 hour pass. We were at our destination in 10 mins! After dinner and the boat ride we picked up some bikes and rode back to the hotel. The bonus being the next day we were able to enjoy the remaining time on our pass!There were bikes available at all locations, some of which had friendly staff on site to help. The bikes were sturdy and well maintained. There are plenty of spots to pick up and drop off!This made our trip and would recommend it for all ages. "
KClark901,"Detroit, Michigan",2,05/31/2018,Easy access but watch your time,"I'm rating this poor because I am frustrated with the payment system. We used the bikes on our stay in Chicago as a easy way to get around, which it was and they were great. BUT you have to watch your time! We docked our bikes less than 2 minutes ""over"" and were charged another 30 minutes. SO if you are going to use the bikes make sure you know your way around and where you will be docking them, otherwise you'll be paying them, and paying them, then paying them again!"
Robert G,"Bethesda, Maryland",4,05/27/2018,Wonderful Biking along Lake Michigan,"We were in Hyde Park to visit the University of Chicago and wanted to go Downtown for a day. Divvy Bikes made that possible without needing to take the CTA or the Metro or the South Shore Line, all possible alternatives. The day was beautiful and we were able to ride along the Lake Front from Hyde Park to the Art Institute. Once we crossed the outer drive at 55th street using the underpass, it was beautiful riding with no traffic lights and no cars. Time for an easy ride, about 35 minutes. Divvy Bikes was easy to use for a full 24 hour duration that allowed us to get on and off downtown as we pleased. We had a little trouble at two docking or parking spots where the codes did not work, but we managed to get it straight within a few minutes (by replacing the two bikes we took out and then starting over again for the three bikes that we needed. I recommend biking around Chicago from Hyde Park to downtown. Bring your own helmet."
JoeyBinChicago,"Chicago, IL",5,05/01/2018,New Fare Structure!,"First, please ignore the one star reviews that say ""it isn't clear I have to return the bike in 30 minutes"". It's right there on the machine when you dip your card in, so there' s no ""scam"" going on, just folks who don't take the time to read the instructions. The new fare structure has a $15 ""explorer pass"" which allows you to take the bike out for up to 3 hours without re-docking, There's also a $3 option for a single 30 minute ride. They keep adding more bikes and stations, so the system keeps getting better."
vacationaholic,Central Oregon,5,04/29/2018,What an easy way to see Chicago,"Got a Divvy bike across from the Hilton Chicago. Checked out their bike program first online, then hit the streets. $3/30 min with credit card. If bike is lost or stolen, then $1200 charge. Easy to find other Divvy racks to dock your bike. Make sure the green light is lit before you walk away from bike and check the area you want to bike to, to see if there is available dock for your bike. 3 speed bikes with baskets. Chicago isn't the most bike friendly town, so you'll be dodging peds. Overall, I really liked using this program for my visit to Chicago."
Lenore J,,5,01/21/2018,divvy bikes,it is grate to have if you are new to the city there are many places to doc themi rode around went shopping and did things i needed to do i have a bike butit needed air in the tires i said o well i will just rent a bike for a few days
fiona w,"Thornbury, United Kingdom",4,10/29/2017,Good concept but needs work,"Loved the concept of this! Being able to cycle from place to place and return your bike so no worrying about locking it to anything. This was great as visiting from the UK means we obviously couldn't bring our own bikes! The bikes were heavy but were easy to ride. I think we had 4 or 5 different bikes throughout the day, generally all were in good condition with the exception of the last one. Chicago by bike is a good way to go and this concept is brilliant.Bikes were hard to get out of the locks and also at times hard to put back in again!Would recommend using these though as made us be able to see alot more of the city on our short trip. "
BR_MikeD,"Baton Rouge, Louisiana",4,10/22/2017,"Fun way to get around, and get a some exercise too!!!","The $9.95 day pass is a good deal, but be prepared to switch bikes every half hour...not a second more. As a frustrated reviewer noted, you will be billed. However, quite fun to ride along the lake, get to the museums and the Navy Pier, Millenium Park, the Bean, etc. The instructions could be made easier for us folks getting up in years. Still a great way to see the lakefront."
269priyankap,"Scottsdale, Arizona",5,10/18/2017,Perfect way to experience Chicago's downtown,"They are so well organized, we took a 24Hour pass (Keep a watch on the clock because you have to return back to the stand every 30 mins unless you want to pay ofcourse- the app is amazing, it will guide you to the Divvy stand close to you)We were cycling around Downtown for close to 6 hours :) I think Chicago is soo pretty that driving around it would be an injustice. Stop at good spots, do not miss to capture the beautiful sunset. I am sure you will love it as much as I did :)"
frabjousfrank,"Seattle, Washington, United States",1,10/11/2017,Not For People Unfamiliar with Divvy's Deceptive Fee Structure,I got the $9.95 day pass. I was billed $102 because I either didn't see or understand their rental policy requiring you to check in your bicycle every 30 minutes. I had the bike for 22 hours. I had problems checking the bike out and when I called support they had to reboot the station software twice before I was able to check the bike out. During this frustrating period I didn't see any contractual obligations to check in the bike every 30 minutes.When I complained about the billing to customer service they reduced my fee by $50 which I found to be unacceptable. I disputed the charges with my credit card company and they honored my contention and in the end I was only charged $9.95.If you're unfamiliar with the Chicago Metro area Divvy's 30 minute check in requirement and the fallibility of their network may cost you more grief than the convenience of their bicycles.The bikes are 3 speed and are generally suitable for typical short recreational/commuter rides.Their fee structure and use policies need to be more clearly stated and printed on your receipt and at the rental kiosk.
marcelodO7773GX,"Jundiai, SP",5,10/09/2017,Amazing experience,enjoying Chicago on a bike is an incredible experience. I recommend this pleasure to everyone Aline or Friends
panama2000,"Providence, Rhode Island",5,10/03/2017,"Great value, great fun.","Many places rent bikes for $10/hour. Divvy is $10 for the day as long as you swap out the bikes every 30 minutes. It was easy to do. We picked up the bikes along the water from by millennium park. We biked south along the river, swapping out at McCormick Place. Then we went to the Museum of Science and Industry. After a few hours we took bikes from the station in front of the museum and cycled back, swapping out again at McCormick. It is a fantastic dedicated path,not near any cars and very well maintain"
Paulta2016,"Denver, Colorado",4,10/03/2017,Enjoy riding in Chicago,Chicago has some great trails to ride on and also see the sights Especially along the lake. These bikes are decent to get around. Mind you if you are avid rider you should rent a real road bike but these are truly just a bike. They are decently maintained but as one review said the fees can add up. I thought i was getting charged $10 for the day but ended up at $17. You really need to only go from docking point to docking point because they are only allotting you 30 minutes-at a time to ride before extra charges kick in. I know people in my home town that just go to the next docking point under the 30 minute time then take the same bike out and go to the next stop. Still would rent them again but you need to know how they charge.
katiek886,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5,09/23/2017,Who'd have thought?,"Who would have thought that renting a little blue bike for 24 hours would have been so worth it? Between the giggles and the easy sightseeing, 100% worth the rental. We got around so easily and saw a lot of things that were on the list it was fabulous! Just do it."
JimboOttawa_Canada,"Ottawa, Canada",3,09/05/2017,Read Before Renting,"The Divvy Bikes look like a good option but there are pitfalls. The price is right, there is no doubt. And, the bikes are in good shape for the most part. But, be aware that the cost can escalate if you are not careful. The $9.95 will cover numerous rides of under 30 minutes for the full 24 hour period. However, that means you have to renew the bike in under 30 minutes at one of the stations. If you do not, there are additional charges. We had problems with finding a station within thirty minutes and, on one occasion, finding a station with empty slots to renew our bike. Make sure you choose your bike wisely before taking it out of the stall. A few have soft tires, many are greasy and some seats are better than others. You use your credit card to rent and renew the bikes. We used one card for 4 bikes. But, that required that we all stick together so we could renew our bikes. Of course, we didn't think of that so occasionally went our own way. That created problems since our daughters could not renew their bikes. The time penalties are cumulative and can become costly. We found the thirty minute renewal time was not adequate. So, it is your choice to try to stay within the thirty minute renewal or ignore that requirement and pay the price."
suzannev326,"Baarn, The Netherlands",5,08/31/2017,Highly recommended,"The Divvy Bike Sharing is a highly recommended way of getting around Chicago. Ten dollars buys you a 24 hour pass. You can grab a bike from any station, take a ride and return the bike to any of the 580 station within 30 minutes. Get a new code, grab another bike and be on your way again. Very convenient!"
996christym,"Waco, Texas",4,08/28/2017,Great fun,"These bikes are all over the park area and downtown. It is a great way to take advantage of a bike city without hauling a bike. One downfall is having to check in at a divvy station every 30 mins. Sometimes we went over. But the fee for going over isn't too ridiculous, so it was still a good bargain and great fun. Bikes are simple to operate and ride. Just watch out for the bike commuters. They are traveling with a purpose, frequently faster than motorized vehicles; they are not out for a leisurely ride. Give way to them. "
LorenzoelJefe,"Stratford, Canada",5,08/22/2017,The super fun approach to Chicago!,"Wing Commander had a DIVVY plan it it worked out ... TIP 1: Book 24 hours.TIP 2: North Side to Navy Pier, walk to Chicago River for Official Chicago Architectural Foundation Tour ... 7:30 PM is a charmer. Then return by  DIVVY under starlight and Chicago skyline all shined up.  Or some facsimile of the above itinerary ...AND you still have a morning ride along the Lakeshore in the opposite direction. TIP 3: We lost our code at 10 at night ... tap the screen, then reinsert credit card. Et voila a new pin will be printed for you. "
Amber K,"Tallahassee, Florida",5,08/15/2017,"Biking near ""beaches"" and outskirts of city is awesome","While riding the Ferris wheel on the Navy Pier, we decided to get the bikes and we went to the divvy website on our smartphones and got a $2 off coupon code. It's been a week and I have gotten no junk email from divvy, so that's good. For $10/day plus fees and tax, you get to use the bike for up to 30 min bike rides at a time at no extra cost. With the coupon code, my total was $10.50-something. Then there is a sliding scale for the length of your ride: 30-60 min is $2 extra, etc. but as long as you dock the bike at a station by 30min per ride you are not charged extra. Using the bikes for transportation along the boardwalk(?) on the water nearby the Navy Pier worked well for me, my teenage sister, adult sister and uncle. We had no extra charges for leasurely riding from Navy pier to Belmont. We were all thankful for the 3 gears that you can easily change on the right bike handle for going up and down the little inclines along the path. What a beautiful invigorating ride! The seats are adjustable and the ride is comfy. I don't usually ride a bike and my butt wasn't sore like it is after riding sometimes. I was able to strap my purse and water bottle on the front handlebars with the attached bungee-type cord and my belongings stayed secure."
Dianne K,"Auburn Hills, Michigan",1,08/08/2017,HORRIBLE SCAM.NEVER AGAIN,"DO NOT USE DIVVY BIKES. I swiped my card and agreed to a $39.98 payment for supposably a 24 HOUR RENTAL that we only ended up using for two hours!! This was not the case! Supposably you are suppose to ""check in"" every half hour, (which was not listed on the machine, nor was it listed in an email). Like I said, we used the bikes for TWO HOURS, THREE WEEKS AGO AND I JUST GOT CHARGED $170 TODAY. This is a scam for anyone and everyone that is not local and I'm sick to my stomach about it. When I called customer service I rudely got hung up on the first time, and the second call they told me they would refund half ($85) but only refunded me $65!!! I have a manager that is suppose to contact me in 24 hours so we will see how that goes. Had the instructions been more clear, we would've gladly paid the $6 additional for each bike for the additional 60 mins like its stated on the website. They had no right charging my card for a transaction I did not agree with unless the bikes were lost stolen or damaged!!! I filed a dispute with my bank, which I hardly doubt I will get my refund because visa has to take it to them to dispute and they are going to take that $170 that they literally pulled out of their butt, and say it's for a misc charge like they told me. I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN AND I ADVISE ANYONE AND EVERYONE TO NEVER USE THEM AGAIN NEITHER!! IF I WANTED TO OAY $170 FOR PETAL BIKES I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT FOUR BIKES THAT WE COULD HAVE USED FOR MUCH LONGER THAN 2 HOURS!! What a scam. "
Chelsea W,"Scottsdale, Arizona",5,08/01/2017,Best way to see the city!,"This was the best decisiion that we made on our trip. It was amazing to see the city and have some fun. You get everywhere fast, you never have to wait on public transportation. I see that some people complain about the 30 minutes, but it was never a problem for us. We rode from the Feild Musuem to Lincoln park and made it within 30 minutes. You will have no trouble. If you use the app you can ask for an additional 15 minutes to find a spot to dock your bike. It really should be no problem. If they didn't have people lock up their bikes, they would end up leaving it outside of restaurants/ stores while they shop. If it got stolen then you would be charged $1,200 The only way to prevent this would be to have bike locks on the bikes themselves. Seems more complicated that way."
jowags11,"Indian Rocks Beach, Florida",1,07/31/2017,Beware- 30 minute limit or pay $$$,"We have rented bikes in Philly, DC, San Fran, etc and had a great time exploring. We rented in Chicago for 3-4 hours -- the total charge was well over $200 bc we didn't find a station to ""check in"" every 30 minutes (which would have been impossible riding along the lakefront). It's a horrible concept if you want to take a bike and explore .... They also do not make it clear when you rent the bikes -- we will not be using it again!"
Dean C,"White Lake, Michigan",3,07/31/2017,Use them all the time,"I use them every time I'm in town. If the weather is good they are better than a car. The only thing that drives me nuts is the 30 minute time limit. That is really an inconvenience. They are fairly well maintained, but of the 5 bikes I was on this weekend only 1 did not have some problem, although all were minor."
673randyf,"Pinckney, Michigan",5,07/30/2017,Great concept ,"This is the 1st time we used the bike system. We got around faster and saw the sights. I gave a 5 star rating but there are a few problems. We rode to the field museum, when we arrived the rack was 100% full. You must wait until more bikes are rented before returning yours. This took 10 minutes of waiting, who knows it could have been an hour. Then you must find a rack and return the bike every 30 minutes to avoid extra charges. Even so I will use them again."
muncysells,"New Lebanon, Ohio",2,07/28/2017,Slightly annoying ,Bikes were in great condition. While we enjoyed the experience of riding through Chicago-it was a pain in the tale to find a docking station every 30 minutes that had empty slots and to have to re-swipe a credit card for yet another access code.
734tracym,"Neenah, Wisconsin",3,07/27/2017,"Good concept, difficult in practice","We liked the idea of these bikes that we saw all over the city, though in practice they were a little harder to use. You can only use them for 30 minutes before you get charged a fee, and it is a challenge to get the bikes out, get on the path, and get them back to another station within 30 minutes. An hour would be much more appropriate. In addition, we had to search hard to find a station with enough bikes for our family at times. The app was very helpful in finding the bike stations. We will probably not use it again, because of the challenges and the short length of time, I do not feel we got our money's worth. But if you are traveling solo, and know exactly where you will return your bike, it may work better for you. For a family riding on the Lakefront trail, you would be better off to rent from one of the bike rental shops in Millenium Park or on Navy Pier. "
fins2left2,"Birmingham, Alabama",4,07/26/2017,"Great idea, but be prepared for overage charges","I enjoyed Divvy. The bikes were well-maintained and in mostly decent locations. However, there are several issues you should be aware of in advance. 1) The TRANSIT app is awful. It is difficult to locate the nearest Divvy stations -- so you can drive 10 minutes looking for one. They aren't accurate and the app crashes more than any other app I have had. AND-- even drivers couldn't tell us where they are located. Thankfully, one gave us 2 off the book bikes until we found another station!2) The time starts rolling as soon as you get your bike. In a few cases, we unlocked on, then it took 2-3 minutes to get the second out. That time counts against you.3) At night, the stations aren't lit, so we drove around for 45 minutes just looking for one! (hence an overage charge). The bikes are great and hopefully the app will get better with time. I would do it again, but now I know where they are all located."
Shane C,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5,07/24/2017,Worth the $10!,"We took full advantage of our 24 hour rental (noon-noon) -- we used it over two days since it starts your time once you purchase a pass. Although the 30 minute limit is a challenge/slight inconvenience it was peanuts compared to paying much more for full rentals. There are so many bike stations throughout the metro area it's nearly impossible not to pass by one to re-up the 30 minute slot. Made getting through the city a breeze and allowed us to make incredible time to see more than we thought we could! Not all roads have bike lanes but the sidewalks are oversized which made riding them there safe and not a nuisance to walkers. PRO TIP: the 30-minute time limit is their money maker. Avoid paying extra by downloading the Transit App from smartphone App Store and buying a pass for Divvy there. This allows you to immediately get your unlock codes on your phone. Best part -- you can re-dock your bike and IMMEDIATELY get it back (or a different one) for 30 MORE minutes without paying overage. Sounds like a hassle, but because of how many docks there are it is very easy. Without doing this you could end up paying $102 for a single day rental! "
FamilyOfFour91,"North Wales, Pennsylvania",3,07/20/2017,Not Necessarily for Tourists,"The $9.99 for an all-day pass caught our eye and my daughter and I decided to use the Divvy bikes to ride along the Lakefront Trail in Chicago. We got the first bike off the rack with no problem. We had issues with the codes provided for the second bike and it took us about 15 minutes to successfully unlock a bike. We ended up using the bikes for almost 5 hours. We loved Divvy bikes until we got home and saw a $156 charge on our credit card! I called Divvy only to discover that we did not understand how the all-day pass works. You need to use the bike in 30-minute intervals. You have to return the bike to a Divvy rack, located throughout the city, within 30 minutes of acquiring the bike! The pass gives you unlimited 30-minute intervals - maybe good for a Chicago commuter, but not ideal for a tourist. They were unwilling to negotiate the charge at first. After a threat to dispute the charge with my credit card company, Divvy agreed to a one-time 50% refund as a courtesy. Since the rental charge at another bike rental company would've been $40 per bike for all day, I was happy with this agreement. Be sure you understand the terms of the all-day bike pass!"
skokie5030,"Chicago, Illinois",3,07/19/2017,Getting the bike eats up limited time. No way to review charges,"The process for signing in and getting a code can be cumbersome and doesn't always work. When it works on the first try, its great. When it doesn't, it can take 10 min to get a bike. There is no way to review the charges. My cc charge was twice the $9.99 daily rate. I have no idea what the additional charges were for and have no way to dispute them. The instructions on the website are terrible. But when the bikes work, biking is great!"
red_sunshine123,"Chicago, Illinois",4,07/14/2017,"Great App, Loved the Bikes but 30 check-in time too inconvenient","I hadn't ridden a bike in years so I was very excited to be able to ride a bike with my family last weekend. I really loved the 'Transit' App which allowed me to sigh-up and pay in advance. This was really helpful when I arrived at the bike station. When I saw the line at the machine to pay I smiled and walked right pass to my choice of bike. Yes!!!The bikes were nice and easy to use. All the ones I saw were in good condition. However, I do have 'one' issue that will prevent me from using the program as a family outing again.The 30 minute time limit is too constraining to put it nicely. When starting, I would have to set a 30min timer on my iphone and watch it every so often as time passes fast. After 20 minutes expired, I would have to gather the family so we could find the nearest bike station and stop. Seems easy, but try that when you separate from your family. Ugh!!! If there's a way to avoid the 30 minute requirement, (without paying the extra fees) I will use the bikes again. If not, then I'll pass."
21rond,,2,07/09/2017,"great idea, awesome bikes, scheming dishonest company with no customer service","Bought 24 hour pass. Had lots of nice rides. About 6 hours into my 24 hours, the station I was at would NOT give me a bike. Code from app did not work. ""Pass not Valid"" So I tried the process through the terminal at the station. Did not work there either. Tried to call and customer service not available. Soooooo, my wife put hers back too and we walked. When I got ahold of someone later to ask for some credit on my card, I was told that they DO NOT GUARANTEE YOUR ACCOUNT WILL WORK. So you are paying for a pass which they reserve the right to deny at will, whenever. Divvy -""You should have called the help number on the terminal, they would have told you to try another nearby terminal""Me - ""I did, but customer service was not available""Divvy - ""Well you should have tried to call more.""SO, even though the terminal said ""pass invalid"" it really meant ""pass invalid at this station for unknown reasons but you can get a bike at another "" and I would have known that if I had made multiple customer service call attempts."
Jet565783,,1,07/06/2017,Horrible customer service and not clear rates,Love the idea of this company but it is not practical for tourists and I think they take advantage of that. Read carefully the day pass contract. 9.95 for 30 min rides but if you don't dock the bike every 30 min they rack up the charges on your cc. Not practical to even ride along the lake and find a station to dock at in 30 minutes. So disappointed. When you call they are not helpful at at and kinda rude! Beware!
jcarnley2017,"Wichita, Kansas",5,07/05/2017,"Divvy Bikes, no problems.",Downloaded the Transit app and rented 4 bikes via Divvy for 24 hours to use for exploring the Navy Pier without any hiccups.  Extremely convenient!
46neilc,"Melbourne, Australia",5,07/05/2017,"Excellent bike sharing system, read the FAQ's first.","I have read the last couple of reviews below and i can't see how by them not locking the bikes in correctly is a fault of Divvy? It has very clear instructions in the FAQ's stating that if you don't get a green light on the dock, then remove the bike and try again. The docks are not perfect because i saw people time and time again just slam them in and walk away without checking, I giggled to myself as i imagined their bank accounts emptying as well. My wife and i used the system for one day with 2 passes and didn't have a problem, always checked for the green light, sat in the shade to have a rest then grabbed the same 2 bikes and commenced our next 30 minutes, setting a timer for 25 minutes and using the App to locate the next docking station. We'll be using the bike share in Washington DC and New York as well.The unfortunate thing is that common sense is not so common these days!!A great system, even a couple of Aussies had to explain it to a few Americans.......who would have thought?"
madelinehume,"Zurich, Switzerland",1,07/01/2017,Do not use!! Takes advantage of first time users ,"If you are a tourist visiting Chicago, do NOT use divvy. I'm a Chicago native and rented a 24 hour bike pass just to commute to work. I had never used the service before. Unfortunately when I returned the bike 20 minutes after renting it, evidently it ""didn't lock properly"" even though I was physically unable to remove the bike from the lock (I checked). Because of this, I was charged $80 for the time it took for an associate to notice the problem, even though I had returned the bike within the 30 min period. For reference, the annual pass is $99. I was so disappointed with the customer service and the exorbitant fee Divvy charged, especially when the name of the pass (24 hour pass) is extremely misleading for tourists. I would not recommend this service under any circumstances, because the mistake I made was impossible for a first time user to know, and it was extremely costly to do so. "
Shannon B,,1,06/28/2017,Enjoyed the experience but lousy customer service,Used the bikes to get from Buckingham Fountain to Navy Pier and back. Had a great time and enjoyed the ride. Less than 30 minutes each way. Imagine my surprise when my credit card billed came in at $132. Called the company and they found my rental. Stated their records showed a 6 hour bike ride and that we must have returned the bikes improperly. Flat out refused to refund any of my money. Absolutely lousy customer service. Will not be using the bikes in Chicago ever again. Would give less than a one rating if it existed.
JDesRoches2014,"Sherbrooke, Canada",4,06/27/2017,"What a great way to discover the 606, Millenium park and the lakeside.","Ride 30 minutes, Dock the bike. Drink à coffre. Take another bike. Ride for 30 minutes. Dock it. Visit a site. All day long. Simple. Nice city to bike."
intreped,Connecticut,5,06/26/2017,Good first time experience,"My wife and I used Divvy Bikes to ride north on the lake path from our hotel near the Hancock Tower to the north end of Lincoln Park. We dropped off the bikes at Fullerton Avenue, then walked south via the Botanical Garden and Zoo, having a nice lunch at Café Brauer before picking up our return rides at North Avenue. It was a great way to enjoy the beautiful day and super cheap to boot."
a b,"Murrells Inlet, South Carolina",5,06/25/2017,Geat way to see Chicago/lake Michigan,Bikes are available in many places around Lakeshore Blvd. $9.99 for daily rental. You do not have to return bike to same location at end of trip. Great way to see alot of lake area without walking. Bikes have adjustable seats and 3 gears. Well worth the price.
bryn b,,4,06/23/2017,Biking,This is a great service for tourist. You rent a bike for 1 day and you get unlimited 30-minute bike rides in that one day. If you go over 30 minutes you get charged extra. There are docking stations all over. We rode from the beach to navy pier along the shoreline and loved it. Great experience! 
Carly C,,1,06/22/2017,TERRIBLE AND MISLEADING,"BE CAREFULL!! The real you in with their ""24-hour pass"" making you believe you have 24 hours to ride around the city and enjoy the bike. Then a charge for an outrageous amount shows up on your credit card and you have no idea why. They fool people who don't read the fine print which says you have to return to a dock station every 30 minutes or you will be charged extra, a lot extra. Meanwhile, it takes 5-10 minutes to have the group all return and then repurchase their bikes each time. Their customer service also couldn't care less if you saw that caveat to their rental terms or not when you rented. Do not use this service until they change their terms!!!"
wendyn561,"West Chester, Pennsylvania",5,06/14/2017,Easy to use & tons of Divvy bike locations,"Recently used the Divvy Bikes downtown Chicago and they worked out really well. The bikes had three gears which was very helpful. We have rented in NYC too and I'm pretty sure only had one gear. Tons of pit stops to ""check-in"" every 30 minutes. There is also a tie-on the front of the bike that you can loop your water into/bag whatever. Would definitely rent again."
willow181499,"Chicago, Illinois",2,06/13/2017,Limited to 30 minute stretches,Every half hour you have to check the bike in somewhere or get dinged for extra charges. kind of a cheap shot.
277Mary,"Manchester, New Hampshire",4,06/12/2017,Visiting my son in Chicago,We both used divvy bikes to tour Chicago! We had a great time! So easy to get around and there are so many bike sites to park and ride! They are easy to operate and I would gladly use them on my next visit!
Elizabeth H,,1,06/12/2017,Rip Off,I ended up having to pay $45 for my 2.5hr ride because the rules were not clearly explained. Apparently every 30 minutes you have to turn the bike in and get out a new one. An employee even helped me fill out my information at the kiosk and he never explained this rule. Total rip off!!
Annette R,,3,06/11/2017,30 minute check in's are not convenient,We enjoyed our rental but found the fact that you have to check in your bike every  30 minutes awkward. I have to reserve full review for when we get our bill.  Especially  after reading the other reviews and how customers got overcharged.
Melissa S,"Atlanta, Georgia",5,06/08/2017,Great Way to see the city!,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Hyde Park this past weekend and this was probably one of the best parts of our weekend! We rode the divvy bikes along the lake front and into the city, along the river, through the Gold Coast into the Old Town and up to Wrigleyville! We LOVED it! Such an amazing way to travel around the city and get a little exercise in! I would definitely recommend this to everyone!"
Nakul G,,1,06/06/2017,First time rider experience - Old style docking station/ Fraudulent charges,"June 2,2017 - I rented the bike for 24 hours for 9.95$/day. I made 4 short trips the same day. Each time, I made sure that bike was docked within stipulated 30 mins. Divvy charged 90$ fees on my card. When I called customer care to inquire, firstly the lady was not courteous, she said I rented the bike for over 4 hours 42 mins. When I mentioned that i did not look the bike out for too long, she said that I did not dock the bike properly in my second trip. She kept on insisting that it was my fault and would not listen to me . She asked me the color code that machine displayed, as if I will remember every second of the journey. After 20-30 mins of hold time, the supervisor offered me to take 50% refund, which I refused to.I will not ride the bike again & will not recommend it. Divvy is making money with dishonest ways. Their docking stations are old fashioned & they are perhaps not upgrading, so they can deceive daily riders. The supervisor mentioned there are no cameras on the stations and they trust their docking stations, which is hard to believe after the incident.I hope such complaints make it city of chicago & they look into the matter."
Sam G,,1,06/02/2017,Be Very Careful,Be very careful if you rent bikes from this company. I rented two bikes for less than 24 hours and was charged $113.00 instead of the roughly $20 it should have been. They claimed that one of the bikes was not docked properly even though I made sure they were locked in place. Divvy refuses to issue a refund. DO NOT USE THIS SCAM COMPANY.
Nich-O-Licious,"Austin, Texas",5,05/30/2017,"Handy, cheap service for exploring Chicago","While visiting over Memorial Day Weekend my friends and I used the Divvy service, each purchasing a daily pass multiple times. Stations are conveniently located throughout the area we visited (Magnificent Mile & Gold Coast) and we seldom ran into issues where there weren't enough bikes for us. Sometimes the 30 minute timer is a little inconvenient, but it's easy to work with. This service functions MUCH better than the equivalent service in NYC"
Turnkey56,"Seattle, Washington",4,05/27/2017,Fun Ride on Lakeshore,A group of eight rented the bikes and rode from the Navy Pier to Edgewater. Fun ride along the waterfront. A few glitches when checking in the bike every 30 minutes along with a few detours but overall was a lot of fun.
wendybW7121HM,,4,05/15/2017,Bikes ,We really enjoyed traveling around Chicago on the bikes. Chicago has bike lanes. They can be tricky because you may think they are on one side of the street and they are on the other. We used the bikes a lot. It was well worth the 10$ all day. We only used bikes. No busses at all. Most of our docking stations were near the locations we were visiting. Happy Biking. 
SBHTravels,"Miami, Florida",3,04/30/2017,Great Biking in Chicago but Bike Stations Not Convenient,I love to bike in cities and Chicago is a fabulous place because they have 18 miles of uninterrupted bike trails along the lake. However Divvy Bikes require you to check in every 30 minutes and when you get south of Soldier Field the bike stations are not along the lake front so you either have to cross streets or go well off the trail to dock your bike. If you choose not to dock (which we did) then you have to pay a surcharge which runs up your bill. You probably are better off renting from the bike rental place in Millennium Park and paying the day charge so you don't have to fool with the bike docking stations. If the check in was every hour it would be much better. Bikes were in decent condition and loved the ride.
Karl S,"Guelph, Canada",1,04/18/2017,Expect to pay way more than what is advertised,"False advertising. Do not go here if you think you can do a bike down the lake, or anything of significance in the city. We had a nice surprise waiting for us when we got back home on our credit card bill. If you actually want to enjoy the bike and experience go to another vendor (bike and roll, Bobby's bike hike). Despite fewer drop off locations, you could cab to these places, bike, cab home and still be cheaper then the crooks at divvy. Needless to say, a lot better bikes that are actually looked after and guaranteed to have them there, unlike divvy stations.Rule of thumb to spread around: If walking down the streets of Chicago, avoid the light blue bikes at all costs."
Taylor M,"Dallas, Texas",5,04/10/2017,Great way to see all of Downtown!,"My wife and I discovered the Divvy Bikes on our last day in Chicago. We still downloaded the app (very easy) and were on our way in less than 5 minutes. Great way to see the sites without walking all over the place or paying for an overpriced tour. Chicago is very bike friendly with tons of bike routes and parks to ride the bikes through. My wife and I were hesitant at first to ride through downtown on the bikes, but found ended up going anyways and we had a great time. There are Divvy Bike racks all over town and with the app they are easy to find and return the bikes. I would highly recommend renting the Divvy bikes while you are in Chicago!"
katehclark,"Chicago, Illinois",1,04/09/2017,Crappy Service with a Crappy System,"DO NOT USE DIVVY BIKES!! This was the worst experience that I have had in a long time! I was completely screwed over by this company! I docked my bike at one of the stations (correctly, I might add) and the system didn't register that it was there. So, I had to go back and find the bike and re-dock it correctly, except it wasn't there! So I called Divvy and told them that the bike was gone, at which point they told me to call every hour and see if the bike was re-docked anywhere else. 30 hours later, after calling dozens of time, filing a police report for a missing bike, and getting told I was going to have to pay $1200 to replace the bike it was finally re-docked. I was left with a $100 charge on my credit card when it should have been $20. Needless to say, I will not use Divvy bikes again, Their system caused me horrible stress and $100 I did not owe them"
Matt H,New Jersey,5,04/02/2017,Divvy across all of downtown,"We used Divvy bicycles to go all the way from Navy Pier to the Planetarium. You can access many of Chicago's attractions. Just make sure you keep track of where all the stations are. That way you can return your bike, and just take it out again."
Peggy C,"Troy, Michigan",5,02/21/2017,Easy access to bikes,"On a nice day, this is a wonderful way to see the city.  The station's were at every site we went to and bikes were in great condition.  And it save a fortune in cabs!"
nickytravels2014,"East London, South Africa",4,11/29/2016,Great fun - download the app!,"Great way to see the city. No real expertise needed - I hadn't been on a bike for years!The designated bike lanes are a helpful route guide.You do have to check in every 30 minutes. Finding these stations can be a little tricky in the busy city centre. We rode right past the one we were looking for! I assume that the app would help with this. Checking in seems a hassle but there is so much to see and experience in the city that the 30 minute rides are really all the time you need to get from 1 ""must see"" to the next.Credit card essential, you swipe at every check in point. Card is charged once for the day and then again only if you miss a 30 minute check in deadline - this can be an expensive mistake!"
Tanner V,"Rochester, Minnesota",4,11/27/2016,A fun and exciting way to explore Chicago!,"My fiance and I used two bikes to ride along the Lake Michigan riverwalk from the Shedd Aquarium to the oak street beach. The bikes were in good condition and comfortable to ride. The process to rent the bikes out and then dock them when finished is easy. I have two issues keeping me from giving 5 out of 5. I dislike that the only option/""plan"" is to pay $10 per bike for a 24 hour pass. The other issue is that you have to dock your bike every 30 minutes or else you get charged an additional amount, which depends on how much longer you had between docking beyond 30 minutes. Our ride took 40 minutes and so we were charged an extra $2 per bike for going 10 minutes over. The real kicker is that we were unable to use the bike service in the next 24 hours because we had pre planned most of our trip. All in all, I paid $24 to rent two bikes for 40 minutes. It's not gonna break my bank but it's frustrating that there is no other option for rent duration. We still loved the service though!"
mattb185,"Kansas City, Missouri",5,11/12/2016,Such a great way to see the city.,"I would highly recommend this for anyone. It is not only economical, but in many instances it is faster than driving to many locations. The city has done a great job of catering to cyclists and lanes and even dedicated street lights."
RichardM6605,,5,11/09/2016,Exploring Chicago with Divvy,The Transit app sucks but with the help of Citymapper and Divvy we had really awesome Chicago experience.
SolanaBeach2014,"San Diego, California",4,11/05/2016,Best transport in Chicago ,"We've used city bike programs in the past but for the first time, there are enough stations to truly make this replace other public transport, a car or even uber- all of which is actually much slower let alone more expensive. Locals probably get year memberships but visitors can get one day passes $9.95 which gives you unlimited 30' or less rides. Rides over 30' costs extra, but Chicago center is a small (relatively) manageable city for a visitor most stations are less then 4 mi apart. The stations near big attractions like Millennium Park may be low on bikes but just wait and people start dropping them off. You have to use the same credit card at each station to identify yourself and get a new code. Bike codes unlock the bike. The few downsides: no helmet rental so BYOH and the kiosks don't respond well to touch as they should. The bikes are heavy and durable and are the step in kind - unisex. They fit most any height - I'm less than 5' and the hubs 6'. We used them to go from Lincoln Park, to 3 locations downtown, to Old Town and to different areas of lincoln Park. All easy. Good roads. Night lights in the front res blinkers in the back. Importantly - download CHI Bike app and it will always tell you the closest station as well as a map of all stations. Pretty convenient. "
cighh,"Duffel, Belgium",5,10/26/2016,Convenient ,Probably the most convenient way to go back to the hotel from the McCormick or to spend some time discovering the city.
MattP2600,,5,10/25/2016,Loved it!,"Chicago's is amazingly bike-friendly, and Divvy is a great way to enjoy it. There's stations pretty much everywhere. The only drawback for me was the fairly high price for a 24h pass of $9.95, but I found a promo code through Transit App which knocked it down to $7."
Martha D,,4,10/25/2016,Was my favorite thing I did in Chicago.,"As others have said, you can rent for 24 hours for $10, but that means you have to check in the bike every 30 minutes. It's intended to be a commuter bike experience, not a long-term bike rental. We had no luck getting the bikes using the station, called customer service and they suggested using the transit app. That worked! The stations are close together and easy to find. It's so much fun to ride along the lake."
satters1981,"Reading, United Kingdom",4,10/24/2016,"Excellent availability of bikes, quality of bikes. Cost and payment system could be better","Bike stations are never too far away and the 30 minute limit is long enough in Chicago to do almost all of the hops that we wanted to do. All of the bikes we rented save one was in excellent working order and there was no problem to swap out for another in that case.Only feedback we would have is that there was no longer term deal - the 24 hour option we used 4 days in a row and it felt like we should have got some kind of a deal on that. More seriously the credit card system was not working properly and after getting three messages saying the system had timed out, later found that I had been charged each time so will of course be requesting this is reimbursed."
marylandcindy31,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",1,10/23/2016,Renter beware,"Divvy has rent all day for 9.95. I didn't notice you have to dock bikes every 30 minutes. Was overcharged. When I went to customer service they said I didn't read and can't get it adjusted. Okay I realize it was my fault but I never rented a bike not read fine print. No great customer service, bad clunky bikes, and just out for making a buck. Crappy business. "
gabbynguyen,"Fort Worth, Texas",5,10/15/2016,Best part of the trjp,"Biked down lakeshore drive with a couple of friends using the divvy bikes was such an ease. What made it even easier was not having to wait in line for a new code for a new bike because we just requested one on the transit app! Wow, definitely coming back and doing the same thing. 10/10 would recommend."
Mjquinn56,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",3,10/12/2016,Fun way to get along the lake,"In town to watch someone run the marathon. It's $9.95 for 24 hours of rental but is you use it for more than 30 minutes at a time they start dinging your credit so you need to check the bike in at least every 30 minutes which can be a bit of a hassle.Also we arrive at a few few destinations and there were no empty spaces, fortunately we had time to find another location, but that could have been a headache."
Casey H,,5,10/04/2016,Best way to get around Chicago,My husband and I used Divvy for 2 days of our 3 day trip! It was quick and easy - they had docks wherever we went!
ercks,"Evanston, Illinois",1,10/01/2016,Cheaper to Purchase a New Bike,I wish I could give a rating of zero stars. I rented a bike near St. Francis Hospital so that I could go visit my aunt who was in from out of town. I purchased the 24 hour unlimited ride rental. Good deal right? NO. DON'T EVER RENT A BIKE FROM DIVVY. It's a scam. You can rent as many bikes from DIFFERENT docks for the 24 hour rate in 30 minute increments. That rule is supposedly displayed in fine print on the screen. Should that be written in BOLD on the bike and the kiosk? It cost me $109 to rent a bike for 8 hours. I should have purchased a bike and given it away when I was finished. Does Trump own DIVVY?
Betsy T,Morgantown,5,09/24/2016,Divvy all day !,Get the app ($2 coupon) and helps to ease your docking and undocking. Chicago is a great place to bike around and these bikes are solid. Be sure to wear a watch so that you can watch your time (30 min. a ride) but you can easily just doc and undoc again and keep riding. I am hoping that I made all my time limits and don't find an additional charge on my credit card ! It did seem easy and you meet fun people docking and undocking ! Get your first bike early and ride all day !
saminolesoccer,raleigh,3,09/22/2016,Fun bike ride; disappointed with the final cost,"Beautiful September day to bike the city. Quite the adventure weaving through crowds of people on a Sunday afternoon, meandering through cars and taxi drivers and walking our bikes across Navy pier. Those experiences are fun memories. However, what puts a bad taste in my mouth is the charge to my credit card: $39 instead of the $9.95 for the day, or two total hour ride. The fine print instructs you to ""return"" your bike every thirty minutes to a docking station to keep the price at $9.95 for the day. If we did this our memorable experience would have been a nightmare instead. I would've rented bikes from Bobby's Bike Hike for the same price and gotten a better bike if I read the fine print. Just keep this in mind when you plan your trip."
wrightc87,"High Point, North Carolina",1,09/19/2016,Poor customer service,"Great option to get around using the lake front trail while visiting Chicago (BUT you should be warned that there are tons of races on the trail during the weekend). However, my first code didn't work. Got another. Finally got a bike and the seat was broken (dropped down within 2 min or riding). Stopped at the next station and returned my bike to get a new one....except after I returned it the comp didn't work. Called customer service and they told me to walk to the next station....while my time using it is ticking away. I asked for a discount due to he multiple calls made to customer service, inconvenience of their system and bike(s) not working, and reduced time actually being able to use the bike and was refused.I love the concepts of bikes in the big city and have done this in Denver and Boston previously. However, I would never use this company again."
bradvice,"Denver, Colorado",5,09/19/2016,Divvy round the Lake edge,"Rented a couple of Divvy bikes to explore around the Lake front in Chicago while visiting our son who lives in Streeterville. I love this concept of 24 hour membership and free rental. The stations' spacing makes it easy to get to destination without having to go over the 30 minute free rental. For longer destination, its easy to stop at station and quickly check same bike out for continued ride and another 30 minutes free. Did this in DC recently and had a similar good time. The bikes are heavy though and have limited top end gearing so that 15 mph is about as fast as you'll cruise, even if you're a strong biker. The three speed shifters have all worked well and allow for easy slow speed take offs and climbs. Easy quick-release post allows for quick seat adjustment (remember, about a 90% leg extension is about what you should be aiming for to allow the best efficiency.) The tire pressure has been good on all the bikes I've tested and subsequently chosen fir each trip.No helmets is the one down side to the system. I hope this concept is taken to every major metropolitan city in the world. We have a good one in my hometown, Denver but i haven't tried it here cuz this is where my bikes live with me."
peet_sagitt,"Wellington, New Zealand",5,09/19/2016,Good quality,"Positive: lots of stations around the city, easy to use application, good quality bikes;
Negative: application doesn't work offline"
Melissa796,"The Hague, The Netherlands",5,09/17/2016,Awesome!!!,"LOVE these bikes. Easy to use, convenient, fast, fun, exciting, the app is awesome, etc. Can't say enough good things about it. We loved using these bikes to get around the city to explore, shop, travel, etc. Will definitely do it again. Wish all cities had these."
horninco,"Plano, Texas",4,09/16/2016,Fantastic idea,"Great way to get around the city. YOu get 30 minutes per trip but it's $10 for a 24 hour period and they have bike racks everywhere and the app is pretty accurate telling you where to find them.We grabbed one in the morning by the river and woudl boke down to the field or to navy pier or up north and then drop it off. Then come back out and grab another. You do have to be brave to ride in the downtown streets. Sidewalks are crowded and although we did ride on them on occassion, it's not ideal most of the time."
billmoll,"Clarendon Hills, Illinois",5,09/12/2016,Best way to get around...except in winter,"I've been a key-carrying member since the bike share service began in Chicago. I have used Divvy bikes for basic downtown commuting. I feel like a grannie sitting on the ample seat but they're certainly solid machines. The 2 biggest complaints I have are with the ""basket,"" a metal brace with bungee straps. And, I've ridden too many bikes with gear slip problems.But these shortcomings aren't enough to dissuade me from using the service anytime I'm in the city. There are nifty apps that give you the number of open bike stalls and the number of available bikes...very important when it's a high demand part of the day.I just re-upped my subscription and I'm glad TripAdvisor is allowing me to share my thoughts.Unless you're a passing-through traveler...buying an annual subscription for unlimited use is the best way to go. And...bring your helmet."
OttoKris B,,5,09/11/2016,Loved this!,"This was great for us as there are stations all over the place. Not too keen on the 30 minute check in as we are tourists and wanted to stop and smell the roses a bit. Lots of great things about this program especially the Divvy Dudes that were nearby to give tourist assistance. One guy, Danny Drinkwater, was so helpful and a pleasure to interact with as we had no idea what we were doing. What a great ambassador for the program!"
DwightD1983,"Springfield, Ohio",4,09/11/2016,Nice Cruising Ride,While the family went to the American Girl store I cruised from Hyatt McCormick Place along the lakefront.  I rode at a leisurely pace to Navy Pier and back seeing Grant Park and Buckingham Fountain.  This was a memorable part of my trip.
RachKas,"Melbourne, Australia",5,09/07/2016,HIGHLY recommend!!,"Guys.... Get these bikes!!!!! We had such an amazing times over 2 days riding around the city. We hired for 24 hours, picked them up at 1.30pm so had all afternoon and all next morning over the Labor Day weekend. Perfect."
octoberthirtyone,"Detroit, Michigan",5,09/07/2016,No issues,Great experience. The mobile app was easy to use. Payment was easy. Bike retrieval was easy. Did I mention it was fun?
BML111,"Boston, Massachusetts",2,09/07/2016,Hit a SNAG!,"We wanted to rent bikes near Navy Pier for a ride to the Adler. When we got to the stand, there were only 2 bikes (we needed 3) and those were broken. We walked to the next stand which said there was 8 bikes available. We get there and while there are 5 bikes, they are all broken or not able to be undocked. It felt like many people did not understand how the system worked either. The vans that maintain the docking areas were not on top of their game this day. While it is a great idea, I think a little more public education of the idea is necessary as is the maintenance of the bikes and docking facilities"
Urbestpalal,Algonquin,5,09/04/2016,Easy Fun Transportation ,"I have always wanted to try Divvy Bikes downtown and this weekend finally had a reason too. I was traveling around Chicago with my husband and realized divvy bikes would allow us to get all offer much quicker. I had never used this before and it was so easy! You pay $9.95 for 24 hours if you use the bikes at 30 minutes intervals. (If you use for longer you either pay a little bit extra or stop and exchange before your 30 minutes is up). There are a lot of locations and easy driving bikes, especially along the lake shore."
DonnaS420,"Sacramento, California",1,09/04/2016,Epic Labor Day Weekend FAIL,"Systems down & ineffective operating. Didn't recognize bike being turned in, wouldn't let us check out bike, system down & wouldn't let us do anything. Divvy tech guy at Field was zero help except to suggest we walk to next station and wait for someone to check in a bike. Customer service number at least had a live person but confirmed the two closest stations were empty of bikes. Oh, and app does not show all the stations apparently. Next time we'll rent a bike for the day and do away with this massive time suck!"
bklyn7581,"Brooklyn, New York",5,08/30/2016,Chicago's Diivy Bike Share is great!!,"I enjoyed using the Diivy Bike so much. Using it to ride along the Lakeshore Drive trail was absolutely one of my favorite parts of my trip to Chicago!!Using the recommended Transit app in conjunction with the bike rental was vital to me. It was very intuitive, fast, and easy to use and I was so happy it was available. I found it to be accurate in terms of alerting me to the number of Bikes and return docks available at each station around Chicago, which was a blessing in terms of helping me determine which dock was nearest with the most Bikes (for me to start my ride) and how far I should ride to if I needed an extended trip (based on where Bikes were most available to restart my 30 minutes). I would not have been able to utilize the Diivy with as much success and satisfaction as I could have without the Transit app. Getting a new code was so fast that I didnt even have to unload my stuff from a bike I was returning in order to take it right out again. It was so great. I would avoid trying to get a bike from the downtown area/loop area around rush hour/ sundown. It's difficult."
Stephanie P,New Orleans,5,08/29/2016,Highly recommend,We had such a great time on our bikes.  Never any problems finding a bike or a place to drop them off when we were finished.  Perfect way to see Chicago.
Scott M,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5,08/24/2016,Great way to see the lake front,"My first trip to Chicago and I decided to bike around rather than walk. Divvy rocks! they are so easy to use and are spaced out well. And cheap! Insider tips: 1) Check in with your same credit card if trading in every 30 minutes (do it, its easy) 2) Use them on the Lakefront trail - such a special way to see the Lake and beautiful green area!"
aimeeshreve,"Swartz Creek, Michigan",1,08/21/2016,Disappointing experience/complete waste of money,"I was REALLY excited to rent bikes to ride along the lakeshore with my family. I was willing to go through the hassle of finding a docking station every half hour to ensure we weren't charged penalty fees. However, at our first stop, about 20 minutes into ride, we were unable to retrieve all of our bikes. We had rented 6 bikes and 2 of them would never unlock with the code given. We tried other bikes. There was another group at this station with the same problem. I even tried to purchase additional ride passes but that didn't work either. So, the 4 on bikes rode back to where we started and 2 walked back. I would recommend just renting a bike for a period of time from a business and knowing you'll have it. It may cost a little more, but it's guaranteed to not be a hassle."
MatteoZN,"Desenzano Del Garda, Italy",4,08/19/2016,"Recommended, but can be better ","We highly recommend to use Divvy bikes for visiting Chicago. You really get the most of the city by biking the same for north to south by the coast. The positive about Divvy is that it actually allows you to do that, and it is plenty of stations.The bike status is not the best, specially gear and hand grips. "
RipleyC,Colorado,3,08/16/2016,Divvy Your way to the Game,"If you read the other review some are great some are not. Know what you are getting into. 30 minute windows for 24 hrs. It worked great for us, we had the app, generally knew our way around town. Our biggest plus was going from downtown up to Wrigley and back downtown. However, we got halfway up town in 25 mins so put away the bikes and went to Dairy Queen for 10 mins. We got the same bikes out again and continued on our way. We did encounter stations that didn't have 3 bikes, We did encounter stations that had busted bikes. We did do a fair amount of walking to get to stations at times. A huge plus was the 2 am ride home when it was finally cool enough to ride."
Rachael R,"Bendigo, Australia",5,08/13/2016,Blue Bike Hire,The Divvy Bikes (aka blue bikes)were a fabulous way to get around Chicago. Loved my self tour. 18miles of bike track.
Erin F,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",3,08/07/2016,Convenient but clunky,"Divvy bikes are a great idea in concept, but the bikes could be lighter weight and smoother to ride. In conjunction with the app, it was easy to find the stations and it's a healthy, fun way to see Chicago along the lakefront. The lakefront path can be quite congested, however. We also had an issue at one station where the rack wouldn't release the bike and had to walk to another one. Overall though a great idea!"
all4won,"New York City, New York",1,08/06/2016,DO NOT rent divvy,"Waste of money, waste of time. 1. You must insert credit card at a docking site every 30 minutes to avoid fine print fees. 2. As tourists who don't know the city, good luck finding docking station (the app is useless if you're a tourist) 3. Any Roads with bike lanes were used by cars (very few roads actually had bike lanes-i.e. You have to walk your bike on the sidewalk) 4. Sidewalks too crowded for bikes.5. Dock your bike and slide your credit card for a new bike code and then watch someone walk off with your bike. Now you get to hike all the way to the next docking station. OR have someone stay with your docked bikes as one of you gets a new code. 6. Sketchy detour to get to waterfront path near Navy Pier.7. Spent 98% of the time walking the bike. 8. When you find another station for get a new bike, STAY WITH YOUR BIKE to get a new code. People will steal your bike. The bike must be docked in order to get a new code. 9.What a waste. Walk where you are going. Much faster! You spend your entire 30 minutes searching for a kiosk to avoid fees and keep the $9.95 price. Zero time to leisurely enjoy the waterfront. (Beware: waterfront kiosks will most likely be empty, so guard your bike when you dock for new code or it WILL be taken)  Tips if you still want to do it:TEST BRAKES FIRSTSet watch with a timer of 25 min to avoid fees Ask for printed receipt (your code disappears off the screen VERY quickly) Best tip: Don't do it. "
BATMANCATWOMAN,"Long Island, New York",4,08/04/2016,"LOOKING TO GET AROUND THE CITY, DIVVY BIKES ARE A GOOD CHOCIE",Just like a lot on major cities around the U.S. bikes are becoming the norm and Chicago has it's own to offer. So if you want to get around the city jump on a rental Divvy Bike and enjoy the ride.
Rainbowdops,"New York City, New York",4,08/04/2016,Economical way to bike the lake!,"Ah, I loved the to feel the breeze through my hair as I pedaled along. We had a brilliant time biking on the bike trail along the lakefront. We'd also planned to bike up to Lincoln Park, but the weather had other ideas. The Divvy Bikes seemed to be located all over the city and the pricing scheme made it the cheapest touristy thing we did in The Windy City ($9.95 per bike for 24 hours as long as we returned the bike in 30 minute intervals, but we could check out as many bikes as we wanted within the 24 hour period.) It was brilliant as long as the Divvy Bike rental place you wanted to return your bike to wasn't full (then you'd have to find another spot). Slightly lift the bike to get it out of the docking slot and don't be too gentle when shoving it back in, so it clicks. "
Kim W,"North Reading, Massachusetts",1,08/03/2016,TOURISTS BEWARE! This is a huge scam! Avoid these bikes.,"As you can see from several other reviews, basically you get screwed with the small print. You look & see $9.95 for 24 hours so you rent the bike. What you don't realize is that lower on the kiosk it says that if you don't dock the bike EVERY 30 mins, fees will apply. We rented 2 bikes for 4 hours & I got a $127 charge on my card! When you call CS, they tell you the bikes are made for short commuter trips that take no more than 30 mins. And if you want it for 24 hrs, you have to dock it every 30 mins. Divvy, let me ask you, who would rent a bike for TWENTY FOUR hours if they had to constantly dock it?? It doesn't even make sense. If you have to dock it every 30 mins, then only rent it out for THIRTY MINUTES. As a tourist, you don't know the city, we got lost several times & finally when we saw a docking station, we gave up after 4 hours. Not as easy to bike around a city you don't know as it seems. But we didn't mind since it was only $9.95. WRONG. I called CS and asked for a manager, I spoke with a manager who was very polite & eventually refunded me 50%, which means I got charged $54 for something I thought would cost me $20. I said to him, ""You can't tell me that you don't get this call once or more everyday from other tourists."" And he pretty much agreed it is a huge problem. He's even suggested to Divvy to change their kiosks. Divvy, this is criminal behavior. You need to make your fees MUCH CLEARER. Maybe don't make $9.95 for 24 hrs so bold. You are taking advantage of people who come to rent a bike for a day & get financially taken for a ride as well. Make it clear, Divvy is for LOCALS who want a quick ride. This is not tourist friendly."
Eyeballs,"Gaithersburg, Maryland",2,08/02/2016,Worst. Customer. Service. Ever.,"I ride the bike share all the time in DC and love it. Concept is great. Same concept is great in Chicago too. The big difference is, as a tourist in Chicago, you have to purchase a daily pass. The process is a bit tedious, sliding your credit card in and out at the kiosk each time. Often times you have to do it more than once because the reader cannot process your card. I found several kiosks out of service so you couldn't check out another bike.Then the doozy hit. I docked a bike and walked around a bit in Grant park and grabbed some breakfast early one morning. Went to check out another bike and the kiosk said my bike was still out. Worst. Customer. Service. Ever. Was basically told to go back and find my bike and re-dock it because it wasn't properly docked. Was advised by the Divvy Customer Service rep that she does not work for Divvy so she can't address my account or other issues. Was given the bike number and told to look under the seat.Walked 1/1 mile back to dock. Looked at about 8 bikes until I found the one I docked. It was locked in like a baby. Called customer service again. Same representative. Acted like we had never spoken although it was only 10 minutes prior. How many people had she spoken to on a Tuesday morning at 10am? Rrefreshed her memory and she said 'oh yeah'. Told her bike was docked and gave her the name of the dock. Explained it 3 times, spelled the street. (Where are they located????). She said it looks like dock is offline. When it comes online I will note the bike as docked. So, now what? How do I get a bike? Will I get credit for the time you think my bike is out.... so many unanswerable questions by the woman who doesn't work for Divvy.Suffice it to say, I ended up walking 2 miles back to my hotel because the rep gave me a code that didn't work and I just couldn't handle calling back and talking to her again.God bless and good luck if you rent a Divvy bike and something happens. Waiting for some massive charge to hit my credit card and maybe I'll be lucky enough to talk to the same disinterested, condescending ""I don't work for Divvy"" customer service rep.Oh, an I wrote an email to Divvy customer service, the email address on their website. Wait for it... No response.It would be a 1, except the concept is a good idea. I pity the fool with an offline dock."
Michelle L,"Atlanta, GA",5,07/30/2016,"Great way to get around the city, and lake","As a tourist this was a great way to do the Lakefront Trail and to see the city. Chicago seems to be one of the few cities that has bike lanes where you can actually fit and not have the fear of being ran over. Only problem is that sometimes it could be difficult to find a place to drop off your bike within 30 minutes (if doing the all day pass) due to sometimes the bike rack being full. Also, it would be nice after downloading the app you could get reminders to drop off your bike, or even have a place for your phone so you can follow the gps to your destination. Overall, we had a great experience."
smashley3284,,3,07/25/2016,"Overall Great, Some Annoyances","While Divvy bikes are a great concept for those who live in Chicago, for those of us traveling through/visiting, there were some annoyances that I tried to look past. I downloaded the app to my phone, bought the $9.95 day pass, but was told halfway through the day that I hadn't purchased said pass. So then I had to re-purchase a pass using the same exact credit card and ultimately had to dispute the second charge to the CC company.Since Divvy bikes are for ""short trips"", you have to dock the bike every 30 mins to avoid being charged. We tried setting an alarm for every 25 mins so we could find a Divvy station to re-dock the bike and go through the whole process all over again of retrieving an unlock code, or you risk being charged for going over. There is, of course, an option to add on more time by paying more when purchasing your day-pass. Since I was trying to save on cash, this is why we chose to dock (or at least try to dock) every thirty minutes. Half-way though the day, we just gave up and said screw it, and just kept the bikes for however long we needed it. It was better to enjoy our time that way instead of worrying we couldn't find the next station.Most of the bikes were rideable, some had obvious signs of wear-and-tear, some we couldn't take out because they were reported as ""damaged"" (and therefore you cannot unlock said bike). I would have liked to see a basket on the front and someplace to keep my water bottle secure. There is a little bungee cord on the front so you can place something there, but it won't fit anything as large as a backpack.Yes, I would use these again. Yes, I would purchase more time when I buy the day pass. Ultimately, you get a good view of the city by bike, a good workout, and it's better than Chicago having no bikes at all!"
msaraa,,4,07/25/2016,Quick trip ,"I gave it a 4 only because the seats aren't comfortable enough to be riding all day. By the end of the day we couldn't tolerate the soreness. I couldn't imagine trying to use the bikes for more than a day unless your butt gets used to it. On the other hand, it was such a nice way to get around and make quick trips. You also get to explore more of the city this way. Very easy to access with the app (transit). "
273brandond,"Saint Louis, Missouri",1,07/25/2016,Poor Service,"Went to the kiosk to get two bikes. My friend just before me got a bike for himself. However, when I tried it would not allow me to get the bikes. I tried three different cards, one of which was the same as my friends. When we called customer service, they said there was nothing they could do."
DeniseB866,"New Iberia, Louisiana, United States",5,07/25/2016,So Awesome!,Traffic has been very accommodating to my lack of bike riding skills - Coming from a small southern town in Louisiana where we have no public transportation much less bike lanes it was a little scary at first ... And I haven't ridden a bike in OMG maybe 30 years!! I'm still figuring the bike system out - but seems like the most economical way to get around and a lot of fun. I find the transit map a little confusing but it could be me!! I stop and ask for help - everyone is so nice! Be patient and bike on
BoBromhal,"Raleigh, North Carolina",5,07/24/2016,Best way to explore the city,"If you're physically able, a $10 daily Divvy bike is an awesome way to explore the city. The downside is you can only keep them for 30 minutes at a time, but it wasn't as daunting after our first 30 minute segment spent riding up the lakeside path. Download the Transit App (as of this version, it's green and like a sideways S) which tracks EVERY version of public transportation but is great for the Divvy. Not only does it show all of the numerous bike stations, but it keeps track of how many bikes are available. So, you grab your day permit, it gives you a simple code, unshackle a bright blue Divvy, and off you go exploring. There are plenty of bike stations in the downtown area, no more than 5 blocks apart I'd guess. And bike lanes everywhere. And downtown is not very hilly at all. The best thing is you can turn in a Divvy at one end of a neighborhood, stroll a few blocks enjoying the city, then you use the same credit card as your membership to get a new code and a new bike. One word to the wise - downtown is full of cars, taxis, users, city buses, tour buses, and especially pedestrians. If you're not a confident bike rider, use caution on the busiest roads, like Michigan Ave! "
JosephW_abq,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",5,07/23/2016,Vacation Chicago 2016,"My wife and I enjoyed an evening out with a nice bike ride. We rode from our hotel (Drake) to the Navy Pier. We are both in are 50s and don't ride bikes back home but had no problems with these bikes, as they are easy to use and has easy shifting of gears. You do need to find the drop of locations at the places you ride to that gave us a little trouble but overall it was a fun experience. "
Starr M,,1,07/21/2016,WAs way over charged for a 4 hour ride even though we paid for 24 hrs,"We visited Chicago and figured the best way to see the city and not fight parking was to bike. We got home and for renting 3 bikes for 4 hours we were charged $150. We could have used to tour bus and boats for that price!!! They scam you saying you rent a bike for 24 hrs for $9.95 but if you dont spend every 30 min searching for a new bike station to put it up, re-insert your card, get a new code and bike you get over charges. Who spends their whole day sight seeing going terminal to terminal? WILL NEVER USE AGAIN!!"
joinville,florida,5,07/20/2016,So easy to use!,"We rented the bikes for the daily fee, and rode along the lake trail, very user friendly, all the docking stations were close enough to each other so we avoided extra fees by docking every 30 min. The bikes rode nicely, brakes worked well, adjustable seats, and bells!!! A very pleasant way to explore the lake trail in Chicago."
Padamescu,,3,07/18/2016,Lots of fun with a big surprise!,"I loved the convenience of being able to rent a pair of bikes for $10/day! We rode bikes all day for about 7 hours. We stopped once to have a great lunch at the grand lux. Perfect! Couldn't believe what a great deal we had. Here's the big surprise!!! Noticed on my bank statement my charge was $143! I called to let them know a mistake was made, but surprise, no mistake. Turns out the $20/day for the pair was just so you could ride the bikes for up to 30 minutes at a time (you could swap for another bike at another location). Since we kept the same bikes for hours we accrued penalties. I asked to see if they could waive some of the fees to no avail. I felt bad that I misunderstood the policy since I am usually pretty savvy, but am posting this as a cautionary tail for future travelers. "
Michael D,,1,07/12/2016,Rip Off - Divvy has no standards or policies or management,"I have used divvy for over a year, and have been generally content with the experience.HOWEVER, one night a divvy station was down for some reason, so the bikes were not locking into the dock. My friend and I both did our best to dock them and then immediately notified customer service of the issue. Later on we were both charged $75 for the time our bikes were ""out"". We both requested a refund because the issue was not our fault and we had notified Divvy. My friend easily received his refund, but after a dozen emails and calls I was denied a refund. Somehow Divvy is treating two identical situations in different ways. I am speechless at how awful this experience has been."
educampbell,"Chicago, Illinois",5,07/11/2016,Lakefront Route,"Awesome experience, we took a 14 mile trek along the lakefront and was able to seamlessly return and check out the same bike on a Saturday morning from 9-12 PM. I could see myself using Divvy for several other experiences when visiting the city of Chicago. I was surprised at how well the gears shifted (turn right hand grip forward or backward to shift gears), the light weight feel and the handling. It had no problem keeping up with a $700 Trek bicycle..."
Garguilo85,"Beachwood, New Jersey",5,07/06/2016,"Easy, Fun & Fast","First experience using city bikes. The Divy was easy to use, fast and fun. You can spend the whole day using the bikes for only $10. We saw all of Chicago on the bikes bc it's a bike friendly city. I strongly recommend this. And you can use your phone to make it even easier."
Dana K,"Chicago, Illinois",2,07/06/2016,Misleading Policy; Day Pass = 30 minute trips ONLY,"Please note this is a ""commuter service"". Charges are COMPLETELY MISLEADING at the kiosk. A ""Day Pass"" only allows you to use a bike FOR 30 MINUTES. After that you pay overage charges. Good for a quick trip to get somewhere, but forget riding along the lake or stopping for lunch. We rented 2 bikes, rode along the lake and stopped for lunch. Had 2 bikes for one hour and 45 minutes. Cost us $50."
momofllama,"Ham Lake, Minnesota",1,07/05/2016,Horrible,"To rent the bikes is easy. However, we thought we would have a 24 hour rental for the $20 fee. BUT...what they don't tell you is that you have to ""check it in"" every 30 minutes in order to avoid overage charges. So, getting on the bike is easy but then once you have biked for a while, we were in a panic to get to another bike station so that we wouldn't get charged. We had to put the bike back, and then get another bike code to ride for another 30 minutes. Wouldn't do it again."
klixxy,"Chicago, Illinois",2,07/05/2016,No more divvying for us!,"Rented four bikes. The first 3 bikes released fine - we were on phone for 10 minutes until other was solved-released. Next day - we tried getting two of the four bikes (within the 24 hours). Again just one released and was back on phone with Divvy, twice. You get charged for this. The station at Navy Pier had no kiosk and the divvy station at McClurg had no available spots to park. Plus side - the bikes are a nice ride. Frustration not worth the $$$$. "
Curt O,"Chicago, Illinois",1,07/05/2016,Small print schemes,"Hello. I recently took a Divvy ride down the Lake Shore trail in Chicago. This is a ride that takes a couple hours to do, depending on your speed and your distance. In any case, Divvy charges by the half hour. When going to pay the $10 for the 24 hour pass, the machines explicitly indicated the price. However, in the fine print section of the screens, they include a clause that indicates that one must dock the bike every 30 minutes, presumably for some sort of ""check in"". I did not see this clause as it was discreetly hidden in the fine print and received a bill for $80 the next day. This is not really acceptable for tourists in that they must pretty much be going station-to-station and checking in every half hour, rather than enjoying the ride and beautiful weather that Chicago boasts in the summertime. Also, it's a bit dangerous having to check every destination point in a city that may not be familiar to tourists. In the end, I was not helped by customer service neither by email nor telephone as the fine print pricing was much more accurate than the deceptive large print pricing that misleads customers as to really knowing how long to expect their rides to be. Don't be surprised if it happens that you get an incredibly expensive bill with conditions that are included in print like a Ponzi scheme."
brenbri,"buffalo, ny",3,07/01/2016,Not that bad,"Decided to try the bikes on a recent trip from Lake View to McCormick. The price is reasonable and the bikes were in good shape. It was easy to access them. You don't have to worry about locking them as you simply drop them in a station when you are close to where you want to spend time. I would say that the app is a must. If you do not visit a Divvy station every thirty minutes, the costs will pile on. But the app does a good job reminding you when there is 5 mins left and points you to the next closest station. When you do return to a station to reset the 30 minute clock, simply reinsert the bike into the station and dip the same credit card you used to get the bikes. There machine gives you a new release code and you are good for another 30 minutes. Also, if you get to a station and there are no empty spots, you simply dip your card and it gives you an extra 15 mins. All in all, it was an affordable way to get around the city and if you don't mind having to stop every 30 minutes, it's worth it!!"
FSYMP,"Mt Prospect, IL",5,06/28/2016,How to get the most of your Divvy experience,"Divvy is a great way to see Chicago. Pick your bike here and leave it there. All that for $9.95 for 24 hours + trip fees. The first 30 minutes are free and the first 60 minutes cost $2. After that you are getting into bigger bucks, e.g. 90 minutes for $6.To stop the clock you need to dock your bike at any station. And you can check out the very same bike that you just checked in.- To check out a bike. Since time is money, get the bike ready first: adjust the seat height, put your items in the front basket... Then enter your code. If you plan to ride with someone, enter your code simultaneously. Once you get a green light, the easiest way to undock a bike is to lift it up by its saddle.- To check it in. First verify the station you want to go to has empty docks via the Divvy app. Once you are at an empty dock, roll the bike in and lift slightly the handlebar until you see the green light on the left side of the dock station. That's CRITICAL. If the bike is not checked in correctly, the clock is still running and you will not be able to check out another bike.- 30 free minutes Vs. $2 for 60 minutesIt may be a better deal to pay $2 and get 60 minutes of riding than try to dock every 30 minutes. 60 minutes give you more range and allow you to get to your real destination. Of course, if you see a Divvy station along the way, dock your bike by all means. To get the most value, map your route first even before checking out any bike. The Divvy app can help you do that.- Practice docking/undocking Since the first 30 minutes are free, hold down your horses and spend 5 minutes to practice docking and undocking at your very first station. Then take off.- Last but not least do not ride on sidewalks. It is against the law, annoys pedestrians and gives Divvy a bad rap.Keep these tips in mind while you are enjoying your rides around town(s). In Summer 2016 Divvy is expanding to Oak Park & Evanston."
U204TPmarcoa,"Guadalajara, Mexico",5,06/27/2016,Super convenient!,"Ir you want to know Chicago do it on a Divvy, what a great service and an easy and reliable app to rent them for a day, I did all my trip on the bikes, always found a station nearby and never had a problem."
Halugen,"Yucca Valley, California",1,06/26/2016,Be forewarned about this company!,"Be warned that 9.95 for 24 hours does not mean you get the bike for 24 hours! You only get it for 30 minutes before you have to redock it, and recheck it out otherwise you get charged overage fees! Sure this is explained on the website and/or app, but it is not well explained if you just show up and rent a bike on the fly. Our family rented bikes (4 of them) and got hit with very hefty overage fees because this wasn't well explained at the kiosk. So hopefully others will read this and be forewarned!"
illinoistravelere,,3,06/12/2016,Are you on a budget or tight schedule?  Then you might not wish to use Divvy Bikes,"It SOUNDS like a great idea, but..........beware.  You must re-dock every 30 minutes, or incur an additional charge.  If a station is full, you'll have to bike to the next closest one.   Or the next closest one after that.  And so on......."
110laram,,1,06/10/2016,Horrible!!!,Great concept horrible executuon!!!  Stations not working customer service not helpful. Ruined our day walking trying to fund a working station!
819mattc,"Ripon, United Kingdom",5,06/07/2016,Excellent way to get around,"Ok, it's a bit of a hassle to set up the system but persevere as the bikes are a great way to get around and see the sights. I cycled from the conference centre all along the lake from to the top of the magnificent mile in less than 30min. Then took another bike later up to Lincoln Park along the lake shore. The bikes are easy to ride, in good condition and there is a really good map on line which shows the network of cycle paths. "
Lucretia P,Turks and Caicos,4,06/04/2016,Biking in Chicago,"We had a lot of fun biking along the lake shore on our recent trip to Chicago. I want to caution others to be careful about the return of their bikes. It can be tricky to get your bike locked in so the time meter stops. I had a charge of over $110.00 on my debit account when I got home, for less than two hours of biking. I called the company and to their credit they did give me a partial refund."
Campingcameron,,1,06/01/2016,Bummer! Broken Pay Machine!,"When trying to pay and have a ride outside the Shed Aquarium, we were told the payment machine was broken, AND when the gentleman involved called to ask for help, he was told they, the company, could not do anything! We will try to ""Bike and Roll"" closer to our hotel tomorrow! Sounds like fun!!"
malvina05,"Chicago, Illinois",1,05/23/2016,It's a RIP OFF!!! You might as well buy a bike for this price!,It's such a rip off and the pricing is not very clearly stated. We thought that we would pay $9.95 for the 24 hour pass plus $8 to not have to keep docking it every 30min. Wow were we wrong! It's 9.95 plus $8 if you have it for up to 90min plus $8 for each additional 30min. My card was charged $63 for couple hours of divvy. DO NOT USE IT!
nancy K,"Chicago, Illinois",1,05/11/2016,"Avoid the Nightmare of Renting a Divvy Bike, can be costly and very frustrating!!!","We tried to use a Groupon on 3 bikes and what a nightmare for several reasons: The system to check out bikes is too lengthy even without the Groupon. I could only use 1 credit card for each bike, therefore I used 3 credit cards, then not knowing which is for what bike. The touch screen you have to input all the information is not touch sensitive, so you end up reentering and pushing harder for all the information it is asking you, several screens to go through, while a line is forming behind you. At the end of trying to rent 3 bikes it took us almost the 30 minutes to get the bikes only to have to re dock the bikes at the same station, yet we would have to wait in the line of disgruntled customers after we took so long. 30 minutes for anyone whether a commuter and especially for a tourist which it seems to attract is way too short. Plus we ended up getting charged over $30 on each credit card for keeping the bikes for 2 hours, since we wanted to avoid the nightmare of having to re dock them every 30 minutes due to the confusion of 3 credit cards and a line of people at the stations. Also there are not always even bikes or dock slots open. So, if you are a tourist for the day in Chicago, we recommend avoid the DIVVY bikes due to the fact of long time to go through the screens and it doesn't take all credit cards and the time limit of 30 minutes, you really only have 20 minutes once you get going to find the next nightmare dock. They are not helpful in refunding either. This is not the only poor experience we have had so be warned to stay away from DIVVY until they improve their customer service in many aspects."
ProfDave,Seattle,4,04/20/2016,Handy way to get around,"We found Divvy a convenient way to get around the Chicago lakefront. The bicycles are standard bikeshare 3-speeds: heavy and slow but functional. We rode them from the Field Museum to the Art Institute, then up the lakefront to the beginning of the Magnificent Mile. Chicago drivers seemed pretty tolerant of bikes but it is a busy city so it helps to be comfortable biking in traffic. You are not supposed to bike on the sidewalk. The lakefront path is a very pleasant ride.The key to bikeshare is to use them for point-to-point travel of less than 30 minutes, not a leisurely bike ride, as the charges increase after 30 min. It's also a very good idea to download the app as it'll tell you where the docking stations are located - and importantly whether there are any available bikes or open spots to dock. The dock closest to the Art Institute was full in the early afternoon on Friday so we had to find the next closest, a couple of blocks away."
Jodi D,"Minocqua, Wisconsin",5,03/23/2016,Loved this!!,"At first I was a bit intimidated on how to use this but was actually very easy. Unfortunately, your not allowed to ride on the sidewalks and we actually got yelled at in Millenium park for riding the bikes. Once we discovered the bike trails along the lakewalk we were hooked. We were easily able to get around and dock our bikes close to every location we wanted to visit including the Navy Pier and all the museums. My teenage son loved it! "
Cameron J,"Iowa City, Iowa",1,03/19/2016,This was a bad idea,"My wife and I and another couple were visiting Chicago and decided to take a nice bike ride down the coast. We parked by a station with some open bikes, and were excited to check them out. To our dismay, we learned that you are charged extra for every half hour you have the bikes checked out. So we came up with a plan to stop and switch out bikes every half hour or so since you are not charged extra. This worked at first, but was a huge pain and instead of being able to take a nice ride, we were biking as fast as we could to get to the next station. We stopped after about an hour to go check out the beach and left our bikes at the station. After spending a few minutes there, we decided to head back, this time deciding that we wouldn't stop along the way so that we could enjoy the ride. But this time, the machine wouldn't read either of our credit cards. We called customer service and they just told us to walk to the next station. We were pretty annoyed about this since we only paid for two hours of parking and needed to get back. But we walked to the next station anyway. Once we got there, it read my credit card, but said we still had a bike checked out! We called customer service again, and they told us we had to go BACK to the last station to check on the bike, even though we had all checked our bikes and made sure they were secure. So one of us headed to the car, while the rest of us had to go back to the station. Long story short, our 2 hour leisurely bike ride turned into a one hour bike race down the coast followed by another hour and a half of walking back and forth. The machines didn't work, the customer service basically couldn't do anything about it, and they offered no refunds or compensation. If you're on a timetable or a budget, these are a bad idea."
FitnessTravelers,,5,03/07/2016,Excellent Way To Get Around,"I'm a chicago bike commuter. I have  been happy using Divvy bike system for 2 years! Annual membership very affordable. Excellent way to get around and see the city! Upgraded this past year with increased 
bikes/docks for areas north and south of downtown."
Kilgore_Trout_88,"Phoenix, Arizona",4,10/28/2015,Fun but Beware of the Fee Options,We rented the Divvy Bikes when we visited Chicago. We bought the 24 hr pass and thought that allowed us unlimited use. Only to find that only the first 30 minutes of each segment is free and after that there are per hour charges. So our 2 hour ride ended up costing us $45 (which I didn't know until the credit card bill came). I should have taken more time to read all the fee options at the Kiosk. We rode along the lake and it was really beautiful - nice trail for bikes.
Legamania,"Denver, Colorado",4,10/14/2015,"Good System, But Be Prepared & Do Your Homework!","This was my wife's & my first time using a public-share bike system and we really enjoyed it. Primarily we used it along the lake shore and not downtown itself (we didn't feel safe riding on the streets with so much traffic). In general the bikes were comfortable, easy to use and in good working condition. With that being said you really need to be prepared and do your homework. Once you pay your $10 +/- you can use the bikes all day but only in 30 minute intervals. True, this can be a challenge (that's how they make their $) so you have to know where you're going and if there is a station(s) along the way. I strongly recommend checking out their website and reviewing their policies, maps & videos before using this system. I also downloaded their mobile app which had an interact map showing all of their bike station locations. I've read some complaints saying that the app showed a station only to find, upon arriving to that location, there was no station there. We never had that problem. However like other reviewers have commented, we have rode our bikes to stations only to find that there were no bikes available to use (for example - aquarium, planetarium, museums, pier, etc. / typically in the afternoon & evening when everyone is looking for a way ""home"" from the touristy spots). It was no problem for us since we didn't put ourselves in that situation of relying on a bike to get home from the popular destinations. Since we already had bikes we simply checked our bike back in at the next station, got a new 30-minute use code and rode our bikes to the next station along our route. Once you get the system down it's a lot of fun and a great way to see the Chicago sites!"
pritchjeff,"Newtown, Connecticut",1,10/11/2015,Doesn't work,Walked 15 minutes to Divvy bike rack and there were no bikes available. Walked 15 minutes to the next Divvy bike rack and after entering information on the touch screen it reset and went back to the beginning. Did this twice and hailed a cab.
GeV64,"Vantaa, Finland",4,10/09/2015,A great way to move about in Chicagos,I rented Divvy bikes instead of taking a hop-on-hop-off bus tour. I'm glad I did. I could visit all the same places a bus would have visited and could choose my own routes. I especially enjoyed riding up the lakefront. There are lots of docking stations all around. Docking a bike every 30 minutes can be a bit annoying but even without pre-planning I managed to find a new docking station within 30 minutes. I browsed through different areas of the city with my iPad and the iPhone app when connected to a wifi network and the app showed the docking stations even when offline. The Android app didn't.
FLflipflops,"Orlando, Florida",5,10/05/2015,Easy and Awesome!,This is such a fantastic city feature! My husband and I really enjoyed biking throughout the city. Used them all day and night. A huge savings and a great way to see the city; you miss so much riding in a car. The only minor hiccup came when biking to Soldier Field to check it out and tailgate. We weren't familiar with the area and spent 30-40 minutes trying to get an open dock. Little did we know that right in front of the field (Field Museum) they had employees taking all extra bikes to free up docks for return. I wish that notice came up when selecting that a nearby dock was full and you were re-routed.
2thdr63119,St Louis,4,09/29/2015,Easy Bikes,"The Divvy Bikes were a great addition to our weekend plans in Chicago. They were easy to rent, easy to return and easy to ride.  I will look for these bikes on future trips to Chicago."
HSTTraveler,"Chicago, Illinois",3,09/24/2015,"Excellent Concept, Below Average Implementation","The title of the review sums this service up pretty well. Exciting opportunity to have access to bikes in locations throughout Chicago. Reasonable cost to rent, apps make finding stations easy and finding safe bike lanes simple. The apps do tell you where bikes are and how many are at the station, but at rush times the bikes can be cleared out (if you are looking for one) or stations filled (if you'd like to return one) for the location you want and all the surrounding ones. During special events they have staff at locations like the lakefront or train stations, but those are rare. I just am not sure if a city of Chicago run entity or any entity for that matter can fully implement this concept effectively. The amount of staff it might require to truly pay attention to all the stations might be cost prohibitive. In the end, I use it as it is ""fun"" and beats walking, just be prepared to be frustrated 30-40% of the time if you can find a bike or get rid of one when and where you want to."
tweety874,"Bartlett, Illinois",1,09/23/2015,Never got to ride!!,We tried 3 times at one station and after going through all the prompts (the last one with customer service on the line) we could not get it to work. He told us to walk to the next station and try there. Same thing. Customer service not helpful. The system definitely needs work!! With all the time wasted we could have walked to our destination faster without the hassle.
robertfN527ZE,Dorset,5,09/11/2015,A great way to see the area,"A great and economical way to see the area. There are numerous places to pick up and return these bikes so you don't incur extra costs by going over 30 minutes. You just return the bike to one of the many sites, get a new pin from the machine and take 2 more. If you download the free app it has a timer, a map of the docking sites and how many bikes available. Would use it again!"
rhhenneCrownPoint_IN,"Crown Point, Indiana",4,09/09/2015,Great rides along the lake front,Used the bikes 3 times while we were in Chicago. It was labor day weekend so many people were visiting downtown. To get a bike takes quite a few screens to get through so long lines were forming every station we went to. They did have Divvy people there to help but still long lines.
Emily J,"London, United Kingdom",3,09/09/2015,Good if you can find a bike.,"We decided to use the Divvy bikes instead of renting one as A.) It's so much cheaper and B.) We didn't want the bike for that long.The 24 hour pass is $9.95 but you must check your bike in at a check point every 30 minutes to avoid an additional charge (however the charge isn't too bad and still works out cheaper than renting a bike if you happen to go over the time limit.) The first day we used a Divvy bike our closest point was empty, so we walked about 4 blocks to the next point where there were very few bikes left. We jumped on and rode along the lake to Lincoln Park which was lovely. Due to the very hot, humid weather we couldn't bare riding back so hopped on a bus and decided we'd do an evening bike ride later on.In the evening we walked to 3 Divvy bike stops and all were empty, making the $9.95 seem a bit pointless for a 30 minute ride out of 24 hours. Thankfully at the weekend they were offering free 24 hours passes, we located a Divvy Stand but the 2 bikes remaining were broken, so walked to another 3 stops and on the 4th stop finally got a bike! Overall, if you can get a bike and only want it to get to A - B then this is a great way of getting about. It's so much cheaper than renting a bike, however the having to check it in every 30 minutes really takes the fun out as you have to keep clock watching. We did really enjoy riding the bikes and there are plenty of Divvy stands around to check the bike in, but well located stands tend to have no bikes resulting in a long walk to actually get one. I'd definitely use it for a lake front ride but anything more can be a bit of a drag and make sure you do your research to locate a Divvy stand to check your bike into after the 30 minutes!!!I think 30 minutes is too little, even if it got upped to a 45 minute ride it would help a lot more!"
TracyH79,"Lawrence, Kansas",4,09/07/2015,Lots of fun!,"We took advantage of the free Saturday promotion and thoroughly enjoyed riding bikes along the lakefront. As long as you do your research and understand the process, it's a great service. The system was slow but I expect that was due to increased demand. The only station we had trouble at was Navy Pier were all docks were full and our time was running out. No worries, we added time and found two other stations nearby which led us to discovering a restaurant we would otherwise have missed and thoroughly enjoyed. I wouldn't have paid the full price times a family of four given that we'd already paid for CTA passes but with the free promo, I'm glad we took advantage of it!"
Val96712,"Corpus Christi, Texas",1,09/03/2015,"NOT FOR TOURISTS, They will rip you off","The $9.95 for a 24 hour bike ride cost $132!!!!! Called to dispute the charges and was informed that they are NOT FOR TOURISTS They are for a 30 minute bike ride to get you from point A to point B. (Even though the website says differently) Do not use to enjoy the city.What they do is charge you in 30 minute incriments, anything over your initial 30 minutes, youre charged $8 for each 30 minute period. It will take you that long to find the next parking hub. Complete rip off! The bikes cost as much as my car rental! I called to ask if there was hidden charges and they said no, they're liars and scammers looking to benefit off of tourists! DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT USE!!"
mikem149,"Sugar Grove, Illinois",3,09/01/2015,More than meets the eye!,"I think the bikes are great, but all the other crap you have to do to use them really drags down the experience. We rented the bikes at Navy Pier for my family of 4. After a modest 5 minute wait in line, it was our turn at the kiosk. Surprise #1. You can only rent 2 bikes per credit card! Thank god my wife brought her purse and we had a second one on us. After all that confusion, we then got our 2nd surprise of the day. Surprise#2. You have to ""check in"" at a bike station every 30 minutes or there is a penalty-which essentially means you can't go anywhere you want, but must map out your journey so you strategically go by a Divvy bike station every 30 minutes. The bikes were solid, well maintained. Would of rated this experience higher if it wasn't for all this other stuff. I wish I could of. "
riduk,"Dallas, Texas",2,08/30/2015,Probably Not Worth It,"if you don't have a smart phone with GPS, AVOID! You won't be able to find the stations (which are often tucked away from the main interesections where they are posted to be on the map). which often malfunction or are full where you want to go. "
Bea_613,"Ottawa, Canada",1,08/23/2015,Deceptive marketing,"Seven of us visited Chicago. We stayed downtown and planned to bike to the Lincoln Zoo along the lake. Divvy bikes was recommended by the hotel. It took us a few phone calls and several tries to unlock the bikes. After 20 minutes we finally left the station. Being from out of the country we had never used this system and selected the $9.95 day pass - someone in our group said it may be an additional $2 for the second hour. To my dismay, I was charged $107.78 (Cdn) on my VISA for 2 bikes for just over 2 hours. My sister had the same charge and my other sister was only charged $9.95. Customer service was not friendly and said the charges are clearly listed on the website - which I only saw a week after the fact, however it is very complicated to figure out. In addition, the site mentioned that you had to take the bike to a docking station every 30 minutes - but it took us very long to check the bikes out in the first place and we did not notice any stations while riding north along the lake. There should be a limit on the amount charged and a warning to tourists not to rent Divvy bikes. The only cost that was CLEARLY advertised was the $9.95/day pass. I assume the city must make a lot of money from people unfamiliar with this service."
MAR154914,"Edmonton, Canada",4,08/18/2015,Wheels on tour!,"In Chicago with the teenagers for the week and found the divvy bikes a great way to get around. Divvy bikes are the blue bikes for rent all around the city. For $9.95 per 24 hours, you can zip all around. One limitation is the 30 minute limit per bike trip or you get dinged with extra charges. You need to trade in the bike at the next divvy stand before the 30 minutes is up and check out another bike (all on the original fee). Lots of stations in key sightseeing spots so not to worry. We stayed at a large hotel on Michigan Ave and found that the 30 minutes was fine for a ride to the Museum or Millennium Park or around the beaches. No problem and the kids liked the freedom to explore. And you know that teenagers are hard to please!"
Theresa413,"Fort Pierce, Florida",5,08/13/2015,Great for locals and visitors too!,"During my recent visit to Chicago my daughters and I rented the Divvy bikes. We enjoyed biking the city, around the lake and to the parks. One of my daughters lives in Chicago. Her and her fiance love to rent the Divvy's for a weekend bike ride. It's great for visitors to the area as well, easy to navigate through the city and drop at one of the stations while site seeing. I highly recommend trying Divvy bikes and wish I had come up with the idea!"
LisaCARH,"Birmingham, Alabama",4,08/13/2015,So easy and fun!,This is a terrific way to get around town.  There are so many options available.  We had a blast.  Combine the bikes with CTA and you can really see a lot of chicago in a short amount of time!
gasdad,"Woonsocket, Rhode Island",5,08/10/2015,Easy to use bike rental,"This is the first time that I have used a city bike share service.  It is very easy to use & Chicago is the best city to try this out.  The endless bike paths make you feel safe, especially for an occasional bike rider."

I downloaded the app so as I travelled, I knew where the nearest bike drop was. You are limited to a 30 minute segment on the bike before you have to dock it. You can take time out away from the bike and then reapply for a new code to take out a different bike. Lots of fun."
pantone808,chicago,4,08/08/2015,Affordable Bikesharing in Chicago,"Divvy is Chicago's bike sharing system, if you are familiar with other cities systems, this should be easy for you. Check their website and other reviews here for more info. Basic common sense and some planning can help. Bring a helmet, find a bike that fits your height before unlocking it, then you don't have to adjust it, however it's fairly easy to raise or lower most seats. Test that first before unlocking. There are no drink holders, but a thick bungee cord for holding a bag in front. Make sure the your valuables are very secure, as I had a bag slip thru while biking. Always make sure you have a destination station in mind, and a plan B if it's full. You can check online to see what's open, but it can be unpredictable. I always make sure to have several spots open at destination station before I depart. We've encountered a problem returning a bike once, due to faulty mechanism. Things happen, so if you have a plan B, you don't have to worry about it. In general the bikes are comfortable and sturdy if a bit heavy. They have gears and are easy to ride. Obey safe biking laws, and try to use the bike lanes. Make sure to time your trip, to accommodate 30 min. limit. There are plenty of stations so you can bike and stop to explore the city with ease and convenience. Join Divvy for small yearly fee or take advantage of a day pass. I surprised my husband with a mystery biking adventure all planned with various divvy locations. I now use Divvy exclusively for around town biking, the convenience saves me from lugging my heavy bike down 2 flights of stairs."
Surf2lv,"Raleigh, North Carolina",1,08/05/2015,Good if your up for a scavenger hunt,"I called customer support after finding out I was supposed to dock every 30 minutes. I wanted to see what they charged and if it could be waived. I purchased the 24 hour pass and had the bike for 4 hours and the overage fees somehow were $62. This does not seem fair or reasonable. Customer service would not do anything, so I asked to speak to speak to a supervisor. She thought the fee was within reason, but agreed to reduce it to half. She said that the only way to get it fully waived is to email support. The overage fee and charges are very misleading. Had I known it was this much I would have rented a bike for $23."
mattb185,"Kansas City, Missouri",5,08/05/2015,What an Adventure! ,"We rented this for the last couple days that we were in Chicago. I wish that we had tried it sooner. The premise is fairly self-explanatory. There are numerous spots around the city to rent these bicycles. Most are no more than a 15 minute ride apart from each other. Many are much less. For less than $10 for a 24 hour period, you can use these an unlimited amount of times. The only caveat is that you must check in at a station every 30 minutes and request a new code if you want to ride longer. We use this time limit to plan our day. We used the wonderful app on our phones to find where we wanted to go and where the closest station was at. The only time that we ever ran into an issue, was when the stations were completely full. In this case, you request a 15 minute extension for no charge and ride to the next station. We were able to get through town with ease, and saved numerous taxi trips. The bikes are well-maintained, and comfortable. This was a great way to ride along the lake and enjoy the weather."
Paul L,"Tel Aviv, Israel",1,08/02/2015,Complete waste of time and money.,"My wife and I spent 24hrs in Chicago and we thought that this would be a great way to see the city, We signed up for 2 24hr passes. While there is no shortage of stations and bikes, in practice most of the stations were not functioning. Sometimes we manged to take a single bike and the second code for releasing the bike would not work. I ended up running behind my wife while she rode. We met many other frustrated bikers with the same problems.My suggestion is to use the excellent public transportation or to find a bike rental company run by humans!"
vp050176,"Charlestown, Indiana",5,07/29/2015,Great attraction,"This is a great way to see the downtown area of Chicago. You spend 9.95 for a 24 hour period. you can keep the bike for a 30 min ride, find a station to park it, then go on another 30 min ride. There are stations all over the downtown area. we rode from our hotel in river north to navy pier then back. Bikes were in great shape, and easy to ride."
854feritg,,1,07/28/2015,Terrible Experience,"Their policies are deceiving.  They are completely unhelpful on the phone and most of their stations were not functioning.  I would not recommend them at all.  Stay away, just rent a regular bike with real people."
Whityadm,"Clarksville, Tennessee",3,07/27/2015,Good idea,"We had a great time getting around with the bikes but sadly had a very bad experience which got us of using Divvy Bikes. We went to go to Navy Pier and the station was full but a representative from Divvy was there to check the bikes in anyway. We trusted her putting in the information and taking the bikes. A few days later we check the bank account and they charged us for full day use, even though we only took the bikes from the station were we stayed to Navy Pier, which is about 15mins. We called to get our money back because the bill was over $100. They said it is our problem because we can't proof that we actually dropped of the bikes at that time. In the end we got some of it refunded but not all. We guess the lady forgot to press a button or whatever. We recommend to always put them in the station and make sure it locked. Otherwise it is a great way to get around town and a great idea."
Karen G,"Joliet, Illinois",5,07/27/2015,Go Divvy!,My daughter and I rented Divvy bikes during our recent stay in Chicago for a convention. I was a little nervous at first about the 30 minute docking but there really were enough docks to check in / out every 30 minutes. We ended up renting the bikes 3 times and docked a couple times each time in a 24 hour period so the price was great for the amount of use we got out of it.
lesliekaplan,"Jacksonville, Florida",5,07/26/2015,There are Tricks,"You must be 16 to rent a bike and you can only rent 2 bikes per credit card, so you need to plan ahead if you come with a family. We brought just our 8 year old's bike, planing to rent for the rest of us so we didn't have so many bikes on the car for our cross country trip. We also brought our own helmets. The other thing to know is that it is $9.95 for a 24 hour pass, but if any trip is longer than 30 min, you get charged more so you need to plan to take several short trips. We loved going on the lakefront path, but it was tricky to find. There is a cyclefinder app to help find the bikes and also a timer to help avoid the exra charges, and Google maps has a way to turn on bike paths, to help plot the best routes. We went from the south side to the Art Institute, Navy Pier, Lincoln Park, and Chinatown all on bikes. Great way to cover a lot of ground without parking and also getting some exercise!"
Kevin H,"North Port, Florida",1,07/19/2015,Great concept - poor execution,The concept is great and easy. The execution is flawed.Our experience was on a Friday. The third station we initially visited finally had bikes (we even had the app - which was nice but not up to date). After riding for 30 minutes found station was full. I hit the button indicating 'full station' but that didn't work. Found another station and got the overtime fee but able to exchange bikes.Got to next station and again full station and unable to exchange bikes - many people trying to get bikes but card reader not working.Basically if you get to a full station - you are in trouble because the card reader is not working to allow people to take/exchange bikes. All you can do is return them until station is full.I would have paid more to have 1 or 2 hour intervals instead of 30 minute intervals.
Bryan N,"Hamilton Square, New Jersey",5,07/17/2015,Best way to see the city,"Seriously, $7 for 24 hours! Yes, you only have 30 minute intervals to use the bike (you have to dock and then request a new code), but there are hundreds of locations throughout the city. Must download the app too. It tells you every location and how many bike are available at each place.We always got where we were going in less than 20 minutes anyway and never ran into any issues of not having enough bikes or not have a rack available to park and it was a very busy weekend in the city with lots of festivals and conferences going on. The only downside is if you wanted to go on a long bike ride say along Lake Shore Drive that may not be possible. Can't say because I didn't really look into."
Plap123,"Portage la Prairie, Canada",3,07/15/2015,Station Frustration,Great concept that we were excited to find since my wife was pregnant and not wanting to walk excessively. This allowed us to take in a whole lot more of the Lake front/downtown area with a nice leisurely bike ride. However there was a trail of frustrations that hopefully can be ironed out for future riders.1) The station we had planned to use first had no bikes...Adler Planetarium - probably because not a big dropoff spot but a frustration none-the-less. We walked to Shedd.2) I checked in at the Shedd station before going in so that the process would be quicker after and rented 2 bikes. After our visit at the museum The Shedd station credit card reader wasn't working. Several people were around trying to get bikes and some were phoning but the only suggestion was to go to the Field Museum station (approx 10 minute walk). We had already paid for the day rental so we went there to see.3) The Field museum station was fully stocked with bikes however the people around the station indicated that this station wasn't reading credit cards either. Someone phoned and it was suggested that we walk to Michigan avenue another 10-15 minute walk. Would have been nice if the operator wouldn't send us to a faulty station. They must have known because someone told us it was down all day.4) Michigan station - we finally got a bike and got to ride down Michigan. Stations were well spaced here and we had no problems docking and checking in. 5) We walked through Taste of Chicago to another station but they only had 1 bike. My wide rode the bike and I jogged to Navy Pier. We got another bike.6) We rode along the lake to 360 Chicago and then headed back to Adler. When we checked in at another station it took our bikes but wouldn't read our cards. We walked 10 minutes to another station and it had no bikes. We walked to another station on Michigan and finally found bikes. The bikes took us a long ways but failed at getting us back. So much for my wife not walking much. If you use this system be prepared for unreliable stations and unpredictable availability.
Keffco,"Nipomo, California",5,07/13/2015,BEAUTIFUL WAY TO EXPERIENCE LAKEFRONT ,"Visitors only need a credit card. Read instructions online or if you are lucky as we were and found a locale with an attendant on a Sunday afternoon who walked us thru it. Press screen to activate, press language, press buy a new card, in our case allowed us to purchase two cards $14 for 24 hours use. Machine gives you codes on screen but also prints ticket with time out. Important. Go to any bike, type in code, green light flashes and bike is released. Hint, lift back seat, easier to remove. Ride away. BE MINDFUL OF TIME. Within 30 minutes simply stop by another station, repeat process but do not pay again, select ISSUE NEW CODE. Take back your same bike if you like.We chose continuous riding but easy to use for transport. Visit something and hop another bike. Hotels can print out station maps. Good exercise and great vistas."
JFLeB325,"Moncton, Canada",3,07/13/2015,Nice ride however frustrating process,"My girlfriend and I went to Chicago last month and wanted to rent these bikes. Having to swipe our credit cards over 50 times, it finally worked. Nice bike ride on the harbour front however made it really fun!"
Portland21,"Portland, Oregon",4,07/12/2015,Bikes in Chicago,"Divvy bikes were fun to use in Chicago along the lakefront trails. Once you figure out how to use, it's better, but a little confusing. It's challenging that you need to check in every 30 minutes or get extra charges. The overall 24 hour fee is very reasonable, but it would be easy to rack up more charges. If you could rent the bikes at a little higher fee and get say 2 hours, that would be more convenient."
Csilla C,"Boston, Massachusetts",1,07/06/2015,Nothing but frustration here !, I wish I had something good to say about the bike rentals in Chicago but unfortunately I have nothing redeeming to say about the service . You only can rent the bikes for 30 minutes so you spend most of your time finding the next place to park your bike. Then after that I need to re-sign in to get a new bike . We struggled and we watched many many grown functional intelligent adults not to able to sign up for a new bike try or get a bike that's already been used. It is such a poor system from start to finish and the bikes don't work that well . When you do final fine one that works well it's great ride around the city but man it's such a painful.concept. They said we should charge more allowed to renters have the bike longer than 30 minutes they could make more money and to be a less stress on the rentals.
ginar2014,"Loveland, Ohio",2,07/03/2015,"Nice option, hard to figure out ","It took us 20 min to buy our bikes. Our form was rejected twice. On the third time we didn't get codes and had to call. When we finally got codes, I got a deep bruise pulling the bike out. However, the app is nice and the many locations convenient. We enjoyed biking the lakefront trail"
LoriAnne84,"Cocoa Beach, Florida",3,06/30/2015,Fun and easy way to get around town!,"I was in Chicago on business. After our meetings my coworker and I rented some Divvy bikes to explore the Lakeside Trail and downtown. Only drawback is you have to return them within 30minutes to avoid overage fee. Also, the second time we got bikes the machine wouldn't read my credit card, so I ended up having to purchase 2 passes. I was able to call the company and they promptly refunded me. Even with the hassle of the credit card, it was still a fun way to get around town. We even rode bikes back to the hotel from dinner instead of taking a cab!"
kbb279,"Columbus, Ohio",1,06/29/2015,Make sure you bring multiple cards if you're a family!!,"Would have loved to use the Divvy Bikes but couldn't. 1) We are from the US but have Chase's upgraded ""chip and pin"" credit cards. Divvy wouldn't accept them. 2) We had a Meijer Mastercard on us but Divvy only allows 2 bikes to be reserved under 1 card. (It also didn't accept our Discover) 3) We called Divvy to see if we could charge our third rider over the phone but we couldn't. Therefore we walked and took taxis instead :("
233kimt,"Windsor, Canada",4,06/25/2015,The bike ride along the waterfront is very enjoyable.,The bikes are used for 30 minutes at a time without additional charges. You have to get to your next stop in that timeline. Does stop you from maybe enjoying the riverfront as the south end does not have many stops so you are pressed fro time to get the bike to the next stop without incurring fees.
JoeyBinChicago,"Chicago, IL",5,06/23/2015,Outstanding way to get around,"Divvy is a great way to get around, especially during the two weeks we have good weather here in Chicago. In case you can't take five minutes to read the details of your rental, here you go:1. It's $7 for 24 hours, in 30 minute increments, meaning you have to re-dock your bike every half hour or incur charges. People think this is a rip-off, but this is a bike SHARING system. If you could take the one bike for 24 hours, no bikes would be available. 2. Each station has a map showing where the other stations are. Most stations downtown are within a 2 minute bike ride, maybe a bit more in the neighborhoods. In any case, you shouldn't have a problem finding a station within 30 minutes, unless you're trying really hard not to find one. There's a Divvy app you can download that shows you where the stations are, and how empty/full they are. 3. Check your bike for flats first, and adjust the seat!4. Finally, you can save a ton by not paying for parking at the most popular attractions in the city."
alwayswander,"Brisbane, Australia",1,06/22/2015,Useless,"Don't accept non-US credit card which you only find out after failing at two stations, causing huge upset to travel plans and then googling for the answer. This ludicrous failing is not even advertised or the information given as to why credit card rejected. Sort it out Chicago."
518katier,"Columbia, South Carolina",4,06/16/2015,What a great idea!,"These bike stands are all over the city. You get unlimited rentals for 24 for only $7. A good way to see the city, as many roads are bike friendly and the entirety of the lakeshore is a bike/walking path."
visitor h,Germany,1,06/15/2015,Not working for european tourists,At the last weekend i tried to rent a bike at the Divvy station. But the kiosk doesn't accept my credit carts (VISA and Mastercard).I walked to a other station and tried it again. Same problem.Then i called the hotline. The adviser told me to by an american prepaid credit card because european credit cards are not accepted. No sooner said than done. I looked for a shop to buy such card. After 24 hours (activation time of the card). Next try. But again not possible to rent a bike.Therefore i can't recommend this service.It's better to walk or buy your own bike.
Donna E,"Owen Sound, Canada",3,06/09/2015,Great idea but needs work,"So start with the positives - this is a great idea and a great way for tourists to tour/get around the waterfront area in Chicago (which is beautiful btw). However, that said, it does not work well on a busy beautiful Saturday/Sunday afternoon when everybody wants to ride a bike! So here is our experience -We easily picked up 4 bikes at a downtown location near South Michigan Avenue. The 30 minute check in time flew by and we went to check in our bikes at a location on the waterfront. It appears that location's machine was not working well - there was a guy there trying to fix it - the racks were full of bikes and there were dozens of people standing around wanting a bike but it appeared nobody could get one! Our precious 30 minute time slot was quickly running out and finally at the last minute a few spaces opened up and we were able to quickly put our bikes on the rack so we didn't get charged the extra money. But then the lineup for the machine to re-check out another bike was a mile long! So we decided we would walk to the next location (how far could it be right?) When we got there, there was 1 lonely bike in the rack but no line up at the machine! So now there were people coming back with their rentals, racking them up and then checking them back out immediately (which is what we would have done at the last location except we couldn't get near the machine!) So again we walked to the next location - right at Navy Pier - it was a zoo with lots of bikes and lots of people - so this time we stood in line and waited to get our ticket to recheck out our bikes. We finally got our new codes and went to check out our bikes - 3 out of the 4 codes worked so 3 of us had our bikes - the 4th code would not work so 3 of us are standing there wasting minutes of our precious 30 minute time period waiting for the 4th person to get the attention of an attendant who happened to be there and get his bike out! We used up that 30 minutes, racked the bikes up for the last time and swore we would not do that again!So how could this be better? First of all - they need a much better system for rechecking out the bikes every 30 minutes. You should not have to rack your bike and then get in line to get a new ticket. And 30 minutes is really no time at all on a bike - could the rechecking period not be made at least 60 minutes? So - try it if you want - but beware those nice sunny days especially on the weekend!"
Lindsey P,,2,06/07/2015,Great idea...needs work,"My husband and I are not rubes so we knew how to handle a bike in a large, busy city but this system needs some work. 1. Look your bike over if you can, some are in really rough shape and you'll regret it once you start pedaling. 2. A lot of the stations are either full or empty no in-between3. The system of getting tickets with new codes for getting bikes is inefficient and fills your pocket with garbage4. Do locals even use these? I am not convinced. You guys need to put more stations along the Lakefront Trail. This is where everyone wants to bike. Do you want confused tourists getting honked at in Chicago traffic...NOPE. 5. The on street bike infrastructure does not match the number of stations. You need more lanes and cycle tracks because Chicago drivers are insane and scary and the tourists get scared and ride on the sidewalks like idiots. "
Peter E,,1,06/06/2015,"Great fun, but excess charges makes this expensive & confusing.",Used Bike share for a ride in Chicago - great way to get around and see the sights. Rented for 2.5 hours but got hit with a $30 excess use fee. It seems the bike needs to be checked in every 30 minutes and checked out again for continuing use.The signage did not make it clear at all about these conditions of use.Total cost for 2 bikes on our ride was $44 making it much more expensive than expected.
Bob S,Colorado,4,05/31/2015,Great outings,"We loved using Divvy bikes. The lakefront area and Lincoln Park lend themselves to biking very well. At $7 for a day, they are a bargain even though you need to turn them in every 30 minutes. Most of the places that we wanted to visit were within 30 minutes of each other. These are bulky, three-speed cruiser bikes, not meant for exercise riding..For exercise or distance riding there are regular bike rentals available along the water front.Suggest downloading the Divvy bike app before you go as it will help you find the next bike station. There are penalties for not returning the bike every 30 minutes so you need to keep track of time and location of bike stations. If you want to use a bike all day, it is more convenient to rent a regular bike. A regular bike will also get you a helmet, something that does not come with Divvys."
Hassaan H,"Nashville, Tennessee",5,05/30/2015,Excellent idea,"Thank you so much for making my trip to Chicago so much easier, fun and healthy. It is a great concept that you guys have come up with, I made great use of it.Chicago trip would not have been so enjoyable and convenient without your bicycles."
dldclub,Maryland,5,05/22/2015,SO MUCH FUN!,"What a fabulous way to travel and sightsee. Such a simple system to use, and great way to get about. I was never intimated riding in the city, great exercise, stop and go when we wanted, and always a convenient place to dump the bike and pick up a new one. Way to go Chicago for adding this to your city!"
EAEL64,"Campinas, SP",4,05/11/2015,Good way to know Chicago ,"The Divvy bike system allows you to move around Chicago cheaply and with a good chance to see more of the city than you would using taxis, buses or other means of transportation. The system works although sometimes you have to wait and try several times to get the bikes, but in general the rides are in ok shape and work properly. Good system. "
765maryjanet,"Raleigh, North Carolina",5,05/09/2015,Great Sunday Morning Ride,"We headed out on the affordable and convenient Divvy bike system on a sunny, Sunday morning. We rode down the lake shore to Navy Pier and the on to Millienium Park. It's a great way to get around the city-just be sure to turn them in every 30 minutes. The lake path around Navy Pier was under construction."
jeroend540,"Hoeven, The Netherlands",4,05/06/2015,Great way to see the city,As a dutch guy used to cycling this is a perfect way to see the city from a different view. Did the lakefront trail from McCormick conference center to the hotel. Using the bike was easy and convenient. If you use the streets in the downtown area you should be used to the traffic otherwise it can be a bit scary.
CritiquerCA,"San Diego, CA",4,04/28/2015,"Great way to see the city, spend the day","This is a fantastic way to get around. There are plenty of stations throughout the city, so you can easily get your bike checked back in within 30 minutes. Many of the streets have bike lanes, so it was just fine riding around. In some of the more popular areas (for example, around Lakeshore Dr.), sometimes the stations can be filled up or have nonworking stalls, which can be a bit of a pain. However, most are fine and the bikes are in fairly good condition. This allows you to cover WAY more ground than walking, and you can get to all the attractions without the hassle of parking or dealing with cab fare/public transit. Highly recommend this!"
aleeesha23,"Hamilton, Canada",5,04/05/2015,Great way to see the city! ,"We rented the hikes for a 24 hour period and literally saw the entire Lakeshore + activities! It was a much cheaper alternative to any other form of transportation in the city. It was beautiful to bike along the lakeshore and see the skyline. One minor issue when there wasn't enough to bikes to take out, but just went to the next docking station and grabbed one there. Easy to plan timing and return/take out. Wish we had something like this in our city! "
wanderingkale,"Valdosta, Georgia",5,12/30/2014,Great service for visitors,"I love bike share programs, and Chicago's is excellent. There are plenty of stations around all the spots visitors are likely to travel to, and the system is easy to use. Combined with the smartphone app, it is easy to plan out a route and check stations to make sure they have bikes or spots to return them. While you only have 30 minutes per trip before there are extra charges, it was very easy for us to plan our routes so that we would stop at a station, return the bikes, then check them back out to get a fresh 30 minutes. Combined with the bike trails along the lake, it was easy to get around and see everything we wanted."
Maggie_Oakshot,"Northampton, Massachusetts",5,12/20/2014,"Well restocked so that they are almost, always in the rack","My bedroom overlooks a Divvy Bike stand in the South Loop. So brushing my teeth, I see the employees in fair or foul weather restocking the rack of bikes. Before Bears games, or after. For over a year, these hard working people always rebalance the bikes so they are available. Since I haven't used one, cannot speak to that. But they do try (they come usually three times a day that I see) to keep the bikes available in the stand...but also, space for ones to be dropped off."
JMann30,"Hamden, Connecticut",4,10/22/2014,What a great vibe,The Divvy Bikes made it so easy to explore Chicago.  Some of the streets were so bike friendly with dedicated bike lanes.  The phone app to locate bike stops was so easy.  Thanks.
jh862014,"Chicago, Illinois",1,10/06/2014,Divvy doesn't accept non-US credit cards,"The idea is fantastic, but obviously it's only for those who have a US credit card! We did manage to buy our 24 hr ticket, did manage to get our bikes, but once we docked (quite some kilometers from our hotel) the party was over. We called customer service, who advised us to try the next kiosk. Which didn't work. We called again, were advised to buy another pass. Which we tried: it was not about the money, we just wanted to bike! We tried 5 different credit cards at 5 different kiosks, called customer service serveral times. What do we do wrong??? We finally got the answer. 'You don't have a US credit card!' If we only would have known that these services are only for those who posess a US credit card. In order to do others a favor, we asked Divvy to add this information to their website, kiosks etc."
DAD11,Toronto,3,10/01/2014,"Good option over bus or taxi, but not for touring","Have rented bikes in Chicago before, but when saw the Divvy rack outside our hotel and the $7 for 24 hour price thought it would be the best option. Didn't realize that you can only ride for 30 minutes at a time, then must check in at a rack before taking another ride. So if you want to go on a long ride along the terrific Chicago lake shore than rent from a bike rental company. If you want to enjoy the city by bike as you go from Art Institute to Millenium Park to Navy Pier to restaurant, etc than Divvy is an option as is CTA. "
Liz P,"Keene, New Hampshire",4,09/28/2014,Pleasant and fun bike ride,"We tried these out one day on a visit to Chicago and used the bikes for a ride along the lake side bike trail that runs along the shore of Lake Michigan We rode from the Edgewater area, south to the Oak Street Beach downtown docking our bikes about 3 times to make the trip since we stopped to do a little site seeing along the way. You can rent the bikes for 7.00 a day, the down side being that you have to park them at a docking station every half hour or incur additional fees. The stations are all over the place and as long as you time your ride , you really can do it for just the 7.00 for the day. I would suggest printing off a map of the docking stations before you ride. The bikes are simple 3 speed bikes designed mostly for sightseeing and commuters and are built like tanks. Too big for kids and they do take a little while to get used too. The ride along the lake is beautiful however."
barndoors,Ny,3,09/23/2014,Loved the Ride; Hated the glitches in the System,"We were excited to rent these bikes to ride along the Lake Michigan Waterfront. At $7 for 24 hour hours this is quite a bargain!. The downside is the technology and the requirement to return the bike to a kiosk and ""re-rent"" every half hour. We kept the bikes for two hours and loved our ride along the lake-- near Oak Street Beach and North. However, we had problems returning the bikes and getting a ""green light"" to show we had. In two hours, we had to call divvy bikes for help twice. A helpful hint is to download an app about biking chicago. This app will show you where nearby Divvy stations are located, how far away they are, how many bikes are available at a particular station and will also let you set an alarm to let you know how much time you have before you need to return the bikes to a kiosk. A great way to see the sights and get some exercise. Remember--helmets do not come with these bikes. "
RLT-Traveller,London,1,09/21/2014,Don't bother unless you have a US credit card.,"I really wanted to hire a bike and ride around the city and enjoy the beautiful Sunday weather. Unfortunately, none of my UK or Australian credit or debit cards were accepted. I expect this is because of the chip and PIN functionality that most cards (outside the US) now have. I tried it with a swipe-only pre-paid card I had from Aus, that was accepted by the 'dip' machine, but the transaction still failed, likely because I couldn't put in a US postcode.Would have been fun, shame it wasn't designed with travellers in mind!I called their help desk, they confirmed it wasn't a fault with the station, they said 'yes overseas cards work' but they didn't realise that most overseas cards now have chip and PIN. If you have an old swipe-only card maybe it would work.Very disappointing!Also strange how it said $7 on the sign, but when you start with the machine transaction it straight away becomes $14."
Millie R,"Fremantle, Western Australia, Australia",4,09/20/2014,Convenient and fun,A bit expensive at $7 an hr with a hefty fine for using it over half an hr but very convenient with spots all over the city. It was a bit hard to get the lock sorted but once we were off and rolling very convenient 
phloxMaryland,,4,09/18/2014,A beautiful hour along the lakeshore path,"I approached my Chicago biking experience with a plan - bike as far as I could along the lakefront without over doing it. I rented a bike a few blocks West of the lake and biked in the bike lane on Illinois avenue until the lane ended and I had to become one with the traffic - a tad daunting for a tourist, but I managed. It also took me awhile to locate the lake front bike path from Navy Pier, but once found, I had a great ride to Lincoln Park and back in just over an hour. I have no idea what the charge for this might have been, but it was worth it. A beautiful day and a beautiful fellow tourist to help me re-dock the bike at the end of the ride. I overshot the curb cut at one point by a few feet due to pedestrian traffic and my idea to lift the bike over a curb was met with a surprise - these bikes weigh a ton! Lifting it even six inches was a mighty feat. Also, some of the ""flipping"" around I do on my bike at home to change directions from a resting point is not going to happen with these heavy 3-speed jobs. Not sure I would trust the availability, reliability and/or speed of these bikes to deliver me from Spot A to Spot B, but a loose, casual goal for one was a beautiful way to spend an hour with the rest of humanity on a lakeside Saturday and I am grateful these bikes were available for that purpose. It would have taken me 3 hours to walk the same distance/see those same sights, so that is a deal almost any way you slice it."
Joe K,,3,09/17/2014,Nice if they all worked,"7 dollars for 24 hrs with 30 min is deff a great deal. I would recommend using the app with GPS to plan your routes as well as identifying back up stations.Some things I ran into in my one day rental.Not all stations are functioningStation which simply wouldn't take my CC to to get a new code (the station was full of bikes so that should of been a hint)Calling the operator to ask if they can generate a new code with my CC was also not an option so I had to walk 4 blocks to find another station. Station had broken bike returns , the bikes simply wouldn't lock when trying to return , so I had to find another station to return then walk back 6 blocks. On the bright side I was able to explore the city and ride down lake shore all for 7 bucks.  "
ilive4sun,"Cleveland, Ohio",2,09/16/2014,"Nice idea, but not for us as tourists","What confusion! Thank goodness there's someone who works for the company at each kiosk we went to, because it was confusing to sign up the first time, it was really confusing to figure out where the next kiosk was located (we did the app, but the map didn't say, for instance, that you had to go under a bridge and over to get to the kiosk...it just showed a dot on a map. 30 minutes is WAY too short a time period to get to the next kiosk!! Plus, do out-of-towners a favor and put some markings on the pavement or put up signs leading to your kiosks! Other people on Divvy bikes were asking US where to find the next stop, and we were no help.Also, we are tall, and the bike was uncomfortable for my 6'4"" husband. You can raise the seat, but not the handlebars, so his neck hurt after about 40 minutes. As other reviews have mentioned, it would be easier to just rent a bike for how ever many hours you wanted and ride up and down the lakeshore. That part was awesome...can't wait to do it again. Just not on a Divvy bike."
SavvyTrvl,"Chicago, IL",5,09/16/2014,Divvy Bikes: An Affordable and a Convenient Way to See the City!,"For travelers and locals alike, Divvy bikes are a great alternative to urban transportation. The bikes are very good, reliable and user friendly for non-bikers. I have been using Divvy bikes as a quick way to get around the city for two months now and have felt very safe and comfortable riding through downtown Chicago. Because the bike stands are a place to park it is a very easy way to travel short distances using bike lanes or along Lake Shore Drive!"
noxiousburrito,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",3,09/15/2014,Dangerous Fun on Chicago's Streets,"My husband and I are avid city bikers, we live in a college town and bike everywhere. We never biked in Chicago, but were excited for the challenge and decided to rent the Divvy Bikes on a recent excursion. We used them for multiple purposes on our trip everything from leisure to actual transportation between places. Overall I enjoyed the ability to be able to bike, and not rely solely on cabs, and trains for getting around. Pro: Relatively cheap, $7 for a 24 hour passPro: Biking is FunPro: Take advantage of the bike paths along the lake shorePro: Cool basket like space on front of bike for carrying itemsPro: Big tires, allows ability to go on and off of curbs with easeCon: Once you get too far West Divvy check in points are sparseCon: Having to check in every 30 minutesCon: Check in & check out doesn't always go smoothlyCon: Brakes are crapCon: Downtown, Mag Mile - You better be ready to ride in the streetCon: Cab drivers & bus drivers tailgate you, and don't careCon: Super heavy, too heavy to carry up stairs for instance"
Greg K,"Wixom, Michigan",2,09/02/2014,Labor Day in Chicago,"What a great idea but some execution issues. Trouble with getting bikes out and with 6 people, once the last bike was out, the first person had to restart to keep the 30 minute window moving. Maybe a 1 hour window would be smarter. So many miles of trails and the views along Lake Michigan made the ride a great experience. If we were to do this again we would probably look to rent bikes for the day or a set time and not worry about the every 30 minute restart. Overall a good idea but needs to be better executed."
Gredgeman,"Springfield, Missouri",4,08/23/2014,Nice way to see the Lakeside attractions,"I really like the convenience of this. 30 minutes per use, I wish I could
have opted for 1 hour at a time. Overall I went everywhere I wanted to go with time to spare, once I downloaded the app it was even easier."
savvytraveller2014,"Dorset, United Kingdom",2,08/15/2014,good in theory,Loved the idea and the cost but when we went to hire the bikes one stand was empty and then found that we could only hire two bikes with each card. However when we tried our amex card it did not work. Not sure if this is just because we are from the UK. Met others who had not understood the need to return the bikes to a stand in 30 mins and feel sure that they will end up with a big bill.
MS03t1,"Cedar Rapids, Iowa",4,08/13/2014,Fun Fun Fun,"This the second time we have rented the Divvy Bikes. Always fun to ride along Lake Michigan and around Michigan Ave. Price is right as long as you watch your time and checks bikes back in when due. Only complaint is that you can only check out two bikes at a time and you can only use a credit card once. That is difficult when you have more than 4 in your family. Plus the machine is sensitive at reading the cards and sometimes lines are long so that just holds things up. With all that being said it is still worth it. I would recommend biking on a Sunday morning when there are no crowds, sail boats are out on the lake and it is serene. "
Errbear,"Golden, Colorado",4,08/13/2014,Very good when it is working,"This is a cool idea for getting around the downtown area and other areas close by. We rode around a lot over 6 days for relatively cheap. The idea is that you can rent a bike for 24 hours for $14. You pay the one time fee with a credit card and it gives you a code to enter on the bike dock. This unlocks the bike and off you go. The pros - cheap, many locations all over, an app that is supposedly great for locating bike stations (we were having personal app issues). Cons - you have to ""return"" your bike every 30 mins in order to avoid overage charges (you can do this as many times as you want within your 24 hour rental period), you then ""re-rent"" your bike and get a new code to unlock the bike (you must insert your original credit card so that they know you are the right person). You have to find a docking station where you are before the end of your 30 minutes - there are a lot but not always right in front of you when you need them and having to look at the website on your phone is not necessarily convenient, not all the docking spots work - sometimes you get a new code to rent the bike and it won't unlock (you have to make sure beforehand that the light on the dock is yellow). Sometimes it won't even let you return the bike because the docking space is not working. Then you have to either find another location and/or call the number listed on the machine. Sometimes the credit card reader is not working so you have to find another location - this happened several times for us and it was very frustrating. We called the number listed and they apologized and said they were having issues and added more time on our account for the trouble. All in al, I liked this idea and if everything had been working we would have rated it an excellent. Since there were issues I gave it only a Very Good. "
Hayley P,"Elkhart, Indiana, United States",2,08/12/2014,Had to walk,"We have risen the bikes before on our last trip to Chicago and it worked well the one day we used them so we used them again but after docking to get a new code, it wouldn't accept our card or the people behind us in line. So we called to see if they could give us a code because we had paid for it and the lady said they weren't able to give us a free code but my husband explained we have already purchased it, it's not free? She said there's nothing I can do you will have to walk to a different rental....frustrated as we have paid and can't use it, walked to the next one and there weren't bikes, finally we found one. Obviously frustrated that we paid to ride and she couldn't give us a code and instead were told to walk until we found one which defeats the purpose."
Sean W,"Traverse City, Michigan",1,08/04/2014,Awful,"My family and I wanted to rent bikes to rife around Millennium and Grant Parks. The first station we tried none of our credit or debit cards would take and it was the same for every body else to. The next station we tried it was the same and people couldn't return their bikes so most of them had to pay an extra $7.00 for another half-hour of riding they spent trying to contact the company. I don't suggest renting bikes from Divvy and would never do it again, very disappointing."
rnewsome75,"Memphis, Tennessee",2,07/29/2014,I Love to Hate It...,"The Chicago Divvy bike system is a fantastic idea--in theory. You buy a 24 hour pass for $7. You get a code from the kiosk, enter the code into the bike rack, then remove your bike--in theory. Then, you can ride for 30 minutes before returning it to a station, where you return it to the rack, dip your credit card into the kiosk for a new code, then remove your new bike from the rack--in theory. Unfortunately, the kiosks are bogged down, the bike racks don't always lock and recognize a return, the lines for the kiosks are long and more often than not, the racks are either all full or empty, so you have to go to another station. We spent an entire day using Divvy and called customer service 5 times to fix code issues or to issue new codes because the bike racks didn't recognize our return. I LOVE the idea, but won't use it again until they get some kinks worked out."
Mommyof4greatkids,"Ooltewah, Tennessee",3,07/29/2014,"Ok, BUT","The bikes were good, loved riding them, but be aware....we had to go to 4 stations to finally rent one and the directions it hives you yo get to close by stations are not clear to someone unfamiliar to the area. The fact that to avoid extra cost you have to return the bike every 30 min. Isn't great for the visitor who isn't familiar with the area either. We were afraid to go too far away from the stalls for fear of not being able to find a place to exchange bikes. We lived riding along the lake, but next time I would rent from elsewhere."
Carlos B,"Austin, Texas",3,07/23/2014,Really frustrating machines!!,"I was in Chicago for a long weekend, the concept is extremely good. The system worked good for the first day but the second day it seemed as if we had been ""black listed"" for using them too much the day before hahaha... Using the same credit card and same stations to get bikes, and none worked to get us on the bikes. It is definitely the way to get around in the city but if it does not work, its really frustrating!! I would recommended with the clear understanding that the readers seem to be the issue, and because I am a cyclist. I love it when I see tons of people using bikes as a mode of transportation. If I am in Chicago or a city with similar kind of bikes I will choose them over cars but hopefully this companies listen to us (customers) and try to fix these issues."
BeccaMoreno,"Dallas, Texas",4,07/22/2014,Divvy made it easy to get around town without a car,"My husband and I used the Divvy rental bikes to get around town on a couple of occasions. Someone told us that Divvy is fairly new to Chicago, so not all the stations seemed ready. For example, our Google Maps mobile app said there was a station in a particular location, but someone told us that this location was still under construction. Something nice is that there is a map of nearby locations at each station, including a circle showing how far a 5-minute walk would be.The bikes are really heavy (probably because of the technology needed for the rental), so it made it a little difficult to ride and make tight turns. Overall, we had a blast using the bikes. We rode up the Lakefront Path, which is a must-do when visiting Chicago. We used the bikes to go to Rib Fest and do some sight seeing. Divvy made an already walkable city (no hills!) even easier to navigate!"
nancy K,"Chicago, Illinois",2,07/21/2014,Better Customer Satisfaction Desperately NEEDED,"Apparently we have been using the DIVVY Bikes (Blue Bikes) all around the downtown Chicago area to get around. There is a convenience and pleasure to having access to these bikes in a lot of locations. There is also a lot of room for improvement for the bike user. During the month of July, we have encountered these problems along with others encountering the same problems. First you get only 30 minutes from point A to point B, to find another DIVVY bike stand. This does not give you enough time to unload your bike, especially if you are new to the DIVVY and have to locate a drop off. 30 minutes about time you are on your bike and headed out you will lose at least 5 mins. If you are with a few people, they too have to check out and if there is a line of people, which we have encountered at various locations, your time is ticking aways. Then when you get to another location and there is a line you have to wait to checkout another bike. The screens you have to go through are numerous and confusing especially to tourists and foreigners, they don't have a zip code or a easy phone number, along with reading all the acceptances you have to accept from 1 screen to another and there have been a few occasions credit cards work at one location and don't at the next, along with have to pay more than $7 if you go over the 30 minute check in, which adds up quickly. We got to the point where we avoided checking in because to check out again and wait in the line of people who don't understand the lengthy checkout process, gets frustrating. Also, after a month of these encounters, we walked to 2 locations in 1 day to find no bikes in the racks to be checked out. Talk about being stranded in a city! Too expensive, not enough time to ride should be 1 hour from point A to B, stock the bikes and make the screen more customer friendly for everyone to use!"
Carleton_Alumna,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",4,07/20/2014,Excellent way to see the city,"The way it works... Go to a station, and $7 gives you a ""day pass."" However note that in order to make sure that people return bikes, and there's always a supply, they limit you to 30 minutes in any one stint before they start adding extra usage fees. You can trade in and out as much you want for the day, as long as each trade is 30 minutes or less. Our observation is that there were always enough bikes, but because the check-out process at the station is a little long, you can end up spending too much time in line waiting for people to get checked out. I think I would just incur the usage fees in the future to avoid the lines (the usage fees start small and then escalate at over an hour). They have an app where you can see the tons of different Divvy stations.We were there on a busy, gorgeous Saturday and rented our first bike at Millenium Park and traveled to Navy Pier and then up the lake shore up to Briar Theater to see Blue Man Group for a total of around 5 miles with one trade in the middle. Note that if it's a weekend, and you think it will be gorgeous to go to the lake shore, so will everyone else. Factor a fun, but pretty slow ride into your calculations. Also make sure you're pretty comfortable riding a bike in general - there are lots of pedestrians and bikers to navigate, and presumably you won't be wearing a helmet. Overall, we had a blast and would definitely recommend this as a way to navigate the city."
Jrmmb,,1,07/18/2014,Deceptive advertising,"We rented 4 bikes in the along lake Shore Drive"" while we all read the directions it was not clear you could only ride 30 minutes. the pass said for all day, it was a 24 hour pass after all. Riding from Millenium to North beach then back to the planetarium with a lunch stop costs us $180. For the use of four bikes. Needless to say I could have bought a bike for what the rentals cost. What a rip off to our guests and travelers from out of town. I will never use these bikes again."
DecloGuy,,5,07/15/2014,Made my Trip!,"I was in Chicago for a total of 18 hours, when I had two hours to kill between meetings I rented a Divvy Bike and was very glad that I did. I was able to see a lot of Chicago in a very short time. Chicago is also a bike friendly city."
handydixon,"Castle Rock, Colorado",5,07/14/2014,Love!,"Saved SO much $$! Got in some exercise, had a blast. Downloaded the app to my phone for a general idea of where I was. Loved that I could park, shop/sightsee & then pick up another bike. Great idea!"
Shea_Chicago,"Chicago, Illinois",4,07/11/2014,Great concept but broken machines,"I love and hate the divvy bikes. There were stations near almost everything that I wanted to go to and it was much more fun than walking or driving. I would never take this if I had a set time that I wanted to be somewhere, but it was ok for the weekend, which is what I was using it for. However, the stations almost never worked. Spanish seemed to work more often than us than English. The process of renting needs to be made faster, and they should put more than one machine at the more popular stops. Once they work out the issues, I will use the bikes all the time."
Rick G,"San Antonio, Texas",4,07/11/2014,Family Vacation with 2 Families,"Two families with 5 kids ranging from 10 years to 15 years of age. We had a blase riding bikes along Lakeshore Blvd for 2 days. Rode up to Lincoln Park zoo and further north and then down south to the Field Musuem and Shedds Aquarium.Would have like to have rode down to the Science and Engineering museum, but due to events in that area at that time, we were not able.I will list the Pros and Cons below;Pros - can be a low cost. Easy to ride, plenty of bikes and station to pick up and turn in bikes. Can adjust seat heights and riding along Lakeshore Blvd was very scenic and fun. After the 1st day I figures out to ride the bikes for about 30 to 60 minutes and then dock bikes. Checking out bikes was easy if card machine is working. We were able to rent the bikes for about 15 dollars a day if checking in as required. Cons - You can only ride for about 30 minutes or you will inccur overtime charges. Overtime charges are not that bad for 30-60 minutes or even up to 90 minutes, but anytime after that can be expensive. You have to dock you bikes and then you can check them out again. But if you were like us with 8 bikes, you might come up to a station that does not have 8 docking stations ( so then what do you do - you want to turn in your bike but no places to dock so you end up going to another docking station). Next you have to charge the bike on a credit card and only two bike per credit card max. If you were like me with 4 then I had to use two credit cards. At times the machine would not read one of my credit cards so I had to use my friends credit card to obtain the bike. You have to make sure when you dock your bike that you make sure the light turns green or your bike will not be docked and you could inccur high charges. If you keep the bike 24 hours without docking then the cost can be as high as $100 plus. Last day we rode up to the Shedds aquarium and was hoping to ride back once musuem closed, but when we went to the bike station, all the bikes where checked out. Would not recommend riding bikes in the city as a little to dangerous."
lesjorgie,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",4,07/10/2014,Wonderful Way to Enjoy an Afternoon,"I'm familiar with this bike model as they are popping up all over the country including my hometown of Washington DC. I rode around town with my sister, from the Magnificent Mile to Lincoln Park to go to the zoo. Chicago is incredible accessible for bikers, and it seemed that the Divvy Bikes were being used a lot. I would definitely recommend picking up a good map from a tourist location to ensure you have a map of bike lanes and paths to make it easier on you."
Mark B,"Warren, Michigan",4,07/07/2014,GREAT CONCEPT!! Needs some refining,"On a weekend trip to Chicago this summer, we discovered Divvy bikes. The regular cost is $7 for 24 hours (a HUGE bargain!) but was on sale this weekend for $5! We were excited to rent bikes for our group (7 of us) and ride around town. our first experience was a bad one, unfortunately. You can only rent two bikes per credit/debit card, which we think is really dumb and inconvenient. Some of the bikes would not ""unlock"" from the station (it is self-serv), so, in a nutshell, after over an hour, we could not rent the bikes (and had paid some $35 on various credit cards.) Apparently , the problem had been with that particular bike station (there was MANY, MANY many of these staions around town.) We tried to get bikes (under the same rentals) at a different time and station, and all worked fine. Riding around town was a fantastic experience (as are the bike lanes) and we learned so much in doing so. This is an incredible concept and bargain, but you need to work out the kinks!! Allow as many bikes per card as you want AND have a way of knowing whether the bike/station is functioning properly before you insert money and attempt rental. GOOD IDEA!!"
Carlyn S,,1,07/05/2014,Bad service and kinks need worked out. ,"4th of July worked ok. However 5th of July we only got to use the service once in the morning to bike to adler planetarium. Which would have been great but the adler station wasn't working and we had to ride our bikes a 1/2 mile to the field museum and walk back the half of mile. When we tried to use them in the afternoon, the machines were down again and we walked to 5 different stations to find a guy taking the bikes because the station was full. However we could not get any bikes and we left to walk all of millennium park and Michigan ave. The guy from Divvy said that we could call the 800# which I already did. Customer service is in Canada and was no help at all. They said a tech would be out in an hour. Whoever runs the DC bikes has it all figured out. I would not recommend for convenience."
Kim T,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5,07/02/2014,A great way around Chicago,"It used to be expensive to tour a far-away city by bike; I did so for much of a day for $7, the cost of a day pass to the system (after which all trips under 30 minutes are free...if you want to go farther just check a bike in at a station partway along your route, then check it right back out again!).This all works better in Chicago, where topography is rarely a problem, than a hillier city. [The climate runs to extremes that make choosing good weather essential...]Helmets are recommended but not required (awfully good idea, though)."
James M,Southeast WI,5,07/02/2014,Perfect Way to get around Chicago,"The divvy bike stations are an absolute must when you feel the need to visit many spots and not walk it all or drive and pay the parking...there are plenty of stations and lots of convenience to the system...even when we had an issue with using our credit card at a station, they gave us a code for a reduced rate when we did find a station."
Katherine S,,1,07/02/2014,Terrible Customer Service,"Very Disappointed, I rented two bikes from the museum campus and rode them to Navy Pier. Once I made it to that terminal, the station was down and a tech was there to fix the issue. However, I was informed by the workers I can leave the bikes with them and they will text the Supervisor the code on the bikes to let them know we were on time to avoid extra fees. Now my issue is the next day I was charged extra fees so I called customer service and explained my situation. The First rep “Your case will be escalated and someone will contact you within 24 hours. Never got a call back The Second Rep I explained my situation again. I even ask did the previous rep leave notes she stated “NO” and insured me she noted everything plus she will give me a call back the next day if no one has contacted me back. Never got a call back The Third time I call I spoke with a supervisor (which probably was not) I explained myself again, why because there were no notes and this person said he will refund the fees. I emailed customer service got the same response.  “Thank you for contacting us. Your case has been escalated and is currently being reviewed. We need more time to obtain more information about the station involved. We will be contacting you soon about the status of the refund request. Thank you”I called again spoke with another rep I explained the situation once more. At first he could not find my information, and then he said the last time I rode was in 2012 which is very funny because Divvy just had a one year anniversary. Now the first and second rep I spoke with stated they are not authorized to issue refunds, however, the last rep said he issued a refund (I don’t believe that either). Ok so no one leaves notes nor did the Supervisor issue a refund. Basically when a bike station is down no one reports the issue?Divvy Customer Service is horrible…"
JoeBlackOld,"Chicago, Illinois",4,07/01/2014,used CHI Bikes app to navigate next station,"I work in the Loop and commute via Metra. My wife and I took the BNSF Saturday morning express to the Loop, hop on a Divvy around Union Station, and do our relays to lakefront, museum campus, and Cermak Chinatown. CHI Bikes app is helpful in determining what station to go next. We will do six to ten Divvy relays before catching later afternoon BNSF express back to the western 'burb.Divvy can do a better job in providing a more detailed downtown Chicago station map. The one I found on the website only covered North Ave to Museum campus. There is only one station on the Lakeshore Drive side of Grand Park, can use couple more to be tourists friendly.There are a lot more designated bike lanes compared to five years ago, but in some places the bike lane is not in a continuous stretch. In the absence of bike lane such as a crossing a narrow bridge overpass, sometimes we opted to ride on the sidewalk rather than competing with cars and CTA buses. Overall, my wife and I enjoyed Saturday biking around Chicago lakefront. We plan do couple more bike outings in the coming months: far-north route to 4800 north / Lawrence; and far-south route to Hyde Park UC/Museum of S&I."
TR182Flyer,"San Jose, California",5,06/30/2014,Incredibly convenien,"I had never tried these bike rental kiosks before, but I decided to give it a try rather than taking cabs and the L around the city. Boy, was I surprised!The commute from the Loop down to Mc Cormick would have been $5 each way on the electric train, probably $20 for a cab and simply too far to walk (3 miles?). By bike it was an easy 10 minute trip while you rode along the banks of Lake Michigan. It was spectacular and such a great way to get some modest exercise while enjoying the glorious Spring weather.I also used Divvy to try out a great Indian restaurant across town and to later rent a car at Union Station. It was just to convenient and affordable, I just couldn't believe it. If you're tired of staring out of car windows or noisy trains, give these Divvy bikes a try. You just may change the way you get around downtown Chicago forever!"
Marsha B,,5,06/22/2014,Best way to see Chicago!,"I cannot say enough good things about this service! My husband I were visiting our daughter and we were able to bike to Pilsen, Wicker Park, Navy Pier and all along the lakefront. Yes, the 30 minute time limit is a drawback, however the docking stations are plentiful and the Divvy app is invaluable for locating the closest stations! BYOH-bring your own helmut!"
Jem714,"Chicago, Illinois",5,06/16/2014,Divvy is awesome BUT... what you need to know before you rent,"Before we get a summer full of tourists reviews about how frustrating Divvy is and how the 30 minute time limit is too short, I thought I'd be a helpful Chicagoan and give some background and tips.First, Divvy was never meant to be a service for tourists to ride up and down the lakefront all day. Divvy is essentially for what is referred to as ""the last mile"". For example, my dentist is a mile from the brown line stop so I can walk 20 minutes or I can jump on Divvy. Many Chicagoans also commute on them (if their office is a ways from Union Station for example). Personally, I ride it the roughly 3 miles into downtown from home and back which saves me a crowded train ride and cuts my commute by 20 minutes. So there's some background.If Divvy can also provide a fun and interesting way to see the city for tourists, that is just an added benefit. When I see comments complaining about the 30 minute limit and saying that ""what people use Divvy for is to see the lakefront"" I suspect the commenter is not familiar with urban areas and does not understand the service.So how and why can you use Divvy on a trip to Chicago?1. you're in a small group (< 4). Most Divvy stations rarely have 4+ bikes available. Why? Because bikes come and go and people are jumping from one place to the other.2. you're comfortable on a bike. Divvy bikes are heavy...so that people don't steal them and because they were never meant to be used to toodle around the lakefront for hours. I run marathons and it took me a week of commuting for my quads not to burn. Also, Chicago drivers are getting better but they still tend to speed around cyclists and not look before opening doors.3. you understand the system. $7 for 24 hrs does NOT mean you get the bike for 24 hrs. Divvy doesn't want bikes out of the system for 24 hrs. Also, they don't want you locking them up (or potentially getting them stolen). Re-dock the bike and get a new one when you need it. (Yes, I understand the lines can be long and check in is a process. Because the system is aimed towards annual members who can grab a bike and go that last mile...)4. you've downloaded an app to find stations and available bikes. Divvy doesn't have an app but they do share data freely so many apps are available by developers using the data. This will allow you to plot out where you're going and ensure there are bikes and/or free docks. If you don't know what an app is, I definitely don't recommend that you Divvy =)If you're in a sizeable group and/or want to ride around the lakefront all day, parking it, picnicking, visiting the zoo, etc, rent an actual bike. I don't know the services' names but I'm certain there is at least one on Navy Pier and area bike shops likely do the same."
BostonVagabond,Boston,4,06/16/2014,Poor kiosk format,"Bikes are what they are, locations are good but the format at the kiosk is very poor for day passes. A group of us (6) would spend 10-20 minutes at each kiosk trying to get it to accept credit cards. Had to call them to get overages waived due to full or inoperable locking stations. Need to work out kinks to make more user friendly for tourists. Would rent bike with lock next time if same format at kiosk Great city though!"
Kristina G,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",3,06/11/2014,Divvy- A little frustrating,"Great idea for active people like me and my husband, but they need to work out a few kinks. During our initial rental, the transaction did not go through so we had to call the hotline to get it sorted out. Also, the 30 minute time limit is a bit stressful especially when the drop off area is full and you have to find another (which happened to us and a few other people at the Navy Pier location). I loved the app that helped find the drop off locations. It was very easy to use and helpful."
jo6688,"Storrs, Connecticut",5,06/08/2014,Great way to see a lot of the city,"Rented Divvy bikes when I was visiting friends who live in Chicago. In just a couple hours, we were able to see most of the sites in the Loop, down to Navy Pier, and around Museum Campus. I was shocked at how much I could see in such a short time. You definitely get a different view of the city riding down the streets than you would riding the L or sitting in the backseat of a cab. There are quite a few apps to help you find local stations, just make sure your phone doesn't run out of battery! It also helped that my friends, the locals, knew where docking stations were. Customer service isn't great, but if you can't dock your bike for some reason, they can extend you another 15 minutes. There are a LOT of stations around, so the next one is usually only 5 minute walk away.Most of the city is pretty flat so it was a very easy ride, especially for me and I am quite out of shape and don't do any regular exercise. This was definitely a fun experience and I'd absolutely recommend it to anyone. I hope other cities I visit have similar programs!"
BikegoddessJulie,"Chicago, Illinois",4,06/05/2014,Bike around Chicago and see so much,"I am from Chicago and a member of the Divvy program which is run the same way as the Capital Bikes program in D.C. along with some other city bike programs.Things to know:*You can buy a 24 hour or 3 day pass*This pass is good for unlimited use in that time frame however, you must re-dock your bike every 30 minutes in order to not be charged excess usage fees*You swipe a credit card to get started following the onscreen instructions*You will receive a 5 digit code which you can use to unlock any of the bikes at the station*Be aware that if a bike needs servicing, the seat may be turned around to show that it should not be selected or the red light will be lit so you cannot un-dock it*I suggest you set your seat height, numbered for future rental use, and any bags in the open sided basket before you enter the code to remove the bike*To remove the bike you may have to lift the rear of the bike to angle it out of its dock*Get on, make sure the bike work, watch for traffic and roll*Re-dock your bike, go back to the kiosk and re-swipe your credit card to get a new release code to take a bike back out. The wait time to re-dock and get a new bike is about 30 seconds I believe. Use the same credit cardI highly recommend you download the free app CycleFinder which will show you the location of other docks and offers a timer. There are 3000 Divvy's and about 300 stations mostly in the Loop, Near north, north and near west sides of the city. There are some south in Pilsen and Hyde Park as well. It’s a great way to roll around Chicago, however you need to be certain you stay on streets and not end up on Lake Shore Drive. Rules of the road apply and you should not ride on Michigan Ave. as well as a safety precaution. Be smart, there are plenty of bike lanes and easier streets to ride to get to where you need to go. Do not leave your bike unattended as you are responsible for it. Be courteous when you ride and do not run over pedestrians, they have the right of way over cyclists. Have fun and be safe!If you are a cyclist and interested in riding with others, please check out ChicagoCyclingClub.Org for scheduled free rides in and around Chicago"
indythad,"Indianapolis, Indiana",3,06/04/2014,"She's a beast, I call her Divvy","Cool concept. Gave it a whirl with mixed results. 24 hour pass, but you only get the bikes for 30 minute segments. If you want to joyride, find a real rental place. If you want to get around town and not hoof it, this will do the trick. 30 minutes isn't a lot of time to gain a real long distance unless you are on Lakeshore trail. A bike map of Chicago would have been helpful. Dearborn goes one way north with a dedicated SAFE bike lane. I would guess there is a south bound as well. The bike is a BEAST. Heavy and not great for weaving in and out of large crowds. Found it much more enjoyable early in the AM with no one around. These stations are all around, and some are staffed with employees to help. Some of the bikes I had trouble adjusting the seat. They are rentals, and as Seinfeld said, ""give me the insurance because I am going to beat the h#ll out of this"". I liked it, wife did not if that helps."
Choolwhip,"Iowa City, Iowa",4,05/29/2014,Great way to see the city!,"Instead of driving or taking a 45 minute cab ride 6 miles to Wrigleyville, we decided on the Divvy bikes. It was a beautiful day and the perfect idea! The only downside to the rental is the 30 minute time limit. If you don't dock the bike within 30 minutes and get a new code, then you get charged an extra $2.00. It can be tricky to find a Divvy bike station."
JustHavingFun11,"Sarasota, Florida",4,05/29/2014,Once you check em out it's great,"we had some difficulties checking the bikes out because of the computer, but after that it was GREAT! We used the bikes (on and off) for the whole day and we loved it. The bikes are good for adults and older teens if you stick to the bike paths. "
Ronald W,"Chicago, Illinois",5,05/28/2014,"Great Transportation option, great bargain - $7 for 24 hours (remember to return it to a station every 30 minutes.)","I am not a visitor so I was not at a busy site. There was a little bit of learning the first time I used it and it was dark adding to my confusion. Once I I got the hang of it it was great. I picked up a bike when I got off the subway at the Illinois Center, dropped the bike off a work. At lunch ran an errand to a book store - dropped the bike off 2 blocks away and then found a divvy next to the store. Rode back to the Illinois center to renew my driver's license. Rode back to work. then rode back to the El when the day was over.It looks like they are expanding the system. More bikes are at the Divvy locations near me - looks like it is doubled. One hang up was when there was someone video taping the system and I had to shoo her away so I could get a bike. I had no trouble with my credit cards but it is good to know about the 2 bike limit per card. I am planning to buy the 1 year membership for $75. Sounds like a good deal. I can use it everyday to ride from El to work.One concern - you need to bring your own helmet."
polski12,,2,05/26/2014,"Great concept, poor execution","While on a trip to downtown, having family from out of town, we rented five bikes on Lake Shore Drive. We found the $7/ day price was reasonable and bikes were solid but that is where good part of review ends. Onto the bad part. First, at busy locations there is always a line. Many are first time users, like us, so check out takes forever. With only one terminal be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes. In addition, card readers on the terminal are horrible and reject most of transactions. As credit card swipe is the last step in the check out, you go thru multiple screens entering info to get ""can't read your card"" message at the end. Many patient folks tried number of times but others walked away. Second, if you are renting multiple bikes, you need multiple cards as there is a limit of two per card. After the check out you get a code to unlock your bike, but as the check out process takes forever, you may get code on one card, but by the time you get another one on another your five minutes may be up on the first one. As the customer service on the phone couldn't help you need to get in line again to get a set of new codes....another 15-20 minutes. Third, the 30 minutes limit puts you always in rush not knowing where the stations are or if there will be space to return them causing a bit of anxiety. They will charge you $2 per bike if you don't ""check them in"" before your 30 minutes are up. Fourth, getting or returning 5 bikes can be a huge challenge as either there are not enough bikes at the station or not enough empty ports to return them. In summary, rent at your own risk. Be prepared to got thru pains but riding the bike in the city is fun."
sidder,"West Chester, Pennsylvania",5,05/24/2014,Divvys for Dummies - what you need to know!,"Confusing the first time, but so worth the ride!! What we learned:1. Bring all of your credit cards The machine is picky and would not accept some of our Visas2. You can rent 2 bikes on one credit card. If you want to rent 2 more, you MUST use another credit card3. Your code is typed on the bottom of the receipt, so you do not have to memorize it4. Type in your code and wait for the green. Pull back bike tire up first, then the whole bike5. ****When you renew. Return bike, insert your credit card and hit ""REQUEST ADDL CODE"" . You will get a new code on the receipt, enter it, and you're good to go!!!Happy cycling!"
buckscntymom,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5,05/12/2014,Great idea!,We rode for miles and miles... enjoyed the convenience of so many Divvy kiosks around the city.  Great way to experience the city!  We used a 24 hours pass... I think it was $7?
Cherry_Wonderdog,Massachusetts,4,04/27/2014,Conceptually great; pragmatically flawed,"Terrific way to see Chicago assuming you can go with the flow and deal with chaos. This new bike system deserves support, because it’s much more ecological and fun to ride bikes than to travel like snails on buses or, even worse, moles in the underground subway. Instead of identifying and catching the right public transport, we decided one day to try out the Divvy bikes and simply head in the direction of the Willis Tower. Because it was Easter Sunday, traffic was minimal, and it was great to take advantage of the weather outdoors. Once we arrived, we locked up the bikes in the nearby station, walked around, and acted like tourists. Then we decided to ride across town to get a view *of* the Willis Tower from the Hancock. So as customary, we dutifully reentered the same credit card into the dispensing machine, renewed our codes, chose two new bikes, adjusted the seats, and rode quickly through different sections, along the river, etc. It was all very pleasant.Unfortunately, the Achilles’ heel of Divvy Bikes is the system, itself. It’s new and has issues. First and foremost, it’s not always easy to find docking stations. There may be an App for this, but we didn't have it. As a result, we were always at the mercy of our eyesight, someone in the neighborhood, or our sixth sense. Don’t assume that just because you want to go to an attraction, there’s going to be a place to park right next door. And a Divvy Bike isn't something you want to park just anywhere. For one thing, you get penalized after 30 minutes. For another, you’re liable for $1,200 if it gets stolen. Second, it’s invariable that things can and will go wrong. For example, after we left the Hancock Tower, we couldn't find a docking station. When we finally did, it wouldn't accept our credit card. The system – like many others in Chicago – was plagued by software upgrade quirks, at least this is what was explained to me over the phone by one of the many Divvy folks whom I called during our two rentals. On this particular occasion, we had to walk to the next docking station which was several blocks away and, again, hard to find. After at least a mile of searching, we found one, but by that point, we felt as if we could have made it home by foot.The next day, we docked our bikes at the museum plaza near the Field Museum. It had taken nearly 30 minutes to get there. Unfortunately, to re-rent bikes, we needed to wait in a line of 10 people, some of whom were trying to rent for the first time, all of whom were having problems. The machine was being uncooperative (because of the aforementioned software update issues), and each person tried at least twice before giving up. After waiting for three of four people to fail, WE gave up and walked back to the lake on our own. Eventually, since there weren't any other docking stations, we walked all the way home.On the last day, we tried Divvy bikes again. This time, we rode from the Hotel to the Lincoln Park Zoo along Lake Michigan. It was a great bike ride and required making one bike exchange along the way. There was a Divvy representative there to greet folks and check to see if everything was going alright. At that point, everything was, but when we got to the zoo, we discovered that, contrary to what we had been told, there was place to park. So again, I called Divvy bikes and explained the situation. They granted us an extension so that we could at least spend time at the zoo, albeit with bikes in tow. Finally, on our way back, I got a flat tire, so it took even longer get both bikes back to the closest docking station (which we found out of luck). Once they were docked, I called Divvy Bikes, and they removed the charges, but we were obligated to take a snail bus home from the beginning of Michigan Avenue. The Divvy folks – all of whom were heavily accented -- provide good service and were quite helpful, but they're at the mercy of the Divvy system. Twice they decided that the “resolution” was simply to reimburse us. Frankly, though, $7 isn't much of a hardship, so a refund doesn't make a huge difference. All in all, I believe the concept of Divvy Bikes is fantastic, and I’m glad there are as many bikes as there are today. When it works, it's great. Who can beat riding bikes around the city? Unfortunately, it’s nowhere near the level of perfection required by tourists. Hopefully they can fix the software issues, add more docking stations in less conspicuous places, and maybe introduce an app that can guide you in the right direction and even allow you to renew codes from your own mobile device. Additionally, I would welcome the option of hour-long rentals instead of 30 minutes – say for $12 per day instead of $7 -- which would help happy wanderers relax instead of constantly worrying about where to park."
southamericandude,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",5,04/21/2014,Awesome way to go around Chicago,"Decided to buy a travelzoo voucher to go around Chicago without moving the car and paying for parking. Great deal $4 for 24 hr rental. You can use this for up to 30 mins each time and it is unlimited. Sounds weird cause you want to use the bike for more than 30 mins but it works perfect. The bikes are good for visiting places and dropping them at their stations which are almost every 3 blocks in downtown Chicago. So we went to Navy Pier drop the bike, come back and grab the bike and ride to magnificent mile and drop the bikes, do shopping, then grab the bikes, go to the French market, etc. You save a lot of time by moving with the bikes and it is a lot of fun. Normally the price is $7 per day.Also I don't trust Chicago drivers but they are pretty good since there is bikers all over the city. I was uneasy at the beginning but it went away after the first ride.Tip: bring your smartphone cause that helps you find all the stations where to drop and pick up the bikes and also it helps you find the spots you want to stop. Also you need a credit cardNext time I will totally do it again"
Nordie200,"Laurence Harbor, New Jersey",5,12/26/2013,Excellent way to get around the city,"This is a great way to see Chicago at your own pace and on your own itenerary. For a few dollars ($7 when I was in Chicago) you can get a day pass and all you need to do is bike from one location to the next withing 30 minutes. There are plenty of locations all over the city and there is always one close to the major sights. If the location does not have open slots to return the bike, you get another 15 minutes to return it to the next station. Get the online app for your SmartPhone to see where the locations are and how many bikes and open slots are available. Once you return your bike, you can immediately take a new one. Great way to see Chicago if you are a little bit familiar with the city."
SJKtravels,"Marrakech, Morocco",5,11/22/2013,If you don't have a bike in Chicago you can get it here.,"I own a biking company in Morocco, so I like to see what other cities have. Divvy was a great way to get around the city. You have to drop the bikes off every so often but totally worth it. They're heavy, but they should be with the weather and wear and tear I'm sure they go through. I would definitely recommend people give it a shot. I'm going to see how we can bring these to Marrakech."
432joeb,"Detroit, Michigan",5,11/05/2013,Great way to see the city,"I wanted to bike around the city while on vacation to see the neighborhoods. Rather than bring a bike I was told by a friend about DIVVY. The bike stands are very accessible. I used my credit card and away I went. I am 6 ft 3 and I was able to raise the seat so I was riding comfortably. Three gears made for easy peddling. In the center city you have to be alert, but the marked bike lanes are a big help. As a first time rider I also received a discount coupon from a Divvy attendant who happened to be at my station. I'll be taking another ride with them for sure."
SandcruiserX,"San Francisco, California",5,11/01/2013,"convenient, fun, cheap","for $7 I got to use a terrific bicycle whenever I wanted for 24 hours. An excellent bargain.as long as you park the bike within 30 minutes of checking it out, there is no extra charge beyond the $7 membership. several times I would stop and swap bikes within minutes, it's a minor hassle to enjoy such a flexible solution.You can take the L somewhere, grab a bike, tour, park, take a boat tour, grab a different bike, L, different bike, etc.... you get the idea. Bikes are plentiful and easy to find with the free smartphone app (I used the Android version, it worked flawlessly)riding along the lakefront is a wonderful way to kill some time and get some excercise."
Katiehustead,"Brooklyn, New York",5,10/30/2013,Best way to get around Chicago,"This program is terrific and very easy to navigate. We rode all over the city. It's a lot more fun than public transportation, and not expensive."
Rijos,"Druid Hills, Georgia",5,10/09/2013,Rent a Bike (DIV-VY),"Chicago has implemented a bike rental system that is super cool. You get your bike at one station and return it at another place. This are very confortable bike and easy to ride. The city has many bike lanes. It is a covinient and affordable way to move around in this city. Read the instructions well so you do not get a penalty fee.This are easy, affordable and covinient."

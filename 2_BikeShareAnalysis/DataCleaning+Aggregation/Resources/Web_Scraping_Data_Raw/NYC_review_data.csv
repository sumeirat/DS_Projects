Alberto R,,1,04/18/2019,"Legal fraud, bunch of crooks","Hired the bike for the first time last weekend to got to the park for a couple hours. Thought I'd pay 12$ or something for the whole day. Ended up being charged $47 for 2.5 hrs !! Called customer service and spoke with a super aggressive lady that wouldn't even let me speak. Obviously I was told that I had accepted the terms and conditions at the kiosk, hence I was on the hook. Not sure what the intent is to have such a service in the city - if it is to reduce pollution we are not moving in the right direction - I will never use it again ! This is what I call a legalized robbery..."
regjen79,"Waterloo, Canada",1,04/17/2019,I will never use Citibike again,"My husband and I wanted to spend the day exploring the cherry blossoms in Central Park. We had numerous problems with using citibikes. First of all we needed 2 bikes. We are from out of country so we’re only using my phone due to roaming fees. You can only rent 1 bike on your app??? What??? We had to use the kiosks to rent the other one and it wasn’t easy - took us about 10 minutes to finally get another one!! Now we only had 20 minutes before having to return the bike to a station (they only give you 1/2 hour before you have to dock your bike). Because you are not able to use your bikes on the smaller paths in Central Park, we rode for 15 minutes then had to walk our bike through a path to get to another docking station. Same deal - dock our bikes, get another code through the app, and takes a while before I could get the second one from the kiosk. So we ride again for 20 minutes then look for the next docking station. We get to it only to find there are NO BIKED available at that station. Yes we could ride to the next station but the app shows no bikes there either. And of course you are incurring extra fees of $4 for every 15 minutes you are over the 30 minute. Oh and on the kiosk - I could only buy a 3 day or week pass, not a one day!!! Again - WHAT?!?? So anyway we ended up walking for the second half of the day even though we had paid for a day pass!!! NOT user friendly, 1/2 hour is NOT long enough, kiosks need to be more user friendly (at every kiosk I had people asking ME how they worked), we incurred extra fees because we could not get to the next kiosk in 30 minutes. I really felt like this was a huge money grab and we did NOT get value for the money we spent. We likely actually rode the bikes for about 45 minutes and felt like we were always having to look for the next station. I would search a bike rental place next time and rent by the hour or day! Not cool at all Citibike!!!"
SavannahPool,Savannah,3,04/08/2019,"As a touris, a half hour is not enough",Need more time between getting a new bike. A half hour is not enough time. Spend too much time worrying about getting to the next bike and returning to a place that will have a docking station available. Love riding bikes during the weekend with less traffic but it is a hassle for someone who doesn’t know their way around. The bikes we rode were nice and easy to ride. Learning how to properly dock the bike is tricky. If I lived there it would be better.
vlynch123,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",5,03/21/2019,A great & affordable way to see the City!,"While on a 4 day trip to NY my husband and I were a little apprehensive about cycling in a big city but on day 3 we gave it a go and it was the best decision! Getting from A to B was so much easier and we opted to spend the extra and always used the electric models. The bikes were such a quicker option and by ensuring we docked every 30 mins we were never charged additional fees. We used them again on Day 4 to bike across the Brooklyn Bridge, a quick Pizza stop and bike back - an amazing experience with great memories!When we return next year we will get 3 day pass now we know how it works - make sure you download the App beforehand and get use to it - the map showing available docks & electric bikes is invaluable.Really good affordable fun! "
Nicola T,"Newport, United Kingdom",3,03/01/2019,Certainly an experience,"We rented two bikes to get us around NYC. As you can't hire two bikes via the app we had to do one online and one via the kiosk which was annoying but not a huge issue. We first took out the bikes to cycle back over Brooklyn Bridge which was lovely, there is a docking staton at the other side so this was nice and easy. Once we got into the city however, our experience changed somewhat. The roads are so so busy and so are the cycle lanes (which are hard to find even when you use the app). We ended up coming out of the city and cycling up from battery park to West 46th street along the side of the Hudson. This riverside park has a brilliant cycle lane and is much quieter and safer than trying to battle the traffic in the city.The bikes are very heavy and can tire you out easily if you aren't used to cycling.They are however, good value for money, easy to use and there are lots of bike parks. 30 mins is nowhere near long enough though!! I wouldn't recommend them in Central park as the bike lanes are very limited and cycling on footpaths is not allowed, plus, by the time you get into the park and get going, it's time to start heading out to swap the bike before your 30 mins is up!"
Charlie C,"London, United Kingdom",5,01/29/2019,Very good if a little expensive,"We were very, very impressed with the Citi bikes in New York. Yes it is expensive compared to other schemes but the cycle paths were brilliant, the app was very useful and there were docking stations every few blocks, so much easier to use than in London - I would strongly recommend. It is a far faster way of seeing the City than walking."
Getaway783051,"Coral Springs, Florida",3,01/16/2019,Meh,"We were excited to ride bikes in NY, but this Citi Bike System seems geared more towards locals. The system was confusing for us and thankfully a maintenance person happened to be nearby to help us pay for and unlock our bikes. The Citi System is good for getting from point A to point B, but that is all I would recommend them for. The bikes have to be ""re-checked"" out every 1/2 hour and it was difficult to find a station to do this is when you don't know the city you are in. Also the bikes were a bit stiff to ride with no turning radius. I guess I would recommend this to a local who needed a quick trip to work or the grocery. Not necessarily tourist friendly, IMO."
Beth S,,1,01/13/2019,Sh**ty bike,"Sh*tty bike! They’re always broken and customer service is non-existent, but sometimes it’s the best of bad options. Be better citi bike. I know you wont."
hamed808,"College Station, Texas",1,01/10/2019,Terrible experience,"It is terrible. I purchased a one day pass of 12$ and used the bike for 3 hours. It supposed to be returned every 30 minutes!!! However, my cellphone ran out of the battery and I couldn't find their rack to return every 30 minutes. So, they charged me an extra 60 dollars for that. It means I paid 72$ for just 3 hours. Citibike was my most terrible experience in the NYC."
Gordon F,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",1,01/08/2019,Scam,"We rented three bikes for one day on the 27th of December and the cost was $39 with tax. We returned the bikes within 24hr permitted period. On our return, we checked our credit card statement and there was a $39 charge and $108 charge for the 31st of December. We left New York on the 30th! We went to the Citi Bike website and they came back to us immediately and asked for a few details and then refunded us without any question. My worry is how many people bother to chase Citi Bike for the money 1 or 2 out of every 10? Who knows. Most people take it on the chin and put it down to experience. There are 68 million visitors to NYC every year. SCAM"
ehelas,"Ioannina, Greece",5,12/30/2018,The best way to see New York ,One of the best and cheaper ways to hang around New York. There are a lot of bicycles and a huge range of docks around the city. I think 30minutes rides are ok to go from one place to another.
tarnns8,"Brisbane, Australia",1,12/26/2018,Overcharged,"Been charged for 2 days rather than one and surprise, surprise the forms to lodge a complaint never open. Also charged another $4 on top of choosing the daily fee as we went over 30 min. What a scam."
Francesco A,,4,12/10/2018,Perfect way to enjoy NYC but be aware of extras,"We enjoyed Citibike a lot during three days in NY, we think it is the best way to visit Manhattan. Unfortunately, we were charged with extras while the extra time was indeed due to the impossibility of finding docks. We have asked to be refunded because it wasn't our fault, explaining the situation and giving our names and the names of overcrowded stations but the answer was somehow ignoring completely our issues."
SimonC14SRD,"Camberley, United Kingdom",5,12/09/2018,A brilliant way to see NYC ,"We always get citi bikes and now with the improved app and a network of cycle lanes seeing Manhattan has never been easier.  Simply down load the app, create an account and off you go.  Brilliant !"
Mark M,,5,11/20/2018,Sightseeing Brooklyn & Lower Manhattan,My first experience using this type of service. Found it easy to use and locations were everywhere we wanted to go. Simply loved the experience. Pedaled across the Brooklyn Bridge and explored lower Manhattan.
FWCritic,"Kelowna, Canada",5,11/11/2018,Completely Terrifying !!!! It was SOOO much fun though!!!,"I'm from Toronto originally, so biking in that city takes some getting used to but biking in a crazy city like NYC!?!?? You would either have to be diagnosed with a terminal disease and have only one day to live or have a death wish to die on 42nd and 8th ave if you decide to rent bikes in this city... my LORD!!! Everyone goes in every direction all the time, red lights mean nothing and everyone thinks honking at everyone will actually DO something. Well it doesn't.... The guy you're trying to teach a lesson to isnt getting it..... so get over yourself.We rented two bikes, and unfortunately this app will not let you rent two bikes at the same time.... so we had to use the app for one and the kiosk for the other..... so that is something they could change for sure.The bikes were in good condition, some better then others. The seats with the holes in them were less comfortable then the ones without. The basket in front had a strong bungee cord which held your stuff down pretty good.When we first got to the first station, we didn't know where to put the code..... your code will only have a 1 or 2 or 3 in it. And the key pad is on the left. The kiosk prints out a 5 digit code which after you enter it the light turns green.... HELPFUL TIP.... after it turns green, you have to lift up the bike a few inches so you can unlock it.... they don't tell you that anywhere either...... We didnt have any problems finding bike stations to pick up and drop off. The later in the day it gets however, certain stations around Time Square and Chelsea Market were clear out. I guess that's what the valet Service was for ? NOT sure....Helpful tip??? Try not to go over the 30 min time limit!!!!! IF you do, they charge $4 for EACH 15 min interval you run over. If you have to drop off and pick up right away, just wait to the two minutes to sign it out again. When docking your bike gently put the bike in and lift a few inches so it registers it and make sure the light turns green before you walk away.It's a cool way to see the city, I'm betting that I expended a LOT more calories then what they told you (that was a cool thing on the app) as my adrenalin was pretty high... I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at one point or another..... I would use this service again, it was a little less terrifying around Washington Square and in Greenwich Village, but midtown was not fun during rush hour..... yikes And good LORD buy and where a helmut!!!! "
RHINOTHOMAS,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",5,11/04/2018,Very efficient - nice way to see NY,Download the app and chose the option that works for your timing. One the one day pass ($12) you need to return the bike to the station after half an hour - not a problem as there are many stations. Good fun
DavidC9339,,5,10/31/2018,Sightseeing,Best way to get around Manhattan! Riding a bike from the Hudson to East River and crossing the Brooklyn Bridge is a must! Be careful not to ride over 30 minutes each time. Incan get a bit expensive.
Glex5000,"Tel Aviv, Israel",5,10/29/2018,"Efficient, technically well-maintained","Every tuime I get to the city I ride the Citibike- they're everywhere, it's quite straight forward, they're in a very good technical condition, there are endless number of stations, so you can always find one close to where you wanna go, and the support through the phone is quick and good. If you're here for 3 days, take the 3-day, and save $12. The 24-hour period is not calendar, but 24 hours from the minute you took them."
B3221GYlynnh,Port Coquitlam,3,10/09/2018,Be Aware of Extra Charges,"Recently returned from NYC and used Citi bike for our group of four tourists. While the initial process seemed very reasonable and easy, in actuality we had a few issues. 1. You have to ""dock"" your bike in every 30 minutes. This seems like a lot of time until you have trouble finding a docking station with room for your bike. For each 15 minutes in excess of the 30 minutes, there is an extra $4 charge which adds up if you can't find a space to dock your bike before you run out of time. You will have to ride to the next station, where the same problem may repeat. For example, our group was able to dock two bikes at one station, but there was no room for the extra two bikes so two of us rode to the next station. Then we had to walk between stations to meet up. 2. On our return trip we stopped to dock our bikes and found plenty of spaces which was good. Unfortunately, when we tried to release the bikes and continue, the card machine was not working and we could not unlock the bikes. Not to be deterred, we tried walking to the nearest Citi bike station...however, there was only one bike available there. We then walked to the next station and same problem, only two available bikes. At this point we gave up and called an Uber to take us back to our hotel. In the end, instead of an economical day of riding, we ended up with extra charges for the bikes and the cost of an Uber ride. Kind of a ripoff! On the plus side, the bikes were very comfortable to ride and in good shape. Not sure if we would use Citi bike again."
Infdaze,"New York City, New York",5,10/08/2018,Great Way to Get Around,"I use Citibike very frequently to get around for commuting and my daily life. This is a great way to go cross-town or avoid slow subway lines. Be a good rider and be aware of your surroundings, ride on the street and not the sidewalk, let people around you, and watch for people/vehicles on your sides. Be assertive for your safety and efficiency -- the safest place to bike is often in the middle of a lane, but move to the side when it is safe. Watch for people opening doors (especially from ubers/taxis) and taxi drivers moving to the curb to pick up hailers. Use the bell to alert others of your presence (including people jay-walking at crosswalks). The Citymapper app provides convenient directions for bike share."
Phyllis K,"New York City, New York",5,10/04/2018,Excellent Value and Mode of Commuting -NYC,I ride Citibike to and from work daily; the only negative is that sometimes there are not enough bikes when I start the trip; and I then walk a few extra blocks. This is still an amazing advantage over traveling by subways - for mental and physical health benefits. I suggest they add a few more bikes to their herd!
xbeatle,New York,2,09/29/2018,"Although I enjoy using the regular bikes, the ebike has been a major fail..","I visited the upper east side when they rolled out the e-bikes and have seen exactly 7 of them north of 72nd st.But wait, there's more..Each time I saw one, the red light was lit on the docking station..unusable..no explanation why the red light is always on when these things make their unicorn appearance.Someone's not doing their job and ruining the good will that Citibike initially earned.Don't over-hype something in NYC and not deliver on it fully..Just my opinion"
alexnadraf2017,"New York City, New York",3,09/29/2018,Great Concept ,"The concept of citi bikes is great! My business (dog walking) uses them for fast commuting from client to client. We use these bikes everyday, multiple time a day but as of late I feel the reliability and quality has gone down. Eight times out of ten there are either no bikes to be found or there are nothing but unusable bikes at stations. We were also so excited when they introduced the electric peddle assist bikes, but I almost feel like it’s a bad joke. Every time you find one at a station you are left disappointed to find that it is also red lighted and not in service. I feel they need to get a better system in place to keep high demand areas better stocked and keep good, usable bikes in service. Overall we like the service and will continue to use it, but would like to see it better maintained. "
TheSushiGuy,"Long Island, New York",4,09/25/2018,Cool Set Up,"I am very impressed with the Citi Bike operation. We were in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and saw quite a few of the stations. At 1am, we were dropping someone off in the neighborhood. The guy just rented the bike and rode off. I definitely would like to rent one in the future. "
uberUK,UK,1,09/23/2018,Be careful of confusing price structure!,On the surface this is one of those things that seems amazing and is a great way to see NYC but make sure you read the fine print before you sign up.It's advertised as $12 to hire a bike for a day but like many others what I didn't do is read the fine print and then got hit with unexpected and overpriced fees. We had 2 bikes out for 5 hours and this cost us almost $100! The system is purposely confusing and misleading (evident by the many reviews you can find on the net) so people get hit making the same mistake we did.At its core it's a great idea but at these insane prices it would be almost as cheap taking a taxi everywhere.
C4392VUchris,"London, United Kingdom",1,09/21/2018,Totally misleading information and a complete Rip Off!!,"Totally misleading information at the docking station and a complete Rip Off!! A fee for day hire, that is a fee for a days bike hire! Actually no.. Plus a fee for every minute after 30 mins! Confused? - We certainly were. The fact is that we could not re dock the bikes within 30 mins as there were not any docking spaces available at numerous docking stations in Red Hook, Brooklyn, NY therefore we could not avoid additional charges. You end up cycling around trying to get rid of the bikes, very frustrating, meanwhile every minute is costing you money. We ended up cycling back to the original docking station, hungry, frustrated and much poorer, don't use, take a bus, train, cab or walk! We used the 4 bikes for two hours, we only wanted them for 20 mins, it has cost over a $135.00!!I raised a complaint with the operators, had a 'Dear John' reply back.. Replied to them, checked on progress, informed by the operator the complaint is closed! Terrible customer service. All in all a terrible experience."
Berry785,"New York City, New York",5,09/19/2018,Great way to see NYC ,"My boyfriend and I just moved to Nyc, and biking around has been a fun way to gain our bearings. I would normally not have any interest in biking in the heat, but wanted to check out the electric bikes. After taking the bikes out a couple times we both got hooked, and just bought annual passes! With fall coming I can’t wait to bike around the different parks. "
631markrider,"Huntington, New York",5,09/16/2018,Visit Staff at plaza hotel fountain,Visit the staff in front of the plaza hotel and they'll show you how to use the bikes and give you an easy to read map. The entrance to central park is right there and once in the park you don't have to worry about cars. I did it today and with a bad back it was easy and the staff makes sure you won't have extra fees.It's hard to understand that some people think for $12 you get to take a bike to your hotel or wherever for 24 hours. Yes you have to return it every 30 minutes but there are stations everywhere a tourist would want to go and the staff make sure you know how to use the bike.
motorbodies,"Collingwood, Canada",4,09/16/2018,Easy transport,"Used the bikes for Central Park. Lot cheaper than the rental places, but you have to return them every 30 minutes. No big deal. Make sure you know where to switch bikes ahead of time or you may go over the time limit (we were close once). The kid at the kiosk outside CP was really helpful getting us started."
AriaLance,,5,09/13/2018,Best thing to do in NYC! ,"We just bought day passes from one of the guys selling passes in front of the Plaza Hotel. We went all over NYC... with bike lanes and CitiBike stations literally everywhere, there couldn’t have been a simpler experience. I would definitely recommend biking Central Park, biking to the Met from there, biking along the piers, and across the Brooklyn Bridge. We had the best day! I’m shocked at some of the reviews below. People seem to be complaining when they themselves don’t dock a bike correctly. The light turns green when you dock it right. Very easy. "
Rayanna85,,5,09/12/2018,Love Citi Bike :) Annual pass is amazing!,"I was going to buy a day pass but the nice guy with the citi bike hat let me know about the annual membership and 45 minute rides. I’m only here in New York for 2 months but it will actually save me money. I would be spending the same amount of cash at bike rentals companies for just 4 trips, but now I have UNLIMITED rides throughout the city! Thank you Citibike - best way to explore NYC :) "
avab896,,1,09/12/2018,Don’t give them your credit card info,"I rented a bike last week in Central Park with them which was fine; this was supposed to be a one time rental for an hour and was charged 3.27$. But now after two weeks there is another charge of 9.80$ for some sort of membership. I call this scam and abusing customer credit card information to sign them up involuntary for membership. Some of us have a super busy full time job and don’t have time to call and cancel unwanted charges, etc This is unprofessional"
Julia v,,1,09/06/2018,Terrible,"What a waste of money. After changing the bike 3 times we couldn’t take out all again. The office told me we hadn’t put one back properly. So you can just wait until someone brings it back. We waited 5 hours in which we could not use the bikes we paid for. Then it worked again, we used them and put ir back. Then again the same problem, although we checked on each to put it back properly. The lady on the phone let me feel like an idiot, told me we don’t know how to put the bikes back properly. We couldn’t use them till the next morning.I was very upset because I know we put them back properly and it didn’t work at all. Furthermore they purchased me 120$, the time someone else used the bike. Which should, if you call and tell that you’re not using the bike by yourseld should be stopped.In all I paid 4 bikes and a lot more and didn’t use them plus the customer service is very unfriendly. What a waste of money!!! Do NOT use them!!"
NoMoreMarriott,"Fayetteville, North Carolina",5,09/05/2018,Super Easy Fun!,The first day in NYC I walked everywhere but there is so much to see. I decided to try out Citibike so I could get around faster. It was great! Super easy and there are spots to park everywhere. I will do this again next time I visit the city-great bargain too!
katiebh2018,"Tulsa, Oklahoma",4,09/02/2018,Needs option for kids,"My older teen and I used this service and it was pretty fabulous. The price was good and it was relatively easy to learn the system. However it was hard to figure out how to rent two bikes because the app thinks it doesn’t offer that functionality yet. At the kiosk station near one of the checkouts it said, “do you want to rent another bike?” So it seems a little dumb the brain does not know what the hand is doing. Also it would be great to have some sort of indicator on the bike of how long you’ve rented it because checking a phone while riding is obviously dangerous. We have younger children who were not with me so it would be great if there were an option for kids to ride. Understandably that’s not their market but as one of the more legitimate rentals out-of-towners would appreciate that."
313billi,,4,08/27/2018,"Inexpensive, Easy to use, access and return","We used the bike to go around Central Park. This is a perfect application. Other vendors charge $15.00/hour. Citi Bikes is much less. These bike are easy to access and return. The bikes are a three speed bike so it is difficult to find the sweet spot for cycling in changing terrain. The bike seems to have more drag in the power train system than what it should be. This maybe connected to the generator to power the LED light around the bike.Having said that, they are perfect for use around the park. You can access them right outside the park, bike around the park, return the bike and be on your way."
MrVisittheworld,,3,08/21/2018,A perfect way of seeing real Manhattan,"A different but best way to visit all parts of NYC without using buses, subways and taxis. If you are flexible and an average biker, this is the way to go. We used the bikes with young kids however this is not really allowed, we have seen afterwards. Only from 18 years onwards."
William D,"Hartford, Connecticut",1,08/18/2018,Rip Off in NYC,What a rip off. The kiosk says $12.00 a day but I wish I read the reviews first. Many people had the same unfortunate experience as I. I definitely would NOT use again. As like buying a used car read the fine print! I called customer service and was told they are not for recreational use. In NYC??? Really?? Now as I see in previous reviews the manager will add some stupid response. Don’t rent use them AND the seats are set at the wrong angle. I kept sliding forward.
Arch C,"Northport, New York",5,08/16/2018,Best way to see the city - in multiple jumps,"Riding a bike in Manhattan takes away traffic frustrations and gives an intimacy with neighborhoods that you don’t get from a car/bus. I started at the tip of Manhattan. First hop was short, to the 9/11 memorial and the Oculus. Wow.Then up the west side bike path with all the great views. Another hop got me into and across Central Park. My route is not the key, the point is that I was able to do a segmented trip around Manhattan hitting many of my favorite spots. Just keep an eye on your watch so that you dodge the extra charge for going over 30 minutes. There are so many more docking stations than when I first used the system years ago. It’s amazing how easy and fun it has become. "
outlawsvg,"Toronto, Canada",1,08/13/2018,BE AWARE OF THIS COMPANY... Deceptive day pass,"There is NO SUCH THING AS A DAY PASS, I was billed $94 for 2 bikes for under 3 hrsBike rentals are in 30 min increments ONLY if you go over 30 min you pay for each additional 15 min, Boycott them"
YvetteTan,"Singapore, Singapore",1,08/09/2018,Waste of Money!!,"We rented Citiibike day pass to ride in Central Park and Hudson River. Eventually, despite the day pass $13 (with tax), we got charged an additional $48 pp for riding more than 30 mins per trip! I wish Citibike can be stated more clearly on their app about the extra charge while selecting the day pass ride! What make it worse will be the customer service lady, she will make you feel like an idiot of not reading terms and condition when you approached them... I believed I am not the only one who suffered, wish they have a much better customer service representative! It's just sooooo bad! Other than that, it's very easy to locate a bike, lock and unlock a bike..."
sccape,"New York City, New York",2,08/04/2018,buyer beware,"It is impossible to get out of a membership once signed up. Even if you move out of town with proof (most places accept this and are courteous enough to stop charging you for something you can't use). Bikes are very heavy. Rides are limited in time, eg 30-45 minutes. No guarantee there will be a bike at the station you are hoping for. Can turn into an awkward thing trying to swipe a bike much like taxis sometimes. A nice thought to have a bike share program in NYC but it needs some improvement here."
ketml,"santa fe, nm",1,08/04/2018,Waste of time and money,"We wanted to rent these seemingly nice bikes to ride through Central Park. I used the kiosk to buy the tickets for a ""24 hour rental"", only to find out after about the every 30 minute dock requirement unless you want to be charged more incrementally bases upon how far over the 30 minutes you go. Why on earth would we rent bikes for a 24 hour period and have to come back every 30 minutes?! Then the ""ambassadors"" showed up to the desk and told us of the alternative. Shouldn't one be there at all times to advise people? He said we could call the number on the kiosk to see if we could cancel that. Called, explained, denied. Terrible customer service on the call, and also there with the ambassador. By this time we had already wasted 20 of the 30 minutes so we docked the bikes and went elsewhere. Waste of $24 and our time. We just wanted to ride for an hour or two through the park, which no matter what we wouldn't have been able to do with the ridiculous 30-minute time limit. I saw the response about keeping availability of the bikes, but any time we passed by any of these rentals, they were always at least 3/4 full. I'd really like to get my $24 back. Because of this, I would not recommend. There are many other rental options for a flat time period and rate."
gcodoni597,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",4,07/31/2018,NYC,"The experience was really good! I just don't like that I had to change bikes during each 30 minute ride because I have to be really aware of this every 20 minutes or so because If not I'll be charge. Nevertheless, it is great!"
Keith F,"Long Beach, California",3,07/26/2018,Deceptive,"I enjoyed exploring the city on Citi Bike. We rode all the way from Central Park North to the South Street Seaport. However, my displeasure stems from the lack of information regarding having to dock the bike every 30 minutes to avoid additional charges. And yes, it's about $4/15 minutes! And no, you cannot get through Central Park north to south or south to north within half an hour... unless you don't want to stop to enjoy the sights within the park.But once we reached the Citi Bike Ambassador at Central Park South(across from The Plaza Hotel), we better understood the program and how it worked. The Ambassadors offer discount options if you download the app."
Ls2636,"New York City, New York",1,07/22/2018,Awful customer service and system,"My boyfriend and I tried three times before finally being able to find a station that functioned. One of the bikes’ tire blew out and we had to walk the bikes to a station nearby. If that isn’t bad enough, by chance, we returned the bikes we were finally able to rent at one of the stations that wasn’t functioning earlier in the night. We watched both bikes light turn green to signify they were docked, only to be told hours later that one didn’t dock. At 11pm at a night, after docking the bikes at 7:50, we were told our only option was to go back to the docking station and “redock” the bike, after being told by the agent they saw us attempting to dock the bike in the system. I have never in my life experienced a more flawed system, nor a more worthless customer service team. There was zero responsibility taken by the customer service team for the blown tire (poor service and maintenance), the non-functioning docking system (again, poor service and maintenance), or the way we were spoken to by the agents. I will NEVER rent a CitiBike again, or recommend to anyone."
WRLDTraveler2018,"Tampa, Florida",3,07/18/2018,Great experience but be can get costly,"My girlfriend and I went to New York in July and used the Citi Bike program. We got a one day pass (24 hours). The downside of the bike program is that you only have 30 minutes to use the bikes before they charge outrageous fees. The app works well for finding bikes and docks, but be mindful of the amount of time you have the bikes checked out so you don't get charged extra."
Royston C,,1,07/14/2018,Ride at central park a waste of money + time,The cocept of docking every 30 mins if not you get charged is ridiculous. You end up wasting more money and time riding around central park than walking.
angeliquevancamp,"Hamilton, New Zealand",1,07/12/2018,DON'T HIRE TO RIDE CENTRAL PARK,Just been pinged for a further USD38 because we didn't dock the bikes within the 30 minute time frame - there is no way you can ride central park like this so don't do it...pay a little extra and hire bikes from another operator. I feel totally ripped off as it wasn't clearly stated. I will never support them again as it's not at all tourist friendly.
124andrean,"Mira Mesa, California",1,07/09/2018,Be careful! It will cost more than you thought,"Be careful with the day pass! If you don't dock the bike after 30 minutes, they will double charge you for 2 days! Customer service is terrible! Don't even try this or you will cost you more money than taking Uber or taxi!"
285toby,"Brooklyn, New York",1,07/09/2018,dissapointed,"I loved my biking experience. my husband and I biked around twice. once by the brooklyn bridge park and once by long Island city park. it was wonderful. we were very careful to hit the biking station every 25minutes not to incur any unnecessary charges. later in the week as i was looking through my bank statement I saw a $4.36 fee. I called customer service and was told that i locked the bikes in at 32minutes. I asked to speak to an advisor so maybe she can do something on my behalf because it was really not intentional and it was my first time using those bikes and i wanted to really be positive about the experience. Also, I was maybe a minute late, but im human and its hard to hit the second mark, so it was so frusterating that i wasnt helped and after the phone call i felt so horrible the way i was treated by the supervisor. I mean, I might not have been a minute late, it just sometimes takes time until the bike gets locked into place which may have taken up these crucial few seconds to be charged extra. The woman I spoke to on the phone was pretty rude to me. I wish there would be someone i could speak to other than her to explain myself and to get a more understanding and helpful response.So overall my biking experience was great, but customer service and the supervisor was really mean to me."
ITravl4Fun,"Madisonville, Louisiana",4,07/02/2018,Convenient and easy,"We were in Manhattan for 3 days so I got the 3 da pass for $24. I found it easy and convenient to use. As some of the previous reviews stated, you will need to redock every 30 min on long rides. This just means you need to plan your route in advance. Get the app, set a 20 minute timer on your phone and you shouldn’t have any problems. There are lots of docks all over the city. I had no problems. One word of warning... take bags off bike before racking or at least make sure the straps of said bags aren’t locked in the rack with the bike. Enough said. "
Peter S,New York,3,07/02/2018,Good Service until there is a problem,"App would not work twice in a week. Customer Service basically said tough luck. When it works, it is very good. However, now it seems I can not rely upon it. They also often run out of bikes."
208juliusm,"Nut Tree, California",3,07/01/2018,Learning curve ,"They are fun to ride around the city, but you are limited to 30 minute rides. You need to plan for that and it takes getting used to but we made it work with just my wife and me. For example, to get from Midtown near Central Park to Washington Square, 30 minutes isn’t enough time if you obey traffic signals. Over 30 minutes it just keeps charging your credit card overage fees of $4 at 15 minute increments.Go figure a bank gets into bike rentals and figures out a way to charge you extra fees!!!But just like your credit and bank accounts if you keep close tabs and a nice cushion you can avoid extra fees. But sometimes crap happens even to the best of us and you get dinged. What sucks is if the place you planned to stop doesn’t have any empty docks. You can get a 15 minute extension to find another station but it is still inconvenient and it just kind of sucks. Most of the busy tourist places have a few dock stations within a few blocks but it still ruins your mojo.The other scenario that sucks is when you need to dock and there are no other bikes at that station. You don’t want to be a jerk but you also don’t want to give up the bike if you are trying to get somewhere. There is a 2 minute waiting period until you can check a bike out again, specifically so if someone is waiting they can take it. Fine if you are in a cool place but shady if it is dark out and you aren’t so sure about your surroundings. So you look at the app and try to stretch it to a station with more bikes...hope you make it on time!!!Overall, I would use it again but it might not be for everyone. "
Gene S,"Bainbridge Island, Washington",1,06/18/2018,"My wife and I got a one-day bike rental, it was, indeed, a trap",They say $12 for the day but if you don't put one of the bikes back within 2 hours (i.e. 2 hours and 32 minutes) you get a second charge of $39.20. Its a trick and outrageous...giving cycling in NYC a bad name.
Roz M,,5,06/17/2018,Works for me,Citibikes are to go from place to place. Easier and faster than walking. It’s a form of transportation versus a bike tour. It’s excellent for short rides. 
PopPrincesa,"London, United Kingdom",1,06/14/2018,"You will regret this, it’s a trap","For $12 a day, you are better off riding via Metro or walking. Only realised the mistake when I saw the credit card statement back home. Loved NY but the Citibike experience was the only one I truly regret taking part."
Philippo M,,1,06/10/2018,Absolute Joke,"My girlfriend and I rented the bike in Harlem and drove down the entire Central Park. There wasn't any advise at the citi bike station, that you have to bring it back within 30 minutes. So we have to pay 35 dollars now! I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY FOR RENTING A BIKE. Better try out others!"
Marioncoburn,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1,06/01/2018,Rip off,We used the bikes for one day. We were very aware of the 30 minutes time frame. 1st ride was 35 min and 2nd was 26 min. Was expecting an additional charge of $4 but got charged $26! No response from my email to Citibikes! 
adambP1878SF,"Paris, France",1,06/01/2018,"If the city cared about the environment, bikes would be affordable","One would think with all the problems NYC has with traffic and public transportation that it would do whatever it could to make alternative, efficient modes of transit affordable and available. This would be great if it were actually affordable."
Timothy M,,3,05/31/2018,Beware of learning curve and finicky hardware,"This is a good deal monetarily, but it takes a bit of patience and awareness. You must dock your bike every 30 minutes or get charged $4 per extra 15 minutes. We used full day use option, a good deal. To dock correctly, roll front tire into the docking station, and lift the rear of the bike by the seat until the lights on the docking kiosk light up and the kiosk shudders. Otherwise it will not register as being docked, and you will be charged. Plan your bike trip so you can easily reach another kiosk within 30 minutes. Once you get the hang of it, it generally works well. Any problems, call the Help number."
tobybeavers,"Largo, Florida",1,05/30/2018,CITI bike SCAM!,"Rented a bike for 24 hours. Just noticed a bill for $53...We called CITI Bike customer service...

But refuse to refund. I even got a notice my 24What a joke! What a scam. Who wants to dock their damn bike every 30 mins. Ridiculous!"
Krishna k,,4,05/28/2018,Great ride on citibike on New York streets but cautious of every 30 minutes docking when u t a day pass for new visitors,"We just thought to have fun with ride and see the beauty of the newyork streets .. it was soooo easy to book your bicycle with citibike using ur credit card and mobile number.. but only tedious part was docking back for each 30 minutes when u take day pass with rent of @12$+tax total 13+$.. If u don't dock ur bicycle within 30 minutes of ur each ride then u will be charged 4$ for each 15 minutes u spent after every 30 minutes of beginning of ur each ride.. which means we r forced to dock ur bike within 30 minutes time frame.. which makes u clicking clock in ur brain .. when u r a first time vistor u miss enjoying ride as u always forced to think of docking ur bike rather njoying ur ride... but u will get plenty of docking stations all the time in ur way where ever u rome in new York City..Except that u will enjoy a lot on bike ride..I suggest first time vistors at least do a one time bicycle ride in NY street for a first time visitor.. don't worry u have nice and plenty of dedicated line to ride in almost all streets.Regards,Krishna"
WMButt,,5,05/09/2018,Enjoy the views of the bridges,"We walked from Times Square to one of many Citi Bike kiosks in the city... we walked practically straight over on 42nd to 1st street then 1st down to 35th.The area between 41st and 38th is an empty lot and I would avoid the area after dark however, it was safe enough in the day.We rented it from the kiosk at FDR Drive & E 35 St and we rode down alongside the East River to Front St & Peck Slip... Google map directions state it's about 19 minutes however we took our time, stopped for water and took some photos so for us it was about 45 minutes...For us to dock where we did, you will have to cross the road just above Peck Slip... which is just after you get under the Brooklyn Bridge.It's a great way to see the majority of the bridges and just have a relaxing day in New York without the hustle bustle of the busy New York streets.I would highly recommend this for anyone going to visit New York and just do something outside of the steropical tourists, which we were anyways, but found out about this so it definatey took us out of that 'sterotype' mode.The online Citi Bike map is awesome to use and the mobile phone app is awesome as well because you can see how many bikes are at a certain kiosk as well as any open docks. Very easy to rent the bikes... most if not all rental areas are stations that accept credit cards; you get a code and then enter that code on any bike dock, remove the bike and awayyyyyyy you go!!!!"
CarloB117,"Piacenza, Italy",5,05/06/2018,"Good service, customer service very understanding",I’ve got a ride with my family in Central Park and it was wonderfull.Some rules in the rental are not so clear at the first sight so I invite to read it carefully and all works fine.To solve some trouble the customer services has been very quick and helpfull.
Vinclair,Amsterdam,5,05/04/2018,The ideal way to explore NYC,"Just terrific, cycling through Manhattan and Brooklyn. Clear bicycle paths all throughout, friendly traffic and the citibikes were all very comfortable. Picking up and returning the bikes couldn’t be easier. Highly recommended, especially if you’re an avid cyclist like me ;)"
Mozgolosky,"Toronto, Canada",5,05/03/2018,So Easy and So Useful!,"Make sure you understand the rules before you sign up!!!! I got a day pass for $12 USD and actually got 2 of them over the course of 48 hours because it was cheaper than buying all those single rides. Keep in mind that it's unlimited <30 min trips! All you have to do is bike for 29 mins and then put it into the dock, wait 2 mins, then take it out again! that simple! but if you don't, then you're just inviting insane charges on your credit card. I used it all day for 2 straight days and probably covered like 45 km biking around Central Park, midtown, downtown, Brooklyn and all the way up the west side highway, among many other neighbourhoods. It's so easy to use it's crazy! Also get familiar with the bikes before you set off. Some of the newer ones have an updated gear system where you just turn the crank and there's really no set gear it just progressively gets harder or easier, which I liked better than having 3 separate dedicated gears to go through. The seats were comfortable and easy to adjust if need be. No complaints. It was 100% more fun and easier and cheaper than riding the subway, but not quicker so keep that in mind. You can literally go anywhere you want with these things, there are 0 boundaries! and for that price, it is a no brainer!"
Jana S,,1,04/25/2018,Never ever again!,We rented two bikes for 12$/day each. What a shock when we discovered that you need to stop each 30min otherwise you are charged extra money for each 15min. We were using similar service in other cities but never experienced this.Next time we are definitely using other options (we saw a good deal close to central park 5$/full day with a different company).Really dissappointed :( Jana&Igi
dandanbsb,"New York City, New York",1,04/24/2018,Be aware!!! They steal your money!!,"So, I used to love renting a citibike to go around the city but what happened last Saturday really pissed me off. First, they said they were offering a “free” ride from 9 am- 3 pm because it was “Earth Day” so I decided to take advantage of it. I signed up, then received an email where I had to click on the link to get my free pass. I clicked on it and did everything it asked me to, which was basically get the app and sign up. Then there was no further instructions on the email or the app. I went ahead and used my card to get the bike because I figured they would link the card/ phone number with the pass I “downloaded”. I proceeded to enjoy the day and made sure I returned the bike before the 30 minutes went up so I wouldn’t get charged and even waited 2 minutes in order to get another bike. I returned the last bike around 2:40 pm. Made sure the light turned green, as usual and that was it. Then 2 days later, I looked at my bank account and there was 2 charges from Citibike, one for $13 and another one for $48!! I called to see what those were about and was told that the $13 was the daily pass. I explained I had signed up for “Earth Day” and she says “you should have called us so we could tell you how to get the code for that.” When I said there was no instructions telling me I was supposed to call, she said there was nothing she could do because I used the bike and I was supposed to have called. I let this one slide, even though I didn’t like the fact she can see I signed up for it and the hours I had a bike and still does nothing about it AND we’re supposed to guess what to do instead of receiving an email with clear instructions to call them, but whatever... I did use the bike, so that’s fine! When I asked about the $48, the lady said it was because I did not return the bike for 2 hrs!!! I DID!!! And I waited for the light!! I told her where I returned them and I even waited for the 2 minutes to get another bike!! She said all she could do was to refund me $8!! Are you serious??? This is so sad!! I used to love riding these in the city! "
MarkBalla,"Melbourne, Australia",5,04/23/2018,The only way and I mean the only way to see New York ,"What a totally and utterly sensational way to see Manhattan! I cannot overstate just how good this was. I covered around 50 miles in two days seeing more than I could possibly have seen walking or using the subway. This goes down as one of my best travel experiences ever and I have travelled a lot! Man! What city! Definitely, absolutely use Citibike!"
Brian M,,5,04/17/2018,A great service,I love these bikes. The best way to get around NYC. Service was easy to use and convenient. More bake stations would always be welcome. I highly recommend using these bikes.
jm53,"Portland, Maine",5,04/16/2018,"Cost effective, and after walking best value travel option for transversing Manhattan.","We got the $12 day pass. The pass allows for unlimited 30 minute or less rides. Take a few minutes prior to using CitiBike in becoming familiar with the smart phone app. This is a very powerful tool. App has a map that displays Citi bike stations. Will display in real time amount of bikes and docking spaces at each station.Used the Citi Bike app in conjunction with NYC department of transportation bike map app . NYC has made great strides in accommodating bicycle travel, and Citi Bike allows you to take advantage of this. For those uncomfortable riding in traffic there are numerous protected bike only paths that are clearly marked on NYC DOT bike map. Suggest prior to taking a ride know your destination station, Manhattan is very easy to navigate. In the event a station does not have any docking station there is an option to get an additional 15 minutes , although I never needed to use that option. If going on an extended ride you can always ride for 29 minutes dock bike.....wait 2 minutes get another code and continue riding. As a tourist didn't mind taking in the sites for a few minutes between rides. In the event you get distracted after receiving your code and you don't enter in time , get another code....that did happen to me. A tip I would like to share is that if you are going to Brooklyn use the Manhattan bridge as opposed to the Brooklyn Bridge. The Brooklyn Bridge on a nice day will be a massive wave of humanity that is difficult to ride through as many do not adhere to staying out of bike lane ! The bikes are heavy, sturdy ,and stable with adjustable seat post with markings that allow for quick setting when changing bikes. Bikes have a front rack that can hold a small day/backpack and be secured with a strap.Summary of our day pass was 6 rides for a total of 18 miles average time of ride 23 minutes. Bike helmets not supplied...bring your own !"

I want my money back because if it is a “day pass” why are there additional fees I wish I could give 0 stars IM NEVER BUYING EVER AGAIN AND IM GOING TO SPREAD THE WORLD AND REPORT THIS TO EVERYONE"
Brian R,,5,04/09/2018,Citibike is my favorite part of my 4 years in NYC!,"I have been using Citibike for 4 years in New York City for commuting, leisure, and when family/friends visit the city. It is such a great way for me to commute to work (2 miles through midtown, ~12 minutes). It is much faster, and a much nicer way to travel through the city than by car, bus, or subway. I really enjoy using Citibike to get around the city 7 days a week, and I love getting bikes with family and friends when they visit! It truely is a great way to see the city, as well as getting ""from A to B"" efficiently. I feel that any complaints I have read in these reviews are completely unwarranted, and have been made by people who have not read the agreement or understood the rules. Yearly members have 45 minutes bike rides included, while day trip users get 30 minute rides (before incurring additional fees). These rules are made very clear before purchasing anything. There is a deposit that will be held on your credit card, similar to when you rent a hotel. This is a necessary part of the program.  The Citibike app lets you know exactly where the bike stations are, and how many bikes/stations are available to help you plan your rides in advance. I have had only one or two issues in 4 years with citibike, and have been promptly helped by Citibike staff over the phone. If the 30 minute time limit does not suit your needs, I would plan on paying overage fees, or finding alternate transportation. Citibike really isn't suited for long, leisurely trips. I see it a more of an efficient method for people to get around the city - while enjoying being outside and getting exercise. Hope this helps answer some questions people may have!"
Zaki H,,1,04/06/2018,Huge RIP OFF - Better off walking 100%,"Rented a bike, first of all the code for the rental disappears after like 10 seconds and they dont tell you that you'll need it in the future and instead of texting you the code they text you some other useless information that you dont need. You then spend 15 minutes trying to get the code to unlock the bike that you already paid for. After that, you take the bike out (which had sticky residue on the handle bar) and you can enjoy it for about 10 minutes or so before you have to worry about finding another citibank bike location to return it in. GOD FORBID YOU ARE 7 MINUTES LATE TO RETURN IT YOU WILL GET CHARGED 35% OF THE RENTAL COST. After calling and nicely asking them to wave it, i got told to pound sand and that i am liable for all the charges. USELESS SERVICE ALL AROUND."
dlocke49,"Richardson, Texas",1,04/03/2018,RIP OFF BIG TIME!,The 30 minute time limit thing is ridiculous. You never know how much they are charging you even when you bring the bike back within 30 mins. This is another scam for tourists. I am going to fight them tooth and nail to get my money back. They over charged me $100. Crazy. Don't use these bikes or you will get ripped off!!!!
GlobetrotterDK1967,"Charlottenlund, Denmark",5,03/30/2018,Citi Bike is the best thing in NY,"I can highly recommend Citi Bike as it is easy to use and come with an app with maps over all Bike routes in and around NY. 12,000 bikes to use all over the citi. Be street smart and change the bike every 30 min and it will cost you less an $10 a day. Love it. "
digital_niche,,4,03/29/2018,Cycle and scenery,"The bicycle rentals are easy (with a credit card) and a good way to see more in less time. Cycling through the city might be a bit tricky and dangerous if you are not confident. The route along the Hudson is a better alternative to navigating through city streets or even the very crowded central park route. Just familiarise yourself with the stations to revalidate. I did not have the app on my phone, but it would be a great help and recommended."
RoeckeWilli,"Ithaca, New York",5,03/12/2018,Be sure to load the Citibike app on your phone,Used Citi-bike to get back and forth between Columbus Circle and West Village. It was breeze.

Thinktravelj,"Lakeland, Florida",5,02/16/2018,Riverside ,The bike rentals in NYC are a good way to travel but you are under a rental clock. Spontaneous stops are limited but a summer ride is a good thing to do in NYC. Citi bikes are maintained regular so it’s a less risk than random bike shop. Get fit. Have fun. Bike fit on vacation. 
TalithaMM,"Arnhem, The Netherlands",4,02/14/2018,Ideaaal!!,Perfect way to go around NY!! You do have to return to a check point every 30 min but they are everywhere :)!
trainman2017,"Lancashire, United Kingdom",2,02/13/2018,30 minutes not long enough,"This is a great idea. But this issue I found was that some locations (not always tourist areas) had so few bikes. On one occasion I was nearing the 30 minute mark, so went to ""re-hire"" the bike only for a local who had the Annual Pass and therefore a ""button"" to unlock the bike take the bike from me when I was trying to re-enter my details on the machine. As there were no other bikes for hire, I then had to walk to another location to get a bike.First time I was so shocked I didn't know what to say. The second time I was prepared, I saw what was about to happen and made a scene. The guy was so shocked I ended up getting ""my"" bike.It is also very easy to go over the 30 minutes and get hit with the additional charges.As a concept it is great idea and I loved cycling in Central Park and down the side of the Hudson River. I think one hours hire would be more useful."
Anthonycsz,,1,02/05/2018,Please beware. Ripoff. Scam,I visited ny city with my wife... we used city bike a couple of times always careful not to pass the 30 minute barrier. On my credit card the surprise was astonishing. Over 120 euros. Absolute rip-off. The worst thing is that you cant do anything about it. Never again. I absolutely recommend you keep away from this service. They will charge your card
Erin S,"Gold Coast, Australia",4,02/05/2018,"Easy to get around, Great value for money!","I'm a bit of a fangirl when it comes to riding bikes through new cities. What better way to explore a city than on a bike? New York citibikes will set you back just $12 (plus like $1.50 tax) for 24 hours of unlimited riding. All you have to do is download their app and buy a day pass. The app shows you where all the citibike stations are on a map and you can go to anyone you like a pick out a bike. You use a code on your phone to unlock the bike and off you go. There is one catch with the day passes. You need to dock the bike every 30 minutes or you will be charged $4 for every 15 minutes extra you spend on the bike. I guess this is done to curb cases of damaged and stolen bikes. It's not so bad to dock them every 30 minutes as there's so many citibike stations around New York. 24 hours of bike riding for $12 is a pretty great deal. I would recommend going to the west side of the island near the cruise terminals and grabbing a bike there. The bike path that runs along the West Side Highway is smooth and easy to navigate, plus the views are amazing. Ride down the West Side highway, through Battery Park and onto the Brooklyn Bridge. If at any point you get sick of riding you can always dock your bike and catch a subway to wherever you need to go. I would highly recommend using citibike while you're in NYC, like I said before the only downside is the 30 minute rides but it's okay as long as you keep an eye on the time."
farahh706,"New York City, New York",5,01/30/2018,Biking NYC!!,"We don't have bike share where I'm from so I did need convincing from my friend who lives in NYC. Thankfully she did, because citi bike is a fun way to see the sights around Central Park and you can leave the bikes right by all the major museums. Just make sure you see the green light when you return the bike and you don't get charged extra. Not hard and more fun than car traffic and angry cab drivers. "
Pavly D,,5,12/31/2017,best way of transportation in NYC,Perfect way for transportation in such a traffic jammed city..but watch your time to not exceed your 30 minutes ride or you can dock your bike and take another bike to open a new 30 minutes
237dk,"Armonk, New York",5,12/19/2017,Sweet system,"Rode over the Brooklyn Bridge at dawn on my first Citi Bike experience, then over to the 911 memorial. What a sweet system. I totally loved it. I suggest looking for bikes with the rotating black gear shift and not the little silver dial. Check the lights before you go. Thirty minute check in is a little tight but workable. Just a beautiful idea though. "
Xavier C,"Kyoto, Japan",5,11/27/2017,I love Citi Bike,"Having been a CB member since the launch, I’ve logged more than 2000 rides, totaling 3600+ miles, which has accounted for 484 hours of exercising moderately and burning an estimated 155,000 calories. All that and it’s much less than $0.50 per ride - where can you get such a bargain? Yes, it is important to be aware of drivers - but now with so many of us out there, we have mostly taken our rightful share of the roads. It would be great to have more bike lanes that are protected by parking lanes ... but I guess de Blasio does not feel the “ownership” that Bloomberg did- so it does not seem like further expansions are to be forthcoming. Too bad, but it’s still an excellent addition to our transportation network. Hurray for Citi Bike! "
Matthew W,,5,11/13/2017,THE BEST WAY TO GET AROUND NYC!,"Citi Bike is the fastest, safest way to get around NYC. It's the perfect way to explore if you're a new visitor the the city. I've been a member for 5 years and I love it. You can of course buy a daily pass too if you're visiting. But Honestly Citi Bike is best for when you get out of the subway and instead of walking 20 minutes to your final destination, you can bike there in 5min! It's a huge time saver. And if you're worried about safety, don't be! The bikes are designed for you to sit higher up so cars can see you better and New York has some of the best protected bike lanes in the world! oh and the Citi bike App on the App Store or Google Play store keeps you up to date with real time counts so you always know where to dock you bike!"
WILLIAM L,"Miami, Florida",4,11/11/2017,Visiting a friend in NYC for the week.,"This is my second time using Citi Bike. This is the fastest, most economical way to travel around Manhattan. I bought a 3-day pass and it was an enormous value for me. I love the convenience of picking up the bike and dropping it off very quickly then being on my way to whatever activity. The only drawback for me what's some kiosks, for some strange reason were shut down. This left me to have to go to the next kiosk in the neighborhood. The great thing is the app for the smartphone shows you where the kiosks are in your proximity and if they have a bike or a dock where I can leave the bicycle. The latest bicycle model available, allows you to adjust your speed without being limited to only the previously 3 speed increments. This allows you to take hills with ease. I bought a bike helmet at the Goodwill before I came to New York and I leave it at my friend's place for me to use. All in all I'm a very satisfied customer. I just received a $6 discount now for my next rental!"
southernhiker,"Raleigh, North Carolina",5,11/10/2017,Great way to get around Central Park at night,"Due to this being a business trip to NYC, we only had our evenings free. I wanted to visit Central Park and loved the idea of renting CitiBikes to view more of Central Park than if we were walking. The app was downloaded and we picked out our bikes after being given a code to unlock them. At first we couldn't figure out how to turn on the headlights, but then realized that the headlights and taillights turn on automatically when you start pedaling. There was an open basket up front that had an elastic band to tie things down. Yes, if you don't want to be charged more than the $12 day rate, you need to take it back to a bike station every 30 minutes. This was not an issue for us as there are stations all over the outskirts of Central Park. Fun experience that we would recommend to others. "
Julia V,,1,10/31/2017,"HUGE LETDOWN, charged for their mistakes","LOVE the concept of a bike sharing program, but was VERY disappointed with citibike and their customer service. I was charged $164 because the sensor on the bike rack did not register that the bike had been returned. When I contacted customer service to find out where the charge came from they told me they could only refund me $60 of the $164 charge, even though the mistake was due to a faulty sensor/locking system on their bike racks. To make matters worse I rented three bikes that day for a 24 hr period, we were only able to use the three bikes for one trip. As we tried to unlock the bikes for a second trip, it only gave us one access code for one bike, so we paid for three bikes but only received one. VERY disappointing, not just that we werent able to use the bikes the full period we paid for but that citibike was unwilling to work with me to fix their mistake."
Anthony M,"San Francisco, California",2,10/28/2017,Not for tourists. Overpriced!,"I'm an avid bike rider and commute to work daily. Citibike advertises itself as a great opportunity for tourists but that's a joke. My daughter and I paid $12 each for a daypass - unlimited 30 minute rides. But the distances you can actually GO in 30 minutes are fleeting. 2 of 3 rides ended up being over the limit. One was 33 and one was 32 minutes. For that extra 5 minutes, we were charged $8.71 each. (They stuck tax on the $4 overage each time.)"
jeathrey,"Clinton, Connecticut",5,10/28/2017,Citibiking From Harlem to Brooklyn ,"For just $12, saw a lot of great sites in NYC! Started at Harlem 125th docking station, made way to Central Park. Plenty of docking stations to return bike every 30 minutes so as to not incur additional fees. NYC is really bike-friendly with plenty of designated lanes, just use your Citibike app to see where the lanes are. After hiking around the Park, ended up taking subway to City Hall and then grabbed Citibikes for a trip over the pedestrian-congested Brooklyn bridge...use your bell to clear the way! Then rode around picturesque Brooklyn neighborhoods that were all decked out for Halloween, along waterfront for amazing views of lower Manhattan, then into the cobblestone streets under the Brooklyn bridge. After footing around there, got a Citibike and headed back over the bridge. Highly recommend using Citibike if you’re looking for a fun, new, inexpensive way to see the city! Make sure you have the app and be diligent about watching your time and having an idea of where you want to go so you don’t incur those extra fees after 30 minutes! Happy Citibiking!"
V4531HPtimc,"London, United Kingdom",5,10/28/2017,Excellent well managed system,I come from London and we have a similar system that I do use relatively frequently. First time using citibike and found it an excellent service. Plan your trips. Nyc is easy to navigate and you can get quite a distance in 20-25 mins Leaving plenty of time to find your dock and walk to the next station if you need to travel further. 
FRENCHTOAST81,"Bayonne, New Jersey",2,10/25/2017,EXPENSIVE HOUR BIKE RIDE... 30 MIN RIDE..DOCK IT IF AVAILABLE SO YOU WONT BE CHARGED!,"Please read the fine print and understanding on the citibike, If you are renting for the first time. You are only ALLOWED 30 MINUTES at $12.00 plus tax to ride the bike, after 30 mins you MUST dock the bike and pick up another bike, If you KEEP the bike longer than 30 MINUTES , you will be AUTOMATICALLY charged $4 per every 15 minutes over! Paying $26.00 FOR AN HOUR BIKE RIDE IS A RIP OFF! NEVER AGAIN. "
DonTomasdeLA,Los Angeles,5,10/17/2017,Learn how to use and ENJOY,"my friend and I spent 6 days using citibikes in September. Like so may say, it was a major highlight of our trip. We did two 3 day passes and purchased the $5 keys so we didnt have to use codes. It's true you can only ride in 30 minute segments but we planned trips and the bikes are EVERYWHERE. Only a few of our trips took two segments. Whenever possible take the westside bikepath along the river. It is very fun and QUICK. Granted we had great weather but we plan to take Citibike whenever we are in NYC again. It was fun and saved us a TON of money. We were in midtown and could go downtown in about 11 minutes. People who complain here did not bother to LEARN how to use the system. Downloading the app and reading beforehand helps a lot. If you are uncertain, try for 24 hours. You will never have more fun in NYC for $12. TRY IT."
joanieb52,"Hopkinton, Massachusetts",1,10/12/2017,Used Citi Bike to follow someone on 18 mike run,Very inconvenient. Needed to find docking stations every 30 min and then had to wait 2 minutes to take another one out. Final charge was $30.44 for 3 hours...missed 2 docking stations by 3 minutes and the last docking station by 20 minutes because the station in central park was closed due to an event going on.Do not take out if you are going longer than 30 min!!!
Noah W,,1,10/04/2017,Crooks,"What a racket. They charged me an extra 17 bucks so I could do tem a favor and take the bike to an empty location went the place I went to take it back was full and so was the next one. Ended up paying the price of an unlimited metrocard 7 day pass for 2 45 minute bike rides. Not worth it. No text about it being late, nothing. Greedy. Should have know by something run by Citi bank, they make all their money on late fees just like a bank."
Karen C,,1,10/03/2017,WORST WASTE OF MONEY,"The Bikes are super heavy. If you're below 5'2 you will barely reach the floor even with the seat all the way down. You have to worry about docking it every 30 minutes.

What a waste of money. Do Not get!"
Sacca62,"Brisbane, Australia",2,10/01/2017,Just don't us it more than 30mins at a time,"While it appears great value @ $12/24 hrs, it's unlimited 30 min trips, not continuous use for 24 hrs - got a nasty surprise on my credit card arriving home ($87) after using it for 1 1/2 hours on Governors Island, now I know why nobody else was using them. When contacted, they agreed to halve the charge. More suited to locals going point A to B, not tourists ambling around for a few hours. Signage could be a bit clearer on this"
danielrW3499PQ,"Windsor, United Kingdom",5,10/01/2017,Great trip,Easy and efficient service great way to experience New York. Had a wonderful time exploring and would highly recommend it to anyone travelling to New York
LarrRose,"Perth, Australia",5,09/30/2017,Made our experince of New York,"Best thing to do in New York, after a while, you feel like a local. The bike paths were really planned out especially along water/ pier areas.A couple of scary moments in the heart of the City - from city walkers, not cars.Caught a few celebrities riding Citi Bikes - Leonardo.Doing this activity was the highlight of the New York experience."
I606BVpeters,"Hook Norton, United Kingdom",5,09/24/2017,Great experience,"Had. Few hours to spare after a business trip, so staying in Queens I booked a $12 day pass and had a great time cycling over Queensboro bridge, around Central Park, went to the Met, Mid town etc. Really handy and easy to use. Great way to see New York. Impressed with how many Citibike stations there are and the bike lanes. Go for it."
nicolastrachan77,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",5,09/21/2017,The best way to get around Brooklyn,"I have hired similar bikes to this in London so was looking forward to trying it in New York. We had done an organised tour in Manhattan the day before to get our cycle legs and negotiate the extra busy tricky areas. We were staying in Brooklyn and used the bikes to tour Brooklyn, down the Hudson River and to Williamsburg and Greenpoint. The bikes were very simple to use, gears changed easily and were in good condition. There were always bike docking stations within 30 minutes of each one so we had no problem finding a suitable one. Make sure that you know roughly where they are but if you stick to cycle routes there seemed to always be stations. You have to wait 2 minutes between each docking however this gives you time to have a drink and check the next location. On one occasion there were no free docking stands but a quick cycle to the next soon solved that problem. I know some people bemoan this fact but I paid £14 for 24 hours for 2 bikes, travelled miles, visited areas I would not have got the subway to and had a great day. It is nice to be able to dock your bike and leave with no responsibility for it - time for a quick coffee and then back to a new bike. The routes we used were always busy with people and bike certainly seemed to have right of way where we were. I would hire one of these every time I go!"
AndreaSteph1970,"Blackburn, United Kingdom",1,09/20/2017,"Horrendous customer service, docking machines not working and spurious charges made","In theory this is a good way of getting around the city. IN practice, absolutely terrible. We hired 3 bikes on a Saturday and then all the machines where you need to re-dock every 30 minutes all went down. We wasted time trailing to 5 different machines and eventually gave up. When contacting customer service on return to the UK, they are absolutely appalling; ranging from not replying, then replying requesting the same information on numerous occasions and then failing to find our account or any accurate information about our spend. Ended up reporting them to the fraud dept of our credit card company for not refunding but worse still, for adding many spurious costs - don't touch with a barge pole"
gregh53,"Kansas City, Missouri",2,09/19/2017,Watch the fees over 30 minutes of uses,"We rented Citi Bikes while in New York. The fee structure is not well explained at the kiosk. We thought we were paying $12 for a ""day pass."" What is not clear is that it is $12 for a day of 30 minute rides. This is nuts. You need to ride from kiosk to kiosk to return the bike so you can ride for another 30 minutes? I was surprised to see a charge for another $117.50 for usage fees when I got my credit card bill today. Deceptive advertising in my opinion. Beware."
Érika H,,2,09/18/2017,"Good choice, few seasons to leave the bice every 30 min","The cycling experience in New York is great. Unfortunately we rented the bike one day and as there were no nearby stations (with free parking places), the half hour ride was impossible, we paid more for late penalties than for the whole day of service. Brooklyn is a bad idea Citi Bike in Manhattan is better, but the risk is that you arrive at crowded stations and you can not leave the bike and end up paying $ 4, $ 8, $ 12 penalty. Half an hour each time is a very bad idea, would be better 45 minutes, so give time to track stations with free places to leave the bike without suffering what I and my friends live.La experiencia ciclista en Nueva York es estupenda. Desafortunadamente alquilamos la bici un día y como no había estaciones cercanas (con lugares para estacionar libres), el recorrido de media hora era imposible, pagamos más por penalizaciones por demora que por todo el día de servicio. En Brooklyn es una pésima idea la Citi Bike, en Manhattan es mejor, pero el riesgo es que llegas a estaciones llenas y no puedes dejar la bici y terminas pagando $4, $8, $12 de penalización. Media hora cada vez es una muy mala idea, serían mejores 45 minutos, así da tiempo de rastrear estaciones con lugares libres para dejar la bici sin padecer lo que yo y mis amigas vivimos."
James r,,4,09/10/2017,Very nice,Absolutly great ... spend the $5 for the bike key wwweeeellll worth it .i only wish the whole dock the bike every thirty minutes would stop... annoying
Dianne G,,5,09/05/2017,So convenient and economical,Alfonzo was such a help.  He signed us in and make sure we didn't choose the option where you had to return the bike every 30 minutes.  It worked out great.  The only downside was those hills on the north side of Central Park. LOL!
ScotAllen3,"Princeton, New Jersey",4,09/03/2017,Ride=Awesome/Rental=Caution,"One of the greatest ideas for getting around the city ever. Healthy, highly available and will kept bikes in an increasingly bike friendly city.That being said cautions include1 bring your own helmet 2 bikes don't always dock so you are charged overage if you don't dock properly. 3 watch your time it's$4 for every 15m over your allotted 30m segment. I accidentally didn't dock it fully and the bike was missing for 24hrs. CitiBike had a great call center and when the bike was returned I was credited the overage of$139.Get the bikes because they are awesome just be aware and follow the rules."
ari449,"New York City, New York",5,08/30/2017,Citibike Service,Big shout out to Tammy Evans of Citibike who runs the valet docking station at the Plaza Hotel location on 56th and 5th. I'm an annual member and she goes out of her way to help and make sure that the valet station there runs properly. She also walked over a replacement card to my office one day when the old card stopped working. Other valet stations sometimes get full and they don't indicate it on the app but Tammy always make sure they can take your bike there (to avoid the stress of not being able to find a station) so you don't get stuck.
Teryn_LLGT,United States,3,08/28/2017,Don't get overcharged! ,"Apparently there is some small print on the side of the Day Pass terms that you get charged extra if you keep it for more than 30 min at a time. I ended up being charged $26 because I kept the bike for an hour! How dumb is that to have to check-in/check-out a bike every 30 min just to avoid extra fees on a DAY PASS. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has been confused by this, they should make the Day Pass terms more clear. Besides all of that, the bike was a convenient way to bike around Central Park. "
Louise M,"Stroud, United Kingdom",3,08/24/2017,Central Park,We hired bikes from Citi bikes but you have to check in every 30 minutes or you get charged.. so you have to look for a check in area every 20/25 minutes and they are located off Central Park.. which ruined it for us...too much of a tie...wouldn't recommend 
Mll351,"New York City, New York",4,08/24/2017,Can be GREAT....Here's LOCAL advice before you choose this option,"I've been using Citibike since it first started and am a long time NYer. Citi Bike NYC is not for everyone. Some of it is Citi Bike's fault. Some of it is New York's fault. Below is a guide to help you decide if it's right for you.1) 30MIN LIMIT (under 1 year pass)/45MIN LIMIT (annual Pass). The Bike is really cheap, except if you hold it for more than 30 minutes. This is great if you are using Citibike as an alternative form of transport from the subway. Less great if you are hoping for a long bike ride through the city. 2) DON'T USE CITIBIKE FOR THESE ATTRACTIONS: Central park riders will think Citibike is a comparable option to bicycle renters that dot the area. In some ways it is, because the rental companies often charge $30 for 4 hours and you won't likely need the bike the full 4 hours. Central Park is a 6.1mile/10km loop provided you know where you're going. This is a 3 speed, heavy leisure bike. It's actually quite aggressive to try to get around all of Central park in 30 minutes. You can likely find a citibike, get around 2/3rds of it, find a docking kiosk depending on how you plan. A little aggressive, but possible. There aren't Citibike Kiosks yet in Central Park, so you'll be biking in and out, i.e. traffic lights. West Side Highway is a better bet, but watch the clock. Due to weight, traffic lights, and limitations of the bike, I think from 60th Street to Chinatown is the most I can do in 30minutes (about 3.5-4 miles) including undocking/redocking the bike. But I am a marathon runner, who trains regularly for competitions and I know where I'm going and where the kiosks are.3) NO HELMET vs. HELMET. NYers are notoriously bad for using no helmet. At the current moment, you will not get ticketed for failing to use one. 4) BIKE LANES & TRAFFIC RULES. Sometimes you have to ignore them if you don't plan on dying. The US Is behind European Countries for bicycling. The way cars and pedestrians behave, it's more like China, circa 1990 or the Emerging countries of Asia. You have to stay alert. That makes it wild and fun for some, but scares the pants off of others.5) THICK SKIN FOR PEOPLE YELLING AT YOU. NYers are yellers. Cabs, pedestrians, and other bikers will often all exercise their freedom of speech to strongly in their communicate their opinion of one's biking skills. You want to have a humorous attitude toward this and see it as part of the show. 6) BEST AND WORST HOURS. If you're still not deterred, realize that rush hour is the scariest time and early morning (before 7am) is the most serene time. 7) AVOID TIMES SQUARE AND HERALDS SQUARE UNLESS THAT IS YOUR DESTINATION. Even the cars avoid these areas. If you bike in these areas, your issue is pedestrians and they are extremely clueless (sorry... I love you visitors, but you guys tend to be looking up at the buildings, walking in zig zags and at odd angles across the street and it's hard to know what to do on bicycle behind you).8) DOWNLOAD 2 APPS TO HELP YOU. Citibikenyc will tell you in advance whether you're going to a kiosk station with no bikes. This will save you from getting there and burning minutes trying to find an open Kiosk. If there are only 1 or 2 slots, I would not chance it. Citymapper will tell you how long it will take an average cyclist on a heavy citibike can get there. Even if you are a competitive biker, realize pedestrians, construction, and more can get in your way. Until you get a good sense for your timing relative to Citymappers estimates in bicycling, trust Citymapper. 9) DO NOT BICYCLE ON SIDEWALKS. It's way better to bike against traffic than it is to ride on a sidewalk. Pedestrians are more dangerous than cars in this city and you are in the wrong if you hit them vs. a car which will always end up with the ticket. 10) EASIEST CITIBIKE ROUTES. If you just want to check this out and need a path that won't incur overages, get the 24 hour card. Ride along West Side Highway (WSH) doing all the attractions along the Hudson River in order. WSH is by far the safest route, as there are no cars, just pedestrians and other crazy bikers for most of it. Also, you can get a bike at Cityhall or Chinatown and go over to Brooklyn Bridge (preferably before 10am). Park your bike in Brooklyn and check out the water front. Then Ride back on the Manhattan Bridge. Each bridge is 1 very hilly mile. The Manhattan Bridge is slightly less steep and a lot less crowded. If after 10am, walk over the Brooklyn Bridge. May not be as fun to ride it."
ianblane,"Ardsley, New York",5,08/24/2017,"Understand the rules, and you will love Citi Bike.","I saw that almost all the one star reviews had the same complaint. They did not know of the 1/2 hour limit per ride, and they did not know about the credit card hold. In all fairness, this can be a major problem for those that do not know about it. Frankly, a tourist would likely be better off with a rental from a private rental company where they can have the terms clearly explained to them. However, if you live or work in NYC, there is no better bike option. All bikes are in good to great condition, and they do exactly what they are designed to do - give you access to a bike for a short commute within the city. Having the App is essential since it is the only way to know where the bikes are, and where you can dock them when you are done. I found customer service to be completely professional whenever I call and I have no complaints. The Citi Bike has saved me thousands of dollars in the years that I have been using it, and given me hundreds of hours of pleasure! Know the rules before you go, have the app on your smartphone and enjoy!"
chubbco,"Santa Barbara, California",5,08/24/2017,Citi Bike lets you feel the city like no other.,"I lived in NYC in the 70s and thought I knew it. Citi Bike has opened a new city to me. If you're visiting and are thinking about Citi Bike I urge you to try it. Be careful but don't be afraid. It's the greatest way to get around and to see New York. Check the pricing on the passes, I come to NY often enough that I have an annual pass so I don't have to worry about it, but reading the other reviews, I can see that some people got surprised b/c they bought the wrong pass (the ""day pass"" sounds like you're renting a bike for the day but you're not!),"
vernona719,"Silver Spring, Maryland",5,08/16/2017,A great way to get around NYC,"I am a confident commuter cyclist but was very leery of riding in NYC. After passing up several chances in the past, on a free efternoon i bit the bullet and rented a citibike hoping to have time to take in more of NYC tha i vpuld manage on foot. What a great choice. Renting the bike with a credit card was straightforward. I rode up to Central park and turned the bike in, you can't keep the same bike for over 30 min w/o incurring a surcharge. After looking at the statues, i checked out another bike (no new charge, the rental is good for 24 hrs.) And had the most pleasant ride around the park. Again i checked in the bike on cental park west. After scoping out a marked path to the Hudson River greenway, i checked out another bike and headed south, a pleasant ride on a multi use pathway. I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable and functional the 3-speed bikes were. The seats are easily adjutable to approximate a fit. There are no significant hills that require a lower gear. I will certainly plan to use Citibike as an alternative transportation when returning to NY."
Rich S,"Delray Beach, Florida",5,08/14/2017,We LOVE Citi Bike. Don't make the mistake the bad reviews made and you'll have a blast!!,"We were in NYC to see a concert this week (August 10, 2017). We were near Central Park and decided to rent a Citi Bike. We made the same mistake the people in the bad reviews did, and I understand why they're unhappy. Pick the wrong rental plan and you'll be charged a small fortune. Citi offers a 'Day Pass' and an hourly pass. The Day Pass is not what it sounds like. It is meant for frequent short (30 minute or less) trips throughout the day. It's meant for locals running errands, shoppers, commuters, etc. Keep the bike for longer than 30 minutes and they charge you $4 every 15 minutes. The Day Pass is not what you want when you're on vacation, even though it sounds like it is. We made this mistake since I never read the fine print (which isn't easy on a smart phone, but...). The hourly pass charges $4 an hour, and the clock stops running when you check the bike back into a rack. When you want to ride again you pick up another bike anywhere and the meter starts running again. It's set up so you can shop, have lunch or just relax and only be charged for your actual riding time.Once we figured out that we had the wrong plan (my wife does read the fine print ;-), we went to the Citi kiosk at the south end of Central Park, where we met Tammy, a Citi Bike representative. She was awesome!! She explained the different passes, and told us why the hourly pass was what we needed. She called customer service and got our day pass refunded (minus a charge for the overtime we had run up) and got us set up with the hourly pass. She also told us a lot of great places to ride, gave us a map of the city and the Citi Bike locations, and told us about the NYC CitiStreets festival scheduled for the next day. We wound up staying overnight, renting a bike the next morning and riding down Park Ave (closed to traffic that day) and over the Brooklyn Bridge. Tammy helped me have on of my best birthdays ever- my wife and I can't say enough good things about her. She rocks, and she made us Citibike fans forever."
mindp2016,"Norwalk, Iowa",1,08/08/2017,Don't rent bikes!! ,"DO NOT RENT: Very very disappointed in this service. They put hold of $104 on what ever card you use. I rented 2 bikes so that was basically $210 from my account that was frozen. This caused a HUGE problem since I have a daily limit, which doesn't work so good when I'm on vacation in NY. The deposit info isn't listed clearly on the rental stand. Once customer service was notified, they said we needed to read the waiver all 50 pages of it, despite a line of 5 people behind my group. The first CSR hung up on me after asking to speak to a manager. The 2nd CSR was so rude! I recommend renting a bike from 1 of the other vendors. The worst part of my vacation. NY was an incredible vacation for me and my friends. Sadly, this caused all 6 of us stress! "
Urvi C,,1,08/07/2017,Got charged ~100$ overtime fees on a daily pass!!!! :(,"I got a Citibike on Sunday. Since this was my first time ever using one, I called a customer care from bike stand. I mentioned to her that I have never used this service before and was in a rush. I asked her about the plans they offer and if I can take the bike on hourly basis. She mentioned that they only have 1 day, 3 days, monthly and annual plans. Since I needed the bike only for few hours, I went with a daily pass. The customer care representative asked me to spot a kiosk nearby to complete the transaction. What she ignored telling me is that the bike needs to be docked every 30 minutes to a bike stand to avoid a late fee. On returning the bike, I saw a humungous charge on my credit card of 100+. On calling customer care multiple times, every time I was told curtly that 'you need to plan your trip accordingly, '12$ is for system use', 'there is nothing we can do' etc. They adjusted the charge nominally on requesting a first-time courtesy but did not do it completely.This bike service is a complete scam and rip off. The customer agents are rude and this company is in business of making money based on customer's ignorance. With the amount of money they charged me, I could have bought an actual bike and used it forever! I want to question the rationale for this policy. If this is for bike sharing, the customers should be charged overtime only when the bikes there are less bikes available at the stand (similar to demand based pricing of Uber). The whole bike stand where I took the bike from was full! It pains to know that a large bank like Citi is sponsoring such an unethical company bike company! It seems both are not able to earn money by fair and regular business and adopting to such practices. Are consumer agencies listening to customer's plights and can this unfair policy be changed?Why am I being subject to something I was not aware of? Something that the customer care did not care to explain to me completely? I could have opted not to ride the bike that day. How does the charge of $ 100+ plus taxes justify using the bike for few hours in addition to paying a daily rate of $12 plus taxes and being liable for 1200$ for a lost or stolen bike? The company needs to train the customer service agents to give complete information and change the unfair overtime fees policy.I am simply not prepared and ‘cannot afford’ to pay 112$ as a bike rental for a day. I am sure others like you value your hard-earned money as well."
dmck64,"Ballarat, Australia",1,08/04/2017,Appalling customer service,"My advice is 'don't do it'. Hire bikes for half a day rather than being ripped off by this lot. Hidden conditions, expensive fines and poor quality equipment is just the beginning of it. I raised my concerns over the course of four or five emails and they refuse to reply to them. Pathetic! Be careful people!!!!!"
cpeoplesii,"Charlotte, North Carolina",1,08/01/2017,I got ripped off by Citi.  Do we have any lawyers out there that will take a class action?,"Citi once again has a hidden message in all the mumbo jumbo consent agreement where they can charge additional prices.  They mislead you to think you can rent and ride for 24 hours, but you can't."
sjeanhicks,"Cincinnati, Ohio",4,07/31/2017,24 Hour pass,"My husband and I rented these on our second day in NYC. The first day we rented from a different company and rode through the park, not even realizing that citi bike was an option. We purchased the 24 pass which was around $10 per person. We then rode from Times Square all the way to Pier A and back.Downside is that you can only have the bikes out to 1/2 hour at a time. Since we were going a long distance, we had to make an effort to stop 30 mins in and find a station. Which was fine, except for the times that we came to a station that didn't have any openings to dock the bikes.Overall, it was a good experience and I would do it again. Just make sure you are reading the fine print and know all the details before you buy."
Exeverywhere,"Lansdale, Pennsylvania",4,07/30/2017,Citi bikes were a great option,"We have been to NY many times but this was the first time we used the bikes. It really worked well for us when we wanted to cover a lot of ground relatively quickly. Also just pleasant in and of itself, especially when you stick to designated paths. The day pass made the whole experience both impulsive and leisurely. A real hop on and hop off experience. Though do be sure to dock within 30 minutes each time. But with docking stations seemingly everywhere they are easy to find, especially if you have a smartphone. The main caution is to check your bike before you pull it out of the dock. Most bikes were ok but check the tires, the bell (bell is quite important, you will use it as you are in either vehicle or pedestrian traffic all the time), the gear shift. I had a couple of duds before I wised up. Go for it!"
Michael K,,5,07/26/2017,Hourly pass in action,"Citi Bike is by far the best way to get around this concrete jungle, especially now that there's an hourly pass. This is perhaps the best kept secret in all of New York City. It's just $6 an hour, as many hours as you like, no overage. It's really top notch, and I must take my helmet off to Citi Bike for being so responsive to the needs of their customers.If I could pick 3 things to do on a visit to NYC, they'd be #1, bike around using a Citi Bike; #2 go to the Gibson in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and enjoy their namesake cocktail, the Tecate; and #3 eat pizza all the time."
Mnmom2009,"Mankato, Minnesota",3,07/24/2017,Only good for 30 minute intervals,"As a family we wanted to jump on a bike and ride a quick loop around Central Park. The bikes are located right at the Central Park South Entrance. Pop in your credit card- (never use a debit for rentals) and off you go. We thought we could make one loop around the park but with other bikers, walkers, skaters, poor signage we were only able to make it a little over half way before we noticed another citi bike rack. We popped our bikes back in and planned on taking them back out for another 30 minutes. The problem is the person with the original credit card was ahead of us on the path so we couldn't obtain a new code to unlock the bikes again. We ended up walking the rest of the park that day which was fine since the park is so beautiful. Renting from private companies at the park entrance is expensive but worth it if you plan on riding the whole day. "
StephenB4351,,5,07/24/2017,CitiBike is a great way to explore the city,"CitiBike has done a great thing and added an hourly pass! 6 bucks an hour, no security deposit or overages... A really nice addition to their other options especially for tourists or out of towners looking to explore the city. I used to live in New York so an annual pass made sense, but as a visitor from the West Coast now it's nice to have these other options."
Zachary K,"Brooklyn, New York",5,07/24/2017,New hourly passes are an amazing way to explore the city!,"I just had an amazing weekend exploring and cruising around NYC on a CitiBike. I rented the bike in the Central Park area, rode down to SoHo past all kinds of cool shops, and then travelled all the way over the bridge to Williamsburg! It took a while, sure, but that wasn't really a problem with the hourly pass. It was $6 bucks an hour and automatically charged me the correct amount when I was done. Riding over the Williamsburg bridge was AMAZING! Oh my goodness those views.Highly recommend CitiBike (and the hourly pass if you feel like traveling without a schedule) for doing some serious exploring of NYC."
Shari M,"New York City, New York",5,07/24/2017,awesome hourly bike rental,"you can rent these for $6 an hour which is awesome for those of us, local or not, that don't have a membership. yay citibike"
Wills H,"Brooklyn, New York",5,07/24/2017,hourly pass is $$$,Citibike released an hourly pass. exactly what i needed.  nice to have more than 30 minutes now before needing to doc a bike!
CAK1984,"New York City, New York",5,07/24/2017,Life changing!,"I love Citi bike and have been using it to commute from work to my daughter's daycare pretty much everyday. I used to use the hourly pass but I use the bikes so much that I recently got an annual membership. I'm not sure what the other reviews are talking about regarding the trip duration. You can buy the hourly pass for $6/hour and use it for as long as you want. I always recommend friends who are visiting the city to explore using a citi bike. Tourists- trust me, there's no scam, you just have to select hourly pass! I love that I can get a workout, save money and do something good for the environment. The app is also so helpful bc you can look at the dock nearest you and see how many bikes are available. I wish every city had citibike!!"
Lisa C,"Green Bay, Wisconsin",1,07/18/2017,SCAM!!!,"First of all if you are a tourist - use your credit card because on page 2 out of 50 is a tiny print preauthorization agreement that you agree to a $110 fee for 48 hours on your card. We used debit and have a limit on our card each day and it halted the use of my card. There are 6 in our group and each was charged that amount. So, Citi used our money for 48 hours totaling $660 for our group). ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! Then when we tried calling to get it off the customer service department was extremely rude (guessing they deal with lots of these calls) and hung up on us. To top it off we downloaded the app to make sure we didn't exceed the 30 min - and didn't matter because we did anyway. We started at the base of the Brooklyn bridge and ended across it in Brooklyn and we exceeded the 30 minutes. (if they know it is going to exceed it to cross, Citi should put a station on the top of the bridge). Along with it being shady, you have 24 hour access to the bikes, but have to dock them every 30 minutes. FINALLY to top it off, my bike was broke and would only go in third gear. If anyone goes in third gear uphill, it was virtually impossible!!!!! Dont waste your money and go with a local bike company!!!!!!!!!!"
Eisenwanderer,"Berlin, Germany",1,07/12/2017,Total Scam for Tourist - beware of late fines after 30 minutes!,"I see others experienced the same problem we had. I have rented bikes all over the world and I speak English! I saw the $12/day on the sign and said great. We biked from the top of central park to the Plaza where we saw some citibike employees. I wanted to ask them for directions and this guy said did you check your bike in? I said I just got my bike. He said you have to turn it in every 30 minutes and I said I rented it for the day. He said you have to check it in, I said that made no sense but went with him to check 3 bikes in only to see we were fined already $24! I was furious and told him I had never had such a thing happen with bike rental. HE THEN SAID WE ARE NOT A BIKE RENTAL! Oh ok - then what the heck are you? I said I am sure other tourists have the same problem and he said that is why they were there. He did not apologize or feel bad. I wrote citibike and got the same response about returning every 30 minutes. The concept is good but the random 30 minute time limit makes no sense. We saw locals even check their bikes in, sit on them for 2 minutes and then go again. As for the bikes themselves, most were in okay shape but if you are a tourist do you research and get a better bike that comes with a lock and let's you use as you wish."
MeghanONeill,"Invermere, Canada",3,07/11/2017,30 minutes is way too short,"We had an enjoyable experience on these bikes, however we found that the 30 minute deadline to dock your bike is far too short. They are a great way to explore a city, but after about 20 minutes, you're searching for the next station, which really impacted our experience. We met a couple that were unaware of this deadline, and had been riding for several hours. I have rented bikes in Paris and other cities in Europe before, no time limit, they work great. NYC needs to reconsider this 30 minute thing. Otherwise, the bikes were durable and solid and although we changed at 10 stations during the day, there was only one station that was full. It was an excellent alternative to walking for sure!"
Rick A,"Dallas, Texas",1,07/07/2017,NOT For Tourists,"I rented the bike because it told me that I had access for 24 hours. I rented it near Queensboro Bridge, so I assumed the bikes were there to travel and explore Queens. Long distance travel and enjoyment is what bikes are designed for. 5 hours later I found out from someone that I was supposed to return it within 30 minutes, which would never had occurred to me, because that totally defeats the purpose of renting a bike. This is just a way to scam ignorant tourists like myself. The bikes are for commuting to and from work, but not for tourists. They charged me $86. Even if I knew about the 30 minutes, it would be very difficult to impossible to try to rush around finding the next docking station, and not at all enjoyable. In 3rd gear, the bike will not even go that fast. All they would have to do is provide a pay by hour option, but instead they prefer to scam tourists. I could have rented by the hour and rented a much faster and enjoyable bike for less from another rental company."
Jason S,nyc,5,07/06/2017,Citi bike is awesome,Bike are very sturdy and dependable.  Great staff at the Valet stations too.  Ayianna and Tammy are the best!  Very helpful and super friendly!!
coloradomtngirl,"Denver, Colorado",1,07/04/2017,Tourist Trap,"We paid $105 for five bikes to cruise around Central Park for ninety minutes. Absolutely ridiculous! The fees seem reasonable—$12/bike for 30 minutes—but having to dock the bike every 30 minutes to avoid additional charges is inconvenient especially for tourists who have no idea where the bike stations are located (there are none in the park). Also, I was supposed to receive a text alert when I was nearing the 30-minute limit but never did. Surprisingly, they texted me when I docked the bikes. What a scam!"
vasd3f,"Portland, Oregon",5,07/03/2017,Perfect for short trips in addition to using public transit,"A lot of reviews seem to be upset about the 30-45 minute limit on ""free"" trips (when you buy a pass), but that's all stated upfront. If you want to bike around the whole day, or even a couple of hours non-stop, this isn't it. However, if you want to use the bike for 10-30 minute trips between destinations, this is much faster than walking and often faster than taking the bus. Just look up where to drop it off - they have docking stations every few blocks."
aussiemom3,"San Marcos, Texas",5,06/25/2017,So much fun!,"We were having difficulty with the 30 min check in and Tammy Evans, the valet, was super helpful!! We were able to bike a full lap around Central Park without too much difficulty! Super thankful for Tammy for making our trip so awesome!"
Sandra T,,1,06/24/2017,Feels like a SCAM,"WORST bike rental service I've ever used. I wish I could give me 0 to negative stars. If you don't want to have any overcharges given to you days after you even used a bike, DO NOT use this service. I did not even know about the 30min docking bike rule until I saw I was overcharged days later. It took us more than 20mins to even find another docking location, also not being from NYC worked against us. This ridiculous system seems to have been purposely created to scam people and force them to pay the fees. Day pass was $13 and for just riding over and hour without docking, we paid a total of $30+ each. Customer service is just as useless."
Graeme291,"Caithness and Sutherland, United Kingdom",2,06/18/2017,EXPENSIVE PEDAL,"My wife and I were on a 4 night stay in New York City and covered as many highlights as possible. I'm a keen cyclist and so we looked at quick cycling options for a half day or so. I weighed up various companies inc Citi Bike which have numerous stations around the city and tourist areas. This seemed a convenient option offering freedom to pick up and deposit wherever.As I realise now it was an expensive option. Stations advertise a bike hire at $12 dollars per day. Sounds good? So I thought. The next half hour is included in the initial charge of $12 then it gets expensive. Let's face it, if your hiring a bike then 30 minutes is nothing if your stopping here and there to take on views, photos etc.Thereafter the rates jump to $4 per 15 minutes X say two bikes, it becomes a pretty expensive hire.On hindsight, I'd go for another option/company like Blazing Saddles even though it reduces hire and return options it'll work out infinitely cheaper plus provision of that all important cycle helmet."
Elizabeth M,,1,06/16/2017,What a Rip Off!,"The sign when I rented my bike inferred I could borrow it for up to 24 hours hours for a flat $12 fee. That seemed pricey, given I only wanted to go a hour or so and other bike sharing systems cost $5 for the hour, but I went for it. What a mistake! Not only was I charged the $12 fee, but I was charged an additional $33 for using the bike for almost 2 hours (I was enjoying the ride). $45 expense. Never again."
Gerdt B,,1,06/15/2017,Don't use Citi Bike when you can ride a bike,"The most stupid system where you can bike for 20 minutes, look for a dockingstation to avoid a penalty. No service in the weekend, almost no serivice during the week.At the end of the day I had to pay over $ 200.- because I turned the bike in too late, I used it all day (according to them but why the previous penalties?) often empty dockingstations. Without wifi not doable to find a dockingstation.I wish I had this idea to earn money this easy.Conclusion: buying a bike is cheaper or rent one for one day without this stupid 30 minutes rule. Plenty to find"
Leo M,,1,06/14/2017,Citi bike is an expensive way of cycling in NYC,When you buy a day pass you still have to return your bike every 30 min. which is rediculous ! A day pass should provide access for the whole day not 30 min. This limitation was not obvious so cycling with 2 bikes in NYC for 6 hours was very expensive !! The Citi bike system is misleading & very costly.Go to a regular bike shop if you want to rent a bike in NYC !!!
Daniel E,"Gainesville, Florida",4,05/31/2017,Convenient service. Maybe better for residents than tourists.,"I got a day pass and used it from about noon to 11 at night. I was able to find bike stations all over Manhattan and in Downtown Brooklyn, which made it really convenient. The downsides are: the text messages could be more helpful, like telling you when your bikes were checked out instead of when they were docked, the bikes are good but not great, and sometimes you really want to ride from the financial district to the AMNH, but that's too far for the 30 minute time limit. Definitely would recommend and would reuse on future visits."
DavidAdvis0,"Enschede, The Netherlands",5,05/28/2017,One of the best biking experiences ever,"I have travelled to many cities with bike sharing scheme, but this was the best. The quality of the bikes, availability ...Only the 30 min limitation seems a bit stringent because the city is big... and if you don't have the app, it is not so efficient. Anyway, please do it !(I didn't have a bike even)! But the streets are increasingly safer and drivers were very kind."
Douglas P,"Brasilia, DF",5,05/24/2017,"Good system, undeserved bad flack","Great system specially to move around in New York (Brooklyn even more so). I used it to take a long ride in Central Park and it was really nice, although because of the 30 min limit I'd recommend a bike rental (walk around the park and you'll see lots of guys holding 'bike rental' signs). It wasn't super stressful, but I had to keep track of time constantly so I wouldn't exceed the 30 min limit and pay extra (you pay $12 for 24h and $24 for 72 hours). After you dock it, you must wait 2 min in order to be able to pick another one up, which is reasonable, imo.I saw someone criticize that they charged her for not docking her bike properly, and I think she can't complain - I mean, it's not rocket science, you just check that a green light comes up and confirms the correct docking. Otherwise anyone can come and just take the bike away. Someone else said they couldn't find a bike in one of the docking stations. That happens everywhere in any city that has such a system. The app shows you which stations have more units available, so it's​ not really that difficult to plan ahead."
380hanschristiant,"Hillerod, Denmark",3,05/21/2017,Good intentions,"We bought a one day pass to bike around NYC, there is definitely some good intentions with this idea, but also some annoying issues like, the app not always working, preventing you from getting a bike, only 30 min ride unless you want to pay additional 4$/15 min which is a bit stressful as you always needs to plan the drop off and keep track of the clock. Errors with the bikes and the docks also caused some issues, as if you take out a bike and find out it is broken, you can place it back in the dock but are not allowed to take another bike until you have waited some minutes 3-5, even though you marked it as defect. To improve they should work on the app to solve the instability, to allow one to immediately pull a new bike if it is broken, and allow for more than 30 min ride and or lower the prize for riding outside the included 30 min.If we were to do this again, I would recommend to rent a bike another place where you have it a full day with a lock so you can bike around in your own tempo."
hegneo,"New York City, New York",1,05/16/2017,Horrible !,It was my first time to use Citi bike and it was horrible. I rent two bikes one for me and other for my husband. We took the bike around and wanted to return. Of course they location where we got it from did not have any space so we had to ride farther away. We docked the bike went home. We leave pretty far away like every one knows there is no citi bike up town. We got home and I got messages that I get extra charged for time. I decide to give them a call. They told me one of the bikes is not docked in. I was confused case there was one code to take the bikes and there have to be TWO messages when you dock the bike. The costumer service told me to go back and dock the bike. I have young kids and I was not able to go back. Apparently they can not do anything to help you with just have extra charges.SO PLEASE WHEN YOU EVER TAKE CITI BIKE READ ALL THE RULES EVEN THERE IS LINE OF PEOPLE WHO GETS UPSET WHEN YOH TAKE LONG TIME. Just do it will save you lot of money !!!' Never again 
Larry L,"New York City, New York",5,05/13/2017,Best Experience in NYC,"If you haven't been on a bike in a big city, this seems like a scary thing to do. It's actually amazingly tranquil. Traffic in NYC moves at 5-15 MPH, making bikes the fastest way to get around and neutralizing the danger of fast moving vehicles. "
TrippyTripDip,,5,05/13/2017,Fantastic way to get around the city,"I love using Citi bike to get around NYC. I've lived here for two years and the coverage has become amazing. During peak rush hour, it can be a little tough to find a bike at a dock, but usually I never have issues with Citi Bike. Definitely a great way for tourists to get around the city too."
Jennifer M,"Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin",5,05/10/2017,Best Way to See NYC!!!,"My husband and I just got back from a 4-day weekend in NYC. It was our first time there and other than a list of some things we wanted to see, we had absolutely no plans. As soon as we got into Manhattan, my husband spotted these bike racks and after looking into it a bit, we signed up for the 3-day pass for 2 bikes ($48+ tax). My husband is NOT a city guy, but he just keeps talking about how awesome it was having the bikes. We ended up seeing more attractions than we had ever planned partly because it was so easy to get around and partly because as we were biking, we came across places we wouldn't have even thought of! The only downfall of the entire thing was that you could only have a bike for a max of 30 minutes, which in reality makes sense, it was just a bit annoying when we wanted to ride a long distance. This was such an awesome, unexpected part of our vacation, it was invaluable!"
brunomili1,"Sao Paulo, SP",1,05/03/2017,I do not recommend! System charged me much more than what was proposed!,"I do not recommend it because the system is meant to mislead the customer. You need to keep returning the bike every 30 minutes, which makes it difficult to use and disrupts the ride dynamics. And due to an error when I returned the bike because it did not fit properly at the station, an extra charge of USD 100.00 was charged to my credit card, without any warning, that is unacceptable! Besides the bicycles are poorly maintained, for example in my case where the bicycle seat was totally loose due to the clip being broken!"

RoryB424,,5,04/25/2017,AMAZING addition to NYC,"Can't say enough good things about the Citi Bike program. I have been a very active user since the summer of 2013. I first came most in handy when I first began dating my GF and I lived far west in midtown and she in the WV. The bikes made it SO easy to get to her in the evening/weekends. Then I have used it for errands, meeting friends, to get to work, to the subways, to events.... Its amazing and worth every penny spent. 150 of the year and you will save on car fares, time, subway rides and you will see more of the city while excising. Enjoy!"
AndrewBritt,"Sydney, Australia",1,04/21/2017,Great Idea... But terrible time restrictions,"We rented 2 bikes at $12 for 24 hours.. No where did it clearly explain the 30 minute restriction. When it says $12, 24 hours and unlimited in the same sentence you expect to pay $12 for as many rides as you'd like within a 24 hour period.. I think it would be a struggle to get between some of the bike docking areas in under 30mins..We had a great time riding the Hudson and East rivers, but I only realised the issue when I just checked my credit card statement and saw an extra charge for $26.13 for a date after I'd left NY.This is really a tourist con and should be avoided.. Taking the Underground or Uber would have been a much cheaper option just less interesting.."
Norma June C,,5,04/21/2017,Best way to explore NYC!,Coming from Maine the weather was beautiful. Saw the multitude of city bikes around and had to try them. Left the west village and grabbed a couple on the awesome pedestrian path on the west side highway. Biked to battery park and back in less than an hour among other places. What a view! PLENTY of bikes on the bike path away from interior where they are needed more. A must do when in the city!
robkmurf,"Cork, Ireland",3,04/17/2017,Bike ride in Central Park.,"We decided to have a bike ride through Central Park so we used citi bike rental. It was a great price for what you get, So we went into Central Park. The bikes were very heavy. When we were going up a hill the bike made you break a sweat, But it was a great price for what you got."
pschangs,"Alexandria, Virginia",3,04/12/2017,Read the Fine Print,"I enjoyed that my friend and I were able to rent bikes for only $16, but that $16 was accompanied by several inconveniences.First, they charge a $101 hold. In order to receive the hold back, I had to call my bank twice. We rode the bikes on Saturday, and I didn't get my hold back until the next Friday. This was tough for me, as I put myself on a strict budget when I travel.Secondly, you pay $12 for unlimited 30-minute rides--NO riding for uninterrupted spans of time! If you want to bike for longer than 30 minutes, you need to find another docking bay within the 30 minute span of time, dock the bike, then request another ride. This can get tricky. My friend and I were extremely cognizant of time and still got charged $4 for returning bikes a couple minutes late.If you want a means of transportation to get from Point A to Point B, then Citi Bike will provide that; HOWEVER, if you want a leisurely bike ride around Central Park or along the Hudson, I don't recommend Citi Bike. The stress of timing myself and finding docking bays to avoid additional fees took away from what should have been an easygoing bike ride."
HighHorse,"Melbourne, Australia",4,03/08/2017,"Easy to find, easy to use, easy to ride","Used them to navigate our way through Central Park.

KCups,"Pennsylvania Dutch Country, Pennsylvania",2,03/01/2017,Central park NYC bike ride,"I rented 4 bikes to go around central park. We were aware of the 30min limit for the day pass but what I did not realize was that the time stamp started when you purchase and not when you get the bike codes. My credit card was charged the extra $35 because we exceeded by 4 minutes on the 1st ride and 1 minute on the second ride. Also, it seemed like they counted the overage based on when the last bike was docked because I subscribed to the txt alerts and I have the message showing 2 bikes were docked in time, but the 2 other bikes were a minute late. The bikes are really good for riding around central park, just return them all after about 20mins of riding to be safe."
candacexanne,Toronto,5,02/26/2017,Best way to get around.,"We loved renting the City Bikes to get around. It was so much fun with our group, cheaper than a taxi, faster than the train and it gave us the flexibility to move around more often. We bought a day pass, which was great for docking and re picking up. The con's of this would be, sometimes there aren't any nearby bikes, and you can only have the bike out for 30 mins at a time. Trust me, i got charged extra time."
Helen M,"Westchester County, New York",4,02/24/2017,"great way to see NY City, especially on a sunny day","day rental was very easy. plenty of stations. display screens at stations are very helpful for looking at bike routes, finding other bike stations (with bikes and spaces available). Loved the bike routes - easy to get around from 29th street to Greenwich Village to lovely ride back up the East River. Bikes are heavy - but the gearing is simple and smooth, as is riding the bike. I had trouble with the phone app. I could not see a map - which made it hard to find a station, but I could see a list of nearby stations - so with some juggling I was able to navigate. For the most part drivers were very careful and stayed out of bike lanes. Couple of double-parked cars, and taxi drop-offs, and delivery vehicles were in the lane(s). I took my own helmet - I highly recommend wearing a helmet."
Nolinice,,5,02/20/2017,Faster than a speeding bullet,"Given the dismal choices of moving around the big apple (stuck in traffic or shacking on a subway train underground?) being able to ride outside and see the neighbourhoods is an amazing alternative when the weather is nice. With a one day pass we got our touring and our exercise, dropping the bikes every 30 min at a different station. The amount of stations is pretty overwhelming and is almost impossible not to find one nearby, but sometimes they might be fully occupied with no empty dock to return the bike to.so get and use the app that gives you location, availability and allows you to generate codes and unlock bikes where you need them, in addition to keeping track of time, help generating best course and identify stations. We felt quite safe on the cycling lanes . Only surprise the 101 $ deposit charged, visible in the fine prints but not highlighted during the purchase process."
MaryEllen222,"Easton, Pennsylvania",4,02/20/2017,"bikes were good, instructions left something to be desired","This was my first experience using citi bike. I'd read up online but did not create an account or use the app. I used my credit card to rent 3 bikes - that was pretty easy. It took a minute to figure out where to put the code in, but we were good to go. Having purchased a full day of unlimited 30 minute trips, I set the timer on my phone for 20 minutes & we ventured into Central Park. After we docked our bikes for the first 30 minute session, it took a while to figure out that we needed to get new codes. when I went to get a new code, instead of getting one code good for 3 bikes, which is what I had the first time, I got a code good for one bike. back to the machine. Got a second code good for one bike. then I learned that you have to wait two minutes between getting codes. which means, at best, bike one will ""expire"" 6 minutes before bike three. what the heck is that all about? That was pretty frustrating to say the least. I still see the $303 hold on my credit card, but its only been 24 hours so I will keep an eye on it.Pros: fun way to explore an area without having to lug your own bikegreat way to get from spot to spot if you are enjoying a touristy or casual daycons: not great if you plan on a leisurely ride unless you are willing to pay $4 for every 15 minutes after the check in. While there are lots of check ins around New York city, they are not inside Central park - so we could not, for example, ride around, check in the bikes & walk right into the zoo or the skating rink. you'd have to park them out on the street somewhere and then walk back in. I would do this again if I wanted to cover a good distance without being in a car or a train. but its not cheaper than a taxi across town if you are more than one person.I would not do this again to bike in Central Park - I'd probably rent from one of the many other people there who don't require a 30 minute check in."

As convenient as a subway might be, it doesn't allow you all of the above...The system is very easy to handle- just download the app (Make sure you have an internet connection), and plan your trips through the city!"
DanielSmithh95,"Bury, United Kingdom",5,01/07/2017,My favourite thing to do while in NY ,"I can honestly say this is the best thing we did while in New York! We hired the bikes to cycle through Central Park, for $12 you get 24 hours unlimited use, however make sure you return the bikes every 30 mins, otherwise you get charge an additional $4 per 15 mins. There are lots of docking stations so you will be fine! Can not recommend this enough! "
C145WDjamesd,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",4,01/04/2017,Same system as London ,"It's a great system! Rent for 24hours and return every 30mins (easy to do with the app). Never have any issues and it's lots of fun. 

In the U.K. it is £2 for 24 hours rather than $12+tax mind!"
AndersOdense,Odense,5,12/31/2016,Easy and fun ,"The service is really easy, the bikes are in very good quality. 
We found I best to use the streets with less traffic. Central Park is a must. 
This was one of the best things we experienced in New York."
SimonC14SRD,"Camberley, United Kingdom",5,12/08/2016,"Brilliant , brilliant, brilliant ","Citibikes are a must, we used them everyday (simply download the app, pay for 3 day pass and off you go). Brooklyn bridge, Brooklyn heights, all across manhattan. There are lots of dedicated cycle lanes which make it safe and bike stops everywhere. Be careful not to go over 30 minutes each time as you get charged. Enables you to see the sights and get fit too!! A MUST, TRUST ME "
dmcwyo,wyoming,5,11/27/2016,Ride Citi bike in NYC,Do not pass up riding the Citi bikes in NYC It is great way to get around and great way to see the city. Use the app to find Bikes and docks to park them . Do not be afraid of riding them . People are very courteous to bikers and the bike lanes are great.
Callie F,"New York City, New York",5,11/17/2016,Life changing,get places quick. membership is cheap. bikes have lights and bells. heavy structure allows higher calorie burn. stations are everywhere. they need to add more up uptown but in bk and Manhattan they're so convenient. never have to worry about your bike getting stolen. maintenance is provided by Citibank so no flat tires. I love citibike
Robert M,brooklyn,4,11/16/2016,Convenient and quick,"CitiBike seems to be the most efficient way to get around in Manhattan. As one who finds myself often pressed for time, CitiBike has kept me from arriving late for appointments on many occasions."
mikesherman1957,"Hong Kong, China",5,11/10/2016,The best,Way around Nyc.  A beautiful fall day a great ride and got me where I needed to be when I needed to be there
Zak83c,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",4,11/09/2016,Well worth doing. Need more gears though!,I'd definitely recommend giving these a go though I've not tried any similar bike rentals for comparison. The cost is pretty fair though the docking every 30 minutes does feel a bit like a money making scheme. I found there to be plenty of bikes and stations available and they're easy to ride and adjust however it would nice to have a few more gears for tackling hills etc.
adi_pundak_mintz,"Tel Aviv, Israel",4,11/07/2016,"Great, but...","Very helpful service
It will improve 
Not enough stations.
During busy hours too many stops are empty or full.
Bikes work well compared to imitate services in other cities.
On boarding is easy"
temp0rary,"New York City, New York",5,11/03/2016,Essential part of NYC,"I love Citi Bike, I need Citi Bike, New York City definitely needs Citi Bike. I don't own my own bike and use Citi Bike to get almost everywhere I go in the city. Extremely convenient, safe, reliable, and a good work out!I hope they will continue expanding to East Williamsburg and Bushwick. Their bikes have consistently been in good condition lately, I think a testament to good service and maintenance. They also transport bikes around to fill up empty stations and empty out full stations. Their app used to be glitchy which I haven't used in a long time, but they may have fixed that already."
Todd F,,5,11/01/2016,An excellent way to get around NYC,Citibike is an excellent way to get around NYC and a great way to see the city. I use a citibike for errands around the city or just to get a little excersize traveling from point A to B. Great for locals or tourists!
JJ315,New York,4,11/01/2016,Great addition to life in NYC,"This program is still in its early days, but even with a few kinks, it works rather well. There is a bit of a learning curve with using the hardware and software. I have been using it several times a month. I have an annual membership so I have had the chance to use my learnings. I see the tourists struggling a bit though, especially if they don't have the app to help locate available bikes and docking stations."
charliebeyer,"Rumson, New Jersey",5,11/01/2016,Love the flexibility ,Have used Citi Bike since they were introduced and they have gotten better every year. The. Ike's are better. The locations are more and more. The city has made more bike lanes. Over all better. There still are times when there are not bikes or docks where I need them. But with a minute of planning before a trip I get adjusted. It's not perfect but it's great. Wear a helmet even if you have to buy one before or during a ride. 
sinkyourteeth,"New York City, New York",5,11/01/2016,For New Yorkers and bike-friendly tourists,"I love Citi Bike. I use it several times a week in my home neighborhood in Park Slope (Brooklyn) and during the workday in Manhattan. It's ideal for short, one-way trips when you live in New York City. Tourists beware - unless you're comfortable biking in a city and/or familiar with a bikeshare program, it may not be what you expect. Citibike is NOT designed for a leisurely afternoon of sightseeing, and you're limited to using the bikes for 30 minutes at a time. You can use it to get from Chelsea Market down to the West Village. (Stop, walk around, get a bite, then get another bike (unlimited trips per day) and head to a different neighborhood.) But if you're looking to ride around in Central Park, you'd be better off renting a bike for 2 or more hours from one of the bike rental places in or around Central Park."
Brian R,Maryland,5,10/24/2016,Only Way To Travel,"Biking in New York City may seem suicidal, but it's actually the ideal way to explore the city - and fairly safe. The phone app is user friendly.The Greenway lets you cycle around the entire island, mostly along the rivers. The parts we biked were traffic free except where you had to cross streets.We also biked up and down busy avenues on specially-marked green bike lanes which often had barriers separating bikers from traffic. Other streets had bike lanes but many of these were somewhat lethal with all the double-parked cars to go around.We did the $12-a-day deal which is inexpensive with a caveat - you have to get a new bike every 30 minutes. This worked OK except for a long stretch on the Greenway along the lower East Side where we didn't see a bike station. It's an extra $4 for every 15 minutes over 30 minutes.The bikes were mostly in decent condition with 3 gears, lights in front and back and a small rack in front to carry stuff.Next time we're in NYC we plan to bike around the entire island - 30 minutes at a time."
MauiMaluhia,"Wailuku, Hawaii",4,10/22/2016,Great way to get around New York,"What a great way to see Manhattan on a beautiful day. Well designed concept, decent bikes, and a helpful app helps you find locations and even has a gauge to tell you how many bikes are there. You can't have an individual bike rented over 30 minutes, so sometimes you have to return it and grab another to avoid extra charges. When you return your bike, you have to push it into the bike holder really hard!Fun experience!"
YachtZephyr,"Red Hook, St. Thomas",5,10/22/2016,CaptDon,I thought this was a great way to get around. Bikes were all I good working order. Easy to find bikes and drop in different locations.
JohanN1585,,1,10/19/2016,Stupid system,"The system sucks, you gotta put the bicycle back every 30 minutes or it will be extremely expensive. This company could could learn a lot from copenhagen or berlin. RENT YOUR BIKE ANOTHER PLACE"
mattrobertsau,"Melbourne, Australia",5,10/18/2016,Get around the City on a bike,"I hired a Citi Bike for the first time for the day and rode down the Hudson River to Battery Park. Then later in the day went to Central Park and rode around there which was a really nice experience. Just remember to watch the clock, as when you haven't docked in 30 minutes you get charged!"
Louisalivingston,"New York City, New York",4,10/13/2016,Easy to Rent a Bike in New York City,"Whether you're away from home or live in NYC, it's easy to rent a bike. You'll see stands of them in many parts of NYC. Each place has a large sign displaying Manhattan and directions about paying for the bike. Some of the streets you may ride have a specific bike lane; unfortunately, though, many streets do not, so that can make it kind of scary to ride a bike."
holakritty,"Cartagena, Colombia",5,10/11/2016,Best way to get around,"I love love love citibike NYC. They should make me an ambassador. I opted for a 3 day pass and found quite often citibike was the fastest way to move around Manhattan, beating uber, taxi, bus and met/subway. You get to see more than if you are simply stuck underground on the subway. You burn calories so you can eat more delicious food. If you use it as often as I did, it's also amazing value. Granted I was visiting New York during pleasant weather so this might be a contributing factor to my enjoyment. Also when I visited Harlem, there were almost no citibike stands. But everywhere else I went the bikes were plentiful and convenient and the citibike app showing location and availability was super easy to use."
kylelopez87,"San Diego, California",5,09/18/2016,Great,Citi bike was a great way to get around the city. Super efficient and you really feel like your a local. Give it a try next time in New York
Davec796,"Macclesfield, United Kingdom",1,09/16/2016,rip off,"these bike rents are a total waste of time. and they will cost you a lot more than what you bargain for. we rented to use around the park, we spent most of the time riding to the next station, which were out of the parks and not that easy to find. half an hour to get to the next station, its a joke! or you get charged, we were charged double the rent as finding the station were not easy, and some were just full! do not rent these bikes"
amazeballs293,S��͏D,4,09/16/2016,Great way to get around NYC,"I really enjoyed using a bike as a means of transportation. Citi bike has convenient locations throughout the city. If you're going to rent for a whole day I recommend you plan your trip according to docking stations. You must dock your bike in 30 minute intervals, failing to do so will result in a fee. So if you plan on being on the bike for more than 30 minutes you should definitely plan to ride by a docking station just to dock and avoid the fee."
Stinez,"Livermore, California",4,09/15/2016,A Fun Way to See More,"We used their bikes to get to the normal tourist stuff (buildings, bridges, parks, etc.) but the highlight of these bikes was the ability to wonder around some of the very cool neighborhoods of NY. And with that I feel that we got to see bits and pieces of the city that you simply can't see or experience without the freedom a bike offers. (We normally rent scooters when we travel and this was the next best thing) However I would caution folks that it's a bit dangerous out there (cars, pedestrians, potholes, etc) so it may not be for everyone. "
Jake G,"New York, New York, United States",5,09/06/2016,The best way to get around NYC,"Easy, affordable, fun... and you get to see the sights. Every tourist has to try the subway and a yellow cab, but this is the best choice for most short trips - especially across town!"
KKMurphymom,"Kingsport, Tennessee",1,09/06/2016,"Great idea, poor execution ","I had a wonderful weekend in NYC and fortunately this was my only negative experience. Earl C review below details it perfectly. You have to check the bikes in every 30 minutes ( not near enough time) and when you find a station they are all full. I thought I was spending 26 dollars only to find out I ended up getting charged 50. Thank goodness I gave up or I would've gone broke. This really makes me mad because I enjoyed the rest of NYC so much. Whatever you do, DO NOT RENT THESE. To make matters worse, when I cAlled and tried to explain that all the stations were full and I could not check mine in, the customer service was HORRID. She refused to take off the extra charges. Lesson learned! "
IamWalker,"Bengaluru, India",5,09/04/2016,Convenient mobility,"Easy to access bike stations. 3 gear bikes makes it very easy to pedal around. Adjustable seat height makes it easy to ride. I did a lot of point-to-point rides in Manhattan. The bike lanes and city nav on the mobile made travel a breeze. Appreciated the little carrier ahead of the handle bar. All in all a green ride, hassle free, soaked up the city scenes as I road."
Earl C,,4,09/03/2016,Biiking through Central Park!!,"My wife and I enjoyed renting and riding bikes from Citibikes in New York. The process was relatively easy, and the bikes were clean and in pretty good shape. The baskets on the front were definitely a positive and easy to use. Unfortunately, you have to check in every 30 minutes to avoid extra charges. This is what prevented me from giving them 5 stars. This is a major inconvenience especially since Central Park is so huge!! They should have trackers in the bikes if they are concerned with them being stolen, and they should give you at least an hour or more before having to check it in between rides if you rent it for the entire 24 hour, or daily rate. You need at least an hour of cardio on a bike for it to be advantageous, and you don't want to have to worry about where the nearest check in station is, until after that hour is over.Try to fix that, and you will have more users.Thanks.EC."
H E,"Ottawa, Canada",5,09/03/2016,A different view to NYC,"We really enjoyed using Citi Bike. we rented it for 24 hrs. It gave us a whole different view of NYC. We started near Wall Street. we took the west side path along the water. It was really great. We had no issue with the 30 minutes limit. There were already several station along the bike path. We just choose the stations with high inventory just in case. Keep in mind that you will need to leave the bike for 2 minutes after every 30 minutes. In our case, we needed to rest since it was a very hot day. Also, please keep in mind that it you would like to get another code, for whatever reason, you will need to wait 5 minutes for the old code to expire.Another tip, make sure that your bike is in a good shape before entering the code specially the seats. Some of the seats don't stay in place even after being tightened.The iPhone app is great."
Joannie707,"London, United Kingdom",5,09/02/2016,A great way to see NYC,The Citi bike system is the same as the bike hire system in London. You can have as many 30 minute rides as you want in 24 hours for around $14 but if you go over 30 minutes on any of the rides you will be charged extra. As long as you make sure you know the location of the docking stations and use an app to check spaces and bike availability you will find it great. It is the perfect way to get around New York but try and keep to bike lanes. We cycled up to the bike route that runs all along the Hudson. It's a great day out if the weather is good. You can also go across to Brooklyn and dock and pick up bikes there. Just keep an eye on the time to get the best value.
TeyG86,"Gold Coast, Australia",5,09/01/2016,A NYC Must Do!,"What a great way to get around NYC!So much fun, comfortable to ride and easy to get used to (as long as you find one way streets, preferably with bike lanes) Cars are pretty good at navigating around you... as are pedestrians. Used by many NY locals with annual passes.Tip- even if you are only using for a few days, you may be better off paying for monthly pass rather than the $12ea p/day.Now the negatives... Be sure to dock your bike correctly (when you see a green light) Otherwise you'll find yourself in a panicked Taxi ride back to its location hoping you aren't going to be charged $1200 for a lost bike. Some docks are busted.Also: using the website that shows you docking stations and bike availability is not always updated and we would get there to find it completely empty!Last small negative... they dont have baskets or bottle holders. Just a gap at front with a rope so have a suitable size bag or bumbag/ fanny pack you can hold your belongings in."
Tramble  T. T,"Philadelphia, United States",4,08/31/2016,Bike rental in NYC,The change to a 24 hour rental from last year's system of having a half hour rental is discouraging for out-of-town renters.
Varun J,,5,08/28/2016,"Very convinient, best way to explore the city","You can find the citi bike stand almost anywhere in Manhattan and are really worth the price. There are dedicated lanes for cycles in most of the avenues and if you are even decent at cycling, then this is the way to explore the city"
Hanne1178,"Oslo, Norway",5,08/26/2016,New York by bike,"We are a couple, both 50. We spent a week in New York August-16. This time we chose Citi Bikes instead of taxi and the subway. It cost $12 for one day, or $24 for three days. We biked around in all district on Manhatten, and we took Williamsburg bridge to Brooklyn, and Brooklyn bridge back to Manhatten. This was great! You rent a bike for 30 min at a time. That is ok because there is also a station nearby. We just switched bikes when we needed a bike longer than 30 min. If you do not return the bike within 30 min, you will get a $8 pr 15 minutes.We downloaded an app with all the stations.The cardrivers in NY is used to bikers, and there are bike lanes in many streets. We felt safe.We highly recommend Citi Bikes! "
Crossonero9,"Milan, Italy",5,08/23/2016,Loved the experience,"I was completely against it but worked out well, easy to use kiosk and plenty of stations to return, rented on 33rd street and returned by museum in central park then used it to go back to times square. When you want to rent a new one just press the green button, insert credit card used, select number of bikes and you'll get a new code. You get confirmation that you return bikes once locked as well, worked well and great communication. It was crazy driving them around the city but they worked well and they were easy to use, I hadn't used a bike in like 10 years."
Bo Z,"New York City, New York",3,08/17/2016,I will go other bike renting if I options,The Citi overcharged me $34 except for the daily renting. I am still in the process of dispute. We will see.
robcurtross,"New York City, New York",3,08/16/2016,Variable,"I went to early adopter with a year long pass a few years ago, but I have moved to three day and seven-day passes depending on what my hiking and biking plans.The bikes could be great or could have technical problems and it's not easy to decide until you start riding. It's part of the adventure, of course.And, the app TD works pretty well.Just be prepared to hike or take the train or even a cab."
Christina J,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",4,08/16/2016,Best way to get around NYC,"I was staying with a friend in Brooklyn for the weekend and used the citibikes to get around. It worked perfectly and we did the whole of Manhattan as well as the Brooklyn side. Had to stop and change bikes every 30 min, since some of our rides were longer than that. Some stations were a bit temperamental and didn't always want to release the bikes the first go. I used 20 different bikes over the weekend and only one had problems with the gears. All the other were in good shape. Lots of stations everywhere and easy to find with the gps component in the station map. I would definitely use the citibikes next time I get back to NYC. I'm just hoping it won't be 110F again. "
jouk-7,manchester uk,4,08/14/2016,30 minutes as many times as you want in nyc for 24 hours,"good locations all over the city, but can be a little tricky getting to your next stop within the 30 minutes time limit unless you want to pay a bit extra happier to bike on paths than in traffic as a tourist but good way round the park and also round less crowded areas"
HeidiCapeTown,"Cape Town, South Africa",5,08/14/2016,The best way to move around in NY,"I bought a 3 day pass on the internet. Walked to the first station J saw. Chose a bike. Requested a code to undock and off I went! What a great way to explore NY. The traffic at times was very frustrating and scary to move through. I think one of the main problems currently is due to all the building of roads etc going on. One complaint only, the carrier in front is too small"
MrVisittheworld,,2,08/10/2016,"Bikes availibility limited, bikes in a bad technical condition","I am using the bike sharing system many times during a year since 2012. It is a great idea and much better for crusing from A to B than taxi or bus. Bikes availibility is not equal (anymore). At more and more stations, bike docks are empty with no bikes available. A lot of stations have bikes in a bad technical conditions, which cannot be used for riding. I found 6 outbof 10 bikes having some failures, which you can only detect when trying it."
manstondrive,"Bishops Stortford, United Kingdom",5,08/10/2016,Afternoon biking round Central Park,The $12 (plus tax) fee for 24 hours of bike use is a bargain. All you need to do is change your bike very 30 mins or you will get hit with a $5 fee for every 15 mins over. We rode some - had a break - picked up new bikes and rode again. What a great approach to bike use. All bikes used were in great condition with pumped up tyres 
davidrC2613JQ,,5,08/06/2016,Best way around Manhattan,"Quick review - this is the best way to get around Manhattan. Fast. Efficient. 

I've been here 20 times before and walked, subwayed, or cabbed. 

Grab a bike!  Faster. And way more fun."
woodie12,Melbourne,4,07/29/2016,Good value - once you get your head around the maps,I have used these in Washington DC so used this time in New York. You have 30 minutes included to get from one stop to the next. This can be stressful at times if you haven't clearly got your destination in mind. You must have a mobile phone to access the maps - essential! Riding in the bikes lanes in NYC was easy and there are lots of stops. Central Park was challenging as the roads for bikes are one way and there are no Citi Bikes in the northern area of the park. On the map there are stations that are coming - but I got confused and went to one and ended paying the penalty for being more than 30 minutes as it seemed to take ages to get back to the correct one.Ride along the waterfront of the river - there is lots to see and not a lot of traffic. But even riding around the streets of NYC you see so much more than you can on foot.Suggestion to Citibike: allow connecting a pay at machine to the app so that you can have an alert when the 30 min time is coming near.
DennisHallett,"West Chester, Pennsylvania",5,07/26/2016,Great way to get around,My family and I used the citi bikes the entire week we were in Manhattan. Rode from Wall St to Central Park and back. Rode over the Brooklyn bridge. This was super convenient and once you got used to returning every 30 minutes it wasn't bad. Would definitely recommend this and ride on the long bike path on the West Side.
71jaimes,"Issaquah, Washington",3,07/25/2016,See the city by bike,"It was our second day in New York City. We decided to meet with a friend who lived near by at Central Park. He mentioned that a great way to see the park was with a bicycle. As we made it through the hectic weekend subway routing at Columbus circle. We were quickly approached by several street bike vendors offering us deals. We denied them, mostly because we weren't sure what offer entailed and usually finding bad experience with handing people off the street any money value. We had seen Citi Bike kiosk across the town and thought it would be an easy go to location with plenty of locations scattered across the city. So the whole set up for renting a bike is very easy. Read the instructions, pop in your CC and out comes a code with a receipt. Be sure to add in your cell phone number because if it wasn't for that we would have had a costly bill. So we ordered a 24 hour day pass. For 2 bikes which came to $26.00 something after taxes ( $12.00 a bike ). We had planned to visit a few locations near Central Park and eat. I rate the experience average because of their tricky guidelines that some might not see. If it wasn't for us agreeing to the text message we would have not known that we would of accrued a high bill. The fine print states that you must check in the bike every 30 mins. Which means you have 30 mins to enjoy your bike before you must physically check in your bike at another kiosk. If you don't every 15 mins you will be charge $4.00 per bike. We randomly checked our text and noticed the 30 > symbol we had been over 45 mins which means we built an additional $32.00. ( at this point we wished we had gone with the street vendors that offered us initially at Columbus circle )We quickly rushed our bikes back and checked them in at the nearest kiosk. The plus side of things is that we had a great time riding them. Some of the bells didn't work ( I think we made 4 different bike transfers) and the bikes only have 3 gears. But it was a great way to see the city and Central Park. Very convenient and easy to manage. A few things to note-$101.00 holding charge per bike- no helmets provided - use disinfectant ( handles are kinda sticky)- no bike locks -you can check the bikes in any location - they do have a basket to carry things "
WillVenture,MIAMI BEACH,1,07/23/2016,Great concept; TERRIBLE in reality,"This is a great concept, but the reality of these bikes and locations is a distant cry from what we annual membership customers are actually receiving. I can't tell you how many times I have approached a bike station only to find that there are zero bikes available. Then, I search the citibike app and realize that there are no bikes available within 1.5 miles of my location. That means that I am wasting my membership. I either have to find an alternate means of transportation (walking, subway, taxi, etc.) or sit around, wasting time, waiting for someone to ride up and dock a bike. Then, I have to hope that the bike that person docks is not broken in someway (which many many of them are).Conversely, I can't tell you how many times I have been on a citi bike and have approached a docking station only to find that dock completely full of bikes… leaving me with no place to actually drop my bike off. Then, I again search the citi bike app only to find that there are no available docks within 1-2 miles. Long story short, at least 75% of the time there are no bikes when and where you need them. And when you need to drop one off, there are no available docking stations anywhere near your destination. Obviously this company is doing almost nothing to distribute the bikes properly and relocate them rapidly and efficiently. On top of all of this, the bikes themselves are terrible. The handlebar grips are ridiculously gross, and there has not been a single ride I have taken (over 100 of them at this point) where I have not had my hands covered in black, sticky rubber when I get off of the bike. The brakes almost never work very well, and the gears are even worse than the brakes.This concept is great, especially in a city like NYC. But this company is run so poorly, that I would highly recommend not wasting your money on either a single ride or an annual membership. It is not worth it."
annierose5,"Edina, Minnesota",5,07/23/2016,Bike NYC!!!!,I rented a Citi Bike and biked from Brooklyn to the 911 Memorial up the Hudson to the Chelsea Market to the East Village down the East River back over the Brooklyn Bridge to my hotel in Brooklyn and is was amazing !!!! It is a great way to see the city and get to places you would never otherwise come across. YES - NYC has bike paths and it is safe and so much fun - do it!!!!

Franklyn R,,3,07/15/2016,Almost a good experience. ,I rented this bike for the first time as it was stationed right outside my job. Used it to go from East 61 street to 42nd Times Square as a form of getting some work out on my legs. First let me say that they have comfortable sits and ride smooth. Now I Was not that pleased with the 12 dollar fee plus tax as I was only going to rinse it there and to top it off mid way to my ride it started pouring down and I couldn't ride it anymore so I lost out. I can see it been only for tourists or people with money not for everyone. 
mbmikemjb,"Portland, Oregon",1,07/15/2016,Total rip off.,"While visiting New York over the 4th of July holiday, I joined friends on a bicycle ride around Battery Park, crossing the Brooklyn Bridge, and up along the Hudson River for a great lunch. I discovered a charge on my credit card that stunned me. City Bikes of New York will rent you a bike for 24 hours for 12 dollars but, in the fine print, you must check in every one-half hour or you will be charged $4.00 for every 15 minutes after that until the bike is returned. Now, how many unsuspecting tourists make the mistake of renting a City Bike and find that charge on their cards. Can you imagine crossing the Brooklyn Bridge - back and forth - and checking in with the bike every one-half hour. I highly recommend renting a bicycle from a reputable rental agency - Not CitiBikes of New York."
boginball,"Longview, Washington",5,07/14/2016,Great way to get around ,The citi bike is a great way to see New York. It is easy to rent and there are many places to bring it back. I recommend riding through Central Park.
KlausG315,"Bronshoej, Denmark",4,07/14/2016,Convenient way of getting around,The Citibikes are a very easy way of getting from A to B in NYC. It is not a sight or experience in itself.
saulc751,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",3,07/08/2016,Great - but longer between re-checks please,"Great idea and although traffic makes some parts of NYC unsuited to cycling, it's a concept sure to increase in popularity.However...could the 30 minute timeframe between check-ins please be extended? Cycling around Central Park made the experience a bit stressful as we were perpetually trying to find stations to dock the bikes, re-scan the credit card and have a new number issued to take the bike out again. Also a bit of a shame that in an otherwise fantastic number of bicycle stations, there were no stations north of mid-park.Also, helmets (as found with similar programmes in other cities) might be a nice addition for safety."
okaka211,"Palm Beach Gardens, Florida",1,07/08/2016,STAY AWAY FROM CITI BIKE!!!,"BE PREPARED TO PAY EXTRA FEE!! Their app won't show that the docking station are not function in the map and charged you for overtime fee for the time you spent in docking the bike and searching for the nearby available spots!! Even you called the customer service, their representative have the worst attitude ever and are not helping at all!! The second thing is, even we received the text message stating that we docked our bike (and within 30 min) they still charged us for overtime fee. After calling the customer service, their response is that in their system its overdue by an hour!!! Won't use citi bike ever again in NYC."
Crista Z,,5,07/06/2016,Perfect way to get around the city quickly!,"My 13-year old and I picked up, rode, and dropped off bikes all over Manhattan and Brooklyn. Except for one bike that had a noisy fender, each bike ran smoothly and safely. DEFINITELY recommend for tourists who want quick and efficient transportation between activities."
Pawelp7,"Austin, Texas",5,07/04/2016,Let you see NYC from a totally new perspective ,Citi bike is an awesome way to see some hidden and less obvious attractions of NYC. If you're keen to sightsee actively this cultural-ruch city - it's a must do!The infrastructure od the bikes worked smooth - 12$ per day keeping each ride to max 30min. We loved it!
Brad H,"Bellingham, United States",5,07/03/2016,Manhattan via Citi Bikes,"My 24 year old daughter and I spent three days running around Manhattan doing several touristy things which included renting Citi Bikes. We rode the paved West and East Greenway trails, rode around Central Park, and utilized the dedicated bike lanes in the city. At the end of our trip we compared notes and we both agreed utilizing the Citi Bike app and bike system was our favorite part of our NY experience. "
JOENYC1000,"New York City, New York",5,06/23/2016,Not really designed for tourists,As a resident and user of citibike. Tourists are usually better off using one of the bike hire companies if you want a bike for a for than an hour. Remember you only get 30 mins before you have to dock the citi bike then wait a couple of minutes before you can ride again. Plus extra fees for going over the 30 min add up fast! You can use them just be aware of the extra hassle you will have over regular users with a year membership. We just turn up and go with our bike key for instance. They are designed to take a lot of abuse /use so are heavy 45lb and have 3 hub gears for a reason ! You do get a fair amount of exercise though riding one for 45mins + . The daily / hourly hire bikes are a lot lighter.
TravelJunkie6420,"New York City, New York",4,06/23/2016,So much more than just means of transportation,"I've been riding Citi Bike's for over a year now. I suffer from panic disorder and no longer ride the subway since it's a trigger for an attack. Faced with very little options for getting to and from work, Citi Bikes literally saves my sanity and bank account. If it wasn't for this nifty and healthy way of getting around, I'd be left broke and feeling helpless. I almost always find a bike and if I don't, there are several stations within walking distance that I can get one. My only wish is that they'd release lighter feeling bikes. The ones we have now are a bit clunky, but aside from that, they're great!"
amiemadd,"Woodside, New York",5,06/23/2016,"wear a helmet and yield to trucks, seriously","I commute to work on citibike, It solves everything!  Lose weight, enjoy fresh air, lower carbon footprint, focus mind!"
C8810CAmaryd,"Littleton, Colorado",5,06/12/2016,Fun and economical way to sightsee in Manhattan!,"On a whim, after being too tired to walk but not wanting to take the subway, we decided to try out the Citi Bikes and are SO glad we did! They are heavy, but probably for good reason to deter thieves; they only have 3 gears, but it's really all that's needed to get around the city for sightseeing purposes. We went all the way up to almost 60th from clear down near Wall Street. We happily pedaled past all the people stuck on West Side Highway in the traffic as we went up the bike path. We took our bikes across on 20th and it was wonderful to have the dedicated bike lane along that beautiful residential street of brownstones. It was easy to pull up the map of different bike stations. We docked our bikes for dinner and then after seeing a movie, went in search of more bikes to head back to our hotel way up on 57th street. It was cool to be able to access another set of bikes within the 24 hour period. We really enjoyed being on the bikes - and agree with other reviews about the usefulness of this transportation mode - you can really whip around the city at a clip which outdoes the subway, cab and own personal car."
Karim A,,5,05/17/2016,Visit Manhattan using Citi Bikes,"The concept comes from my home town's Bixi bikes. Manhattan being a relatively small island, you can visit many areas in a single day. I did the entire lower side (59th all the way south to Soho, The Village, West in Hell's Kitchen, the East side, Union Square, the University area, etc.). And biking alongside the river is such a pleasure. Stopping by in parcs, coffee shops, boutiques, terrasses, etc."
martianwalrus,"New York City, New York",4,05/04/2016,How to see the Big Apple above ground,"If you want to really get a good look at NYC without taking one of those awful double decker bus rides or spending your time underground or paying too much for a taxi, why not try Citibike? This is a really easy way to get from attraction to attraction, or just take a spin, for not very much money. I live here and I own my own bike, but I still use Citibike on occasion, especially for longer distances or when I'm going to Brooklyn or Queens. I'll take a subway for the long distance and then a Citibike for local connections. Try it out!"
AndreasNYC,"New York, NY",5,05/03/2016,Citi Bike is a great way to get around NYC!,Bring a helmet and get around town fast and drop off your bike near your destination for the next person to use! This has revolutionized my transportation! It is especially good for riding across town or diagonally in Manhattan where there are no subways. It's also great to use along with subways to get closer to where you need to go and to get there faster!
Great1MSG,,5,05/01/2016,I love Citi Bike,"It's has greatly improved the ability to get around the city in a timely, cost-efficient way. Citi Bike is the best way to commit to healthy, active lifestyle at a fraction of the cost of joining a gym. Highly recommended!"
Sara K,"Lymington, United Kingdom",5,04/27/2016,Great way to visit Central Park,"The two of us hired Citi bikes to ride around Central Park and loved the experience. We were used to hiring bikes in other cities so knew the system, even though the handlebars can be heavy but such an excellent way to see a new place and very good value. We had a particularly sunny day in Central Park which made the experience that more pleasurable and we just had to remember not to get in the way of the horse drawn carriages, runners and skaters. Definitely the best way to see the Park!"
Radik K,"New York City, New York, USA",5,04/22/2016,"Gets you where you want to go, and cuts through traffic!","Citibike is great because it's all over the city and can easily be used to get almost anywhere you need to go with CitiBike stations. The bikes are reliable and easily cut through traffic and congestion that Public Transportation is normally susceptible too. It's great for a run to the store, or a ride home after spending time with friends and exploring the city. Sometimes it's hard to find free bikes or free stations to park them at but not bad."
Kafpro,"New York, New York, United States",5,04/19/2016,USE IT ALL THE TIME,"Commute. Run short errands. Most of the time bikes are available. I've had two bikes stolen, even though I locked them up. Citi Bike solves that problem for commuting and shopping. Orientation on the seat is good. Upright seating gives high visibility to see cars and for them to see you. The bikes are heavy, but stable. Better for transportation than exercise, but useful for sightseeing. Highly recommended way to experience New York City and its neighborhoods."
Rob435808,"New York City, New York",5,04/19/2016,Indispensable part of NYC's transit system,"CitiBike is a blast. Getting around New York is about picking the right tool for the job. Virtually any trip of less than twenty or thirty blocks is done better, faster, and cheaper on a CitiBike. I just wish they had more stations and more availability."
Jenny R,"Melbourne, Australia",5,04/17/2016,fantastic day - thanks Citi Bikes,"Our plan for the day was to go over to the 89th Street Community Garden on the Hudson to see a tulip festival and then hire citibike bikes and go for a bike ride along the Hudson River, around Battery Park and then a little way up the East River to Manhattan Bridge and up and over that to Brooklyn for a view back over to Manhattan and a pizza at Juliana's.....when I woke up I thought 'maybe I should just go for a walk in Central Park'...but then I thought 'go on the bike ride, it's something you haven't done..it's always been too cold on previous trips'...so I put the coffee on now and I should be OK....if it not great fun we can just go down the Hudson, dock the bikes earlier than planned and head to Central Park on foot!But....we made it...all the way...by the time we got to the bikes at 79th, I'd psyched myself into thinking we'd just ride down the Greenway on the Hudson and get to Battery Park and that would be enough. But nope, all the way....just goes to show what no prep except for walking about 15,000 steps a day for almost 3 weeks and a carb breakfast of fruit and bagel and two cups of coffee can do. Oh I did have half a very sweet protein bar at the bottom of Manhattan Bridge too...We started riding at 75th ish, loved seeing everyone out and about, including volunteers working on plantings and children playing ball and parents having a great time playing tiggy with their children (even if they did look like they were huffing and puffing a bit). We got to 41st in the first half hour, the bike docking station was full, but there was a Citibike employee there who helped enormously. So then we got to Chambers and West and swapped again. That was a fast ride too, no stopping for photos because we'd walked those two parts of length the Greenway last year in Winter and taken squillions of photos of the art and the remnants of the piers and the views, and because I have probably already taken enough photos of trees in bloom and daffodils and tulips and hyacinths. The next part of the ride was slower, gorgeous park land, I think on the river side of Brookfield Place...not quite sure; could have been Robert F Wagner Jnr Park. A few photos there. Another reason we didn't take heaps of photos is we'd been on the AIANY boat ride around the whole island the other day and I'd taken squillions of photos of the views then. When we got to Battery Park and we decided we could make it all the way, so we swapped bikes at the East side of that Park. We are going to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island on Monday, so we'll be back there then and that's when I will take more photos of trees in bloom and daffodils and tulips and hyacinths. The last bike swap was at Forsyth and Canal. Then we went up and over the Manhattan Bridge, wow - so much better than Brooklyn Bridge. The cyclists and pedestrians are on paths on two different sides of the bridge (mostly) and the path is wide and the incline not too steep. No photos, I wanted to get over without stopping just to prove I could. And I could. We parked the last of the five bikes we each hired at the river end of Parke's Camdan Plaza Park, walked around the corner past the huge line at Grimaldis, got in the short line at Juliana's and was in there 5 minutes.In all it took a little over 2 hours. (It would take much longer to ride it if you stopped for photos..if you want to do this to take photos...I would walk it. There are a gazillion photo opportunities.) The bike docking stations were easy to find...I'd mapped stations on the Greenway and elsewhere so we didn't need to ride in traffic at all. The 30 minute time limit thing without paying extra worked fine. The paths are wide, lines are marked to clearly divide the oncoming bikes from each other, and sometimes the pedestrians and the cyclists. It was a bit of a free for all around a pretty ugly area of construction near the South St Seaport, but mostly it was very easy, very attractive and great. We loved it: 10/10 to Citibikes."
pauli B,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",4,04/08/2016,Pretty cool idea!,"We were on a 2 night family trip to NYC, trying to squeeze a bunch of fun in to a limited amount of time. The weather was nice, so we were in Central Park for a bit. My son (13) and I rented two bikes from the CitiBike stand at the top of the park. We road the entire length (mostly downhill) of the park and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, there wasn't a drop off bike rack at the bottom of the park, which is our bad for not sorting that out first. And our phones weren't working right, so we struggled with the app. BUT we were able to get the bikes into a drop off rack about 1/2 way up the park within in the 2nd half hour, so all was good. So you pay $10 for the day (24-hour period). The first 30 minutes are included. The next (and subsequent) 30 minutes cost only $4, so that's pretty affordable. If you're slick (and it's completely legal), you ride for 29 minutes and drop the bike off. Wait a minute or two, and check it back out for the next 29 minutes, which might be free. The trick, though, is knowing where the racks are (and there's an app, we just had cell phone issues). Seems like commuters use the bikes within the city, as we saw the racks at subway/transportation centers. And your $10 means you can hop on/off a bike throughout that day. We didn't take advantage of that, but $14 for an hour seemed pretty affordable for NYC. And it was perfect for the park! Bikes were adult size, so not suitable for little kids. Also no helmets. But all good. Oh with a cute bell on each bike!"
BeerVenturer,"Amherst, Massachusetts, United States",5,04/02/2016,Great concept!,"Citi Bikes are everywhere! I'm a regular cyclist (mountain and road) and don't really like urban riding. And always wear a helmet... Last visit to NYC rented and Citi Bike and road from Battery Park along West Side bike trail to George Washington Bridge. Good trail, fairly busy so you need to stay on your toes... If you plan on using these bikes (which I'll do again) and you value your health, bring a helmet! And they're EVERYWHERE!!"
Mrzlaratte,,1,03/31/2016,HORRIBLE! Extra charges and awful customer service. ,"The idea of bike rental in NYC is pretty great, however, the whole docking the bike every 30 minutes is very difficult. The second you take a bike out, it feels like you need to be thinking about the next docking station. Many times, stations would be full of bikes but none were available for rental. At one point, we walked around for about 45 minutes looking for a station with bikes we could take out, which defeated the purpose of having them. The $200 hold for about a week is just ridiculous.. Not even a hotel or resort charges such a hold for so long. I dealt with it tho, because I was told about it before renting so I knew what I was getting myself into. THE WORST PART IS, that a week after we rented the bikes, and extra charge of $184 was charged to my card. Apparently, one of my bikes ""wasn't returned and someone found it the next day"", which is clearly a lie because I returned both bikes at the same time. I can't begin to describe the frustration I felt when I saw this. The customer service representative was EXTREMELY RUDE and basically said ""it is what it is, nothing can be done"". How convinient for them to say that my bike was found the next day without any proof. They can essentially say what they want and charge you whatever they can get away with. STAY AWAY! I am currently dealing with this charge directly with my bank and will never rent Citi Bike again. "
RosannaDe,"Cleveland, Ohio",1,03/30/2016,Awful! Don't do it ,Very misleading and frustrating approach to renting a bike. It takes longer to figure out the next docking station than to rent the bike. The process is easy but what they DON'T tell you is that they will take $110 per bike for 3-5 days (I have seen up to 10 days) as a hold for renting the bike. Here's to hoping they get this right within 3-5 days or they will be hearing from me daily! 
ToppieUSA,"New York City, New York",4,01/13/2016,"Citi Bike, getting better every day!","I have been a Citi Bike member since its inception. While I liked it from the beginning, I must say they have improved hugely over the last year: there are many more stations, the app is more reliable, the docking stations function better, the bikes are maintained pretty well, and the customer service is fine (the best thing: I don't need them that often anymore...). The re-balancing could be further improved, though. Also, for visitors the 30 minute ride limit is very short. Especially because they typically don't know the city that well and need a bit more time to find out where the docking stations are. Maybe introduce a ""premium"" short rental option: a bit more expensive, but with a 15 minute ride extension? Apart from this, Citi Bike is moving into the right direction. Keep on biking, a great way to move from A to B and to explore the city!"
Elena C,,4,12/25/2015,NOT FOR TOURIST SIGHSEEING,This is a service for locals and commuters as you rent for 30 minutes at a time. Keep the bike for longer and you will start paying fees. If you are a well organised tourist it is a good way to circumnavigate manhattan. Download the Bike Me App and not the NYC Bikes app.
Ian G,,1,12/23/2015,Unlawful holding of deposit?,"We had a few issues with the Citi bike system consistent with what others are saying. We will not use it again.1. The 30 min check in and check out is very restrictive for tourists. Suggest Citi bike make this to 45 mins standard especially for areas like jersey city where there are not many stations, as it's difficult to get between stations in 30 mins. 2. When purchasing the hire, clearly indicate on the screen that you will hold from my bank account a $101 deposit per bike for 10 days (as we were told by customer service - it's in the fine print of the terms & conditions) very sneaky. That's my money you are holding to use as you wish. Unlawful?3.not very clear instructions on how to reset the bike after 30 mins. By chance we found by inserting the credit card each time we could continue our journey. 4. The lock system failed at one stop on one bike. We got it to work 2 mins after the 30 mins time slot expired. When tried to continue the system would only allow 2 of the 3 bikes to work. After 20 min phone call with cust service we could continue after they withdrew the overtime penalty fee. Graciously Do they want tourists to use it or local workers? That's something for their marketing team to work on. It's a great idea but needs some refining of the system if they want the tourist business."
EddNM,"Coleraine, United Kingdom",2,12/14/2015,"Great Idea, Bad Service",There's of us hired bikes at a reasonable $9.95. The set up round the city is great and the App works very well. However watch the $101 dollar charge. They take this out of your account as Security. Unfortunately it takes up to 10 days to be put back. This meant as I hired three bikes I lost $303 dollars from the Travel Money Bank Card we had brought. By the time I get the $303 back I'll be back in the UKAlso you can only cycle for 30 mins before you have to dock the bike (though you can't take it straight back out for another 30 minutes). This really should be 45 minutes so that you can actually get somewhere before panicking about a docking station.Finally I think I would have paid $1000 dollars for the bikes just to get rid of the hordes of bike touts hard selling their own bikes and fighting and screaming at each other. Just not cricket that sort of carry on. 
Marina M,"Edmonton, Canada",3,11/27/2015,"Great Experience, horrendous overcharges","Riding on Citi Bikes in NYC on warm sunny days in November was a heavenly way to see the City. BUT BEWARE - you can only take the bikes out for 30 mins at a time, misleading, coz the charge is for a 24 hour period, and if you go over you get charged $4 for 4 mins late, then another $15 for the next 5 minutes. I GOT BACK TO A VISA CHARGE OF $233 because the bIke didn't lock back into the docking station properly. I have complained and hope they'll refund it. A LOT OF FUN BUT HORRIBLY EXPENSIVE. Citi Bike you need to change your customer info. I'm sure it's the overages that pay for the system. We're tourists we don't know your ways and this charge ruined what was otherwise a wonderful visit in a very friendly, pretty City. Citi Bike, do the right things."
rossk324,,3,11/27/2015,"Handy, but only half hour slots!","The Citi bikes are really handy for getting about Manhattan. Easy enough to use, but you only have half an hour before you have to re dock. When you do re dock you have to re enter your details and obtain another code, which is annoying. The bikes themselves have 3 gears and are well maintained. "
JessicaJNZ,"London, United Kingdom",3,11/17/2015,Midtown aplenty,"Keen for a day-out riding a bike through Central Park? Citi Bike has plentiful locations around midtown, and within 2 minutes walk of the lower corners of Central Park. One request though: Citi Bike please add locations around the north end of Central Park. Central Park is so vast that it would be nice if you could hire a bike to ride from north to south, but alas you can only hire them south side at present."
Dino328,"Dublin, Ireland",4,10/27/2015,Fair play....,"While visiting NYC recently we took out a couple of Citi Bikes to head over to Brooklyn. The cost was $20 for two bikes for 24 hours, great value and once you do not go over the 20 minutes per journey you will not be charged any more than the $10 per bike rental.When I arrived home I realised I was charged an additional $160 on my credit card. I contacted Citi Bike and it seemed we did not return one of the bikes securely to the docking station and it was still classed as out on rental. Even though this was technically our fault Citi Bike kindly refunded the additional charge in full.One thing I found while having the bike on hire was trying to locate the docking stations as they seemed to be down side streets..?? So I had an idea which may or may not work. How about having a single blue line on the road coming from the docking stations onto the main street's which would help guide Citi Bike users to the stations..??"
Ruth H,"Randalstown, United Kingdom",3,10/25/2015,Citibike use in Manhatten,"this was our first time using any kind of citi bike service so a word of warning for all newbies - take care to read all the information and note the 30 minute limit! we weren't so careful and got caught out the first day but entirely our own fault so no complaints about that! The whole concept of the bikes is great and the startions are plentiful in the areas we were using them though unfortunatly in the evening time the bikes at the stations just disappeared - during the day wasnt an issue but by 5pm there was a serious lack of bikes in all of the stations around the touristy areas of times square/broadway.I would definitely recommend downloading the free app, that way you can see where there are available bikes closest to you rather than treking from one station to another.Docking and undocking the bikes should be simple and certainly inputting the machines little printout code to unlock the bike works very well, i found the locking a little more tricky, on several occasions i would dock the bike get the orange waiting light then back to red again. eventually my husband took over the docking duty and with the use of sheer brute force managed to dock bikes on first go.Getting the green light is however no guarantee that the bikes are registered back on the system, On one occasion we docked both bikes and half an hour later when we returned to get two bikes again we were refused a code because we apparently still had two bikes out. Calling the number on screen was no help either because the lady in customer services was unable to do anything to help. we were promised a call back within half an hour by her supervisor who apparently would be able to take the bikes off our account but that never came. For all intents and purposes leaving us stranded in Chelsea a few miles from home. We used another card and opened another account but now have to go though the process of fighting fees and getting a refund and having not started that yet I don't know how successful that will be! Overall i think a great service and the reason for the average rating is the shocking customer service which by any standards should be so much better. Also if you are comparing prices to london ($9.95 per 24hrs vs £2) it does look expensive."
Jesper P,"Holstebro, Denmark",1,10/20/2015,Worst customer service ever!,"Last week my buddy and i purchased a 24 hour pass. It was a great experience for arround one hour. Then my friend docked his bike at the station in the Finiancial District and it was locked immovably. But when he tried to rent a new one the system claimed that the bike unlocked and unregistered. The rules says that if you do not dock your bike every 30 minute you'll get charged. And if you lose a bike or destroy it during the rental you'll have to pay 1200 dollars! Basically that seemes fair enough but it means that you're not able to move on as long as the system doesn't approve your bike as locked.So we called the customer service, and they gave us some techniques to get the bike out of the dock but it was docked rock-solid. We tried for 30 minutes while speaking with them on the phone but they could not help us. Neither us or any other customer were able to get the bike out of the dock. If so it would have been no problem to try another dock and move on. But we were stranded.In the end we had to give up but we took some pictures of the docked bike and send the evidence to Citi Bikes . We also informed them about the bike number and the dock number. In spite of that they wouldn't agree to stop our tour. They told us that we just had to wait until a mechaninc would stop by and fix the problem. But they could not tell us when. Thanks for nothing!That meant that we had to stop biking and we did not know how they would charge us. The same evening my buddy called the custumer service again. At that point they told him that the bike still was not registered as locked, but they assured him that they would not charge him for at lost bike. But.....This morning Citi Bike withdrew 1200 dollars from his account! Now we have to fight with insurance companies, banks and a foreign company (we are danes) to get his money back. All because of a miserable customer service. I'm deeply schoked and i have never encoundtered such horrible management in my whole life. I would recommend everyone to avoid Citi Bike i New York City.The biking experience is great though but choose a decent and serviceminded company. Stay away from Citi Bike."
gregs81,United Kingdom,5,10/16/2015,Great way to get around NYC,"Had a great time seeing the city on bikes... I'm not a big fan of getting cabs and getting to and from where wanted to go would take to long walking...We were all over Manhattan and in Brooklyn and had no problems finding places to park the bikes. We should've read up on the cycle lanes though cos they really make a difference. My wife wasn't so keen on busy streets. Also the bikes are very sturdy and one size fits all... I'm 6'7 and usually struggle on normal sized bikes but the extendable seat and the long fame suited me to a t...It's a great way to get around - good exercise, fresh air and what away to burn of the brunch calories.Cheers.

beths794,"Brockton, Massachusetts",5,09/30/2015,Excellent way to get around NYC!,"I was with my 2 teen-agers & this was the PERFECT way to get around NYC for a very reasonable price! I was definitely ""nervous"" but once I got past that, I was so glad I let the kids talk me into this! Just be sure not to keep the bikes out for longer than 1/2 hour at a time which may not seem very long but you can get anywhere by bike in NYC in less than a 1/2 hour. There's an app that works well when looking for locations to pick up or drop off at!"
ILoveFoodComa,"Burbank, California",2,09/18/2015,Confusing to use,I have seen this kind of bike rental in Europe all the time. Seeing in NY city.... bright blue color bikes.... get my attention right away!I try to look at the rental machine.... VERY COMPLICATED & CONFUSING!!! So not user friendly...... It is a great idea to commute in the city by bikes but seeing so many bikes parking there... make me wonder maybe the price or the operation is not so efficient that is why people don't utilize it.
erininwanderland,Ottawa,4,09/14/2015,"So easy, glad I pushed through my fear of biking in NYC!","I was really nervous about the idea of renting bikes and touring around NYC. Traffic is unreal and the drivers (and cabs!) are crazy. But, I pushed through and did it anyway and I'm SO GLAD that I did!The bike rental was so easy and there were so many locations to drop the bike off at. A few of the downsides -- it was hard to load the app on my phone, the download was HUGE and since I was traveling outside of Canada, I didn't want to waste my data. The rental time also felt a bit short for what you were paying.All in all, I'd definitely do it again -- it was a great way to tour around the city."
Charles F,"Chicago, Illinois",1,09/12/2015,Terribly unresponsive customer service,"I purchased 4 week-long passes when visiting NYC. I had no problems with it the first day, but on the second, the system claimed we didn't properly dock one of the bikes and rescinded use of one of our passes. We had followed all instructions for docking but the customer service representatives could offer us no recourse until they ""recovered"" the bike which underhandedly shifts liability to the customer.When I finally spoke to a supervisor, she promised a full refund which I did not receive. When I contacted customer service four days later, I received no response. It has been seven days since I last contacted Citi Bike's customer service and still no response.I have used bike rental systems in multiple cities and they all have similar flaws but I have never encountered such uninterested customer service."
Paul D,,1,09/09/2015,RIP OFF!,"Please be warned. These bikes are available throughout Manhattan as well as other places. My wife and I innocently rented 2 bikes from the Central Park stop. It was fairly clear $10 for 24 hours rental. Ha, but wait a minute: that only allows you to take the bikes for 30 minutes at any given time. Even 1 minute over and they'll deduct another $4 from your card. Better still if you allow the second 30 minutes to elapse, they'll take another $9 from your card! My wife and I missed the first 30 minute deadline by 2 minutes, making our quick ride around Central Park $28 + tax. Furthermore, we checked our debit card and we saw a hold from NYC Bike Share, aka Citi Bike of $202!! We called them and they said they always do that and it would take 10 days to be returned. Please be warned and use one of the other bike rental companies where you can rent clearly by the hour or day etc. Furthermore, riding anywhere other than central park you're taking your life into your own hands. Impossible to ride anywhere."
Gloria S,"Palmdale, United States",3,09/03/2015,Central Park rental,"Great idea... biked central park (08.31.15) and loved doing it on a bike! I failed to read the fine print (my bad) so be advised of the below! I am ok with the transaction as long as I get my deposit back with no additional charges!!What you need to know... - They charge you $101 per bike as a deposit.- If you buy the 24 hour pass for $9.95 that it does not mean you can ride for 24 hours, it means you have access to the bike for 24 hours but you have to dock every 30 minutes or you are charged overtime fees ($4 additional for 30-60 minutes over, $9 for 60-90 minutes over, and $12 for every additional 30 minutes after).- If you are docking every 30 minutes, you will have to use your credit card again (on 24 hours access) to get a new ticket for the next 30 minute bike rental.- Download the app prior to renting so that you can find docking stations. Some docking stations may be full so use the app to find the closest docking station with available spots.- There are no kickstands! Feel this is important in the event you want to stop and take pictures. My biked slipped out of my grip and landed on my leg and gave me a huge nasty bruise =o)- Make sure when you dock that the bike is locked in and the green light turns on indicating bike is locked in. I have read people being charged for faulty sensors which did not receive the bikes but I am sure that may be a rare case.I was basically charged $27.00 for maybe one and a half hours. I guess that isn't too bad... beats having to walk through the park!"
Aus_Harry,"Wollongong, Australia",5,09/01/2015,Great way to get around NYC,"We caught cabs, We walked the streets, we caught the subway, and then we rode Citi Bikes ! What a great way to explore the city. The fastest way to get around and the car and taxi drivers are very courteous. The ride over Brooklyn bridge was fantastic. Highly recommended. "
Braveheart14,"Hamilton, New Zealand",5,08/25/2015,Getting roung New York,Didn't know about this great system before we got there but quickly onto it and used it everyday. Once you get the hang of it very convenient and easy to use.
411markuss,,5,08/19/2015,Perfect way of getting around in NYC ,"What a great way of getting around in NYC. The system works very well and is cheap. You need to get used to the fact that you only have 30 free minutes per ride included in the daily rent of 10 dollars, but actually that makes lots of sense. These bikes are a means for transportation. But you have so many bike stations south of Central Park (for visiting Central Park by bike you will need to hold on longer to the bikes and pay a little extra), that you can pick a new bike whereever you want. I do recommend to download the app, which tells you which stations have bikes and free bike parking available and the latter can sometimes be a problem. But if you end up a full station, the system will give you additional free 15 minutes to find an empty one. Also get yourself a map that shows the bike paths, particularly the ""green"" ones that are separate bike lanes, which are safe. The nicest and very convenient one to get from North to South is along the Hudson River. Bottom line: forget the metro, get on the bike!"
775katek,"Farmington, New York",4,07/19/2015,Nice Alternative to Walking for Tourists if You're On the Greenway,"After riding the Circle Line, we wanted to check out Chelsea Piers, and then get to Battery Park. It was Saturday morning, the walk was going to take an hour, and we spotted the Citi Bikes. After some debate, we picked up 3 bikes across the street from the Piers and rolled down the Greenway - a dedicated biking and running path along the harbor. The ride was lovely. The bike path is convenient, has it's own traffic controls, and runs along an area that has been BEAUTIFULLY developed. It was a great experience and offered up some incredible views of the city and the Freedom Tower. I would suggest this option to anyone visiting the city. With the following notes...- You need to be a confident rider. Even in the dedicated bike path it can be tricky.- Keep your eyes peeled at every crosswalk. Most people aren't paying an ounce of attention.- Ride the city streets at your own risk! Drivers aren't that concerned with cyclists - I almost got the cab door treatment. My only knock on Citi Bike is the location of the bike racks. They can be tricky to find, they didn't appear on Google Maps, which is the key to my survival, and the map on their website isn't very detailed and doesn't locate you via GPS."
Jay-Gladstone,"Miami, Florida",4,07/19/2015,Very Fun Experience,"Renting a Citi Bike can be a very fun activity, as you can easily ride and explore through the city. You can park in any Citi Bike location and simply move around the city. Riding through Central Park was a great experience that would personally recommend."
E128XQalexc,"Midland, Michigan",5,07/17/2015,Fun through central park,"We rented these bikes and followed the road through the park. 
The bike rental staff were friendly and helpful. The bikes were in good condition. We will be doing this again when we visit NY."
sdcyclist,"San Diego, California",5,07/13/2015,"Rent one, it is fun","Biking around NYC is a little scary if you are timid. But being able to hop from one bike station to another is fun and seeing NYC by bike is amazing. Make sure you switch bikes within the 30 minute window or you will get charged $5. And if you go through Central Park, know that there are not stations in that area. "
Denrejsendedansker,"South Elgin, Illinois",2,07/13/2015,Citi Bike turned Very Expensive,"Citi Bike New York bike rental is a Manhattan wide burb side bike rental company that make it easy to pick up a bike on the spot. It's curbside pay machine makes you believe that if you buy a 24 hour pass that you can rent the bike for 24 hours a one flat rate. What is not crustal clear is that you must re-check the bike in to a curbside rack every 30 minutes. If you don't catch this very important information, the company will charge you a late fee every 30 minutes. My experience was for a rental on July 10th for two hours and forty-five minutes. What I understood to be a flat charge of $10 for a 24 hours rental became a $10 24 hour’s ticket fee plus a $ 53.37 charge for 30 minutes late charges. Citi Bike has a very poor business announcement of how Citi Bike rental charge for their bike rentals. Needless to say, I am highly disappointed of what I thought would be a good experience of viewing New York became a very expensive and frustrating event.I strongly recommend anyone planning of renting bikes from Citi Bike to spend a good amount of time understanding the rental terms.Also, Citi Bike must change their on screen billing information making it crystal clear of their charging terms and conditions."
James C,"San Francisco, California",5,05/31/2015,Best way to get around Manhattan,"Although they have yet to expand north of 59th street, Citi bikes is an awesome way to navigate Manhattan. 24 hour rental, use bikes for up to 30 minutes for free as many times as you like, surcharges for rides over 30 minutes. You can download an app for your phone that helps tell you where the docking stations are and how many bikes are available at each and how many empty docks there are to turn your bike in. If you get to a full dock you can press a button saying it was full and they let you have more time with no charge to find an empty dock. Believe me its not hard to find the stations they are every where and along the streets and avenues that have dedicated and separated bike lanes. This beats fighting for a taxi or climbing down down down and up up up out of the subways. Love this addition to New York"
JustusvanHoegee,"Delfgauw, The Netherlands",3,05/23/2015,"Nice concept, bikes are rare in some areas ",Rented a couple of bikes in Manhattan. Not easy if you are not early. In areas such as East Village it is easier but not great. Bikes itself are ok. Biking in NYC is not easy if you aren't used to biking in a city.
patob-in-ct,"Cape Town, South Africa",2,04/28/2015,Pity.... great idea ,We have done this in other cities and it has worked perfectly but the docking stations don't work properly. .... at a 30 bike station 7 don't work and you have to ride around looking for another station. We tried 4 that all had many docks not able to receive the bikes...... or being able to take 1 and them riding around looking for another ...... Not ideal for tourists as it wastes time and agrivates one!Pity.....
Elhan H,,1,04/10/2015,Not ideal for tourists,"We decided to get a 24 hour pass to ride over the Brooklyn Bridge and explore Brooklyn. Bad move. The Citibike concept is great, for locals, but unless you know the area well and where the stations are it is easy to go overtime. The bridge was packed which made cycling slow and difficult. Finding the next station was also not easy, and in fact one station marked on the map could not be found at all. 30 minutes gets eaten up fairly quickly when you deduct the time to release your bike and the time at the other end to find a station.One pass went to waste as we could not get the pin to release a bike in the first instance.When I got home and checked my credit card statement I found that I had been charged a second amount which effectively tripled the cost of each pass. Needless to say this is being disputed as it far exceeds any overtime fees we may have incurred.We walked the entire way back to Manhatten because the ride over to Brooklyn was so stressful."
WendyvD,"Leuven, Belgium",3,10/24/2014,Improvement needed!,"For Citi Bikes you pay 10 USD per day, or 25 for a week. You may make as many journeys of 30 minutes if you want. That is also the biggest limitation: if you go over 30 minutes, you pay extra. The advantage is that you don't need to worry if you don't want to use the bike for some time: you don't need a lock, because you can just drop it off at bikepoint.The system is now about a year old, and that means that there are still some problems. Sometimes you find a charging point completely full, or you can't manage to put the bike in. Then you need to look for another charging point. At one point we had dropped off the bikes, but afterwards we could not get another loan: the system had not registered that we had returned them. A phone call (via a gentleman in the adjoining office) has solved everything. You also need a lot of power to get the bikes out or put them back in. That is probably a vicious circle: people use a lot of power, so the system also breaks down. Sometimes lights turn red, but you can still take the bike. Sometimes there is no light, and it's impossible to take a bike. Sometimes it's impossible to borrow a bike because the machine is not working.The concept is certainly good, but still needs to be improved. At the end of the day we were a little frustrated.Back home we saw our credit card was charged more than expected: apparently we were, with one bike, 4 minutes in overtime, it costed us $4+taxes. This was due to technical problems: in the last charging point we could bring back only one bike, all the other locks were broken. We then had to go to another point, what caused the overtime."
874karenh,"Plano, Texas",2,10/21/2014,"The idea is great. The reality, not so much.","We saw the bikes around the city and decided to ride them from the Intrepid Museum back to our hotel (Conrad) in the financial district. We were able to pay (although it took a couple of tries) and get the bikes. We then rode to our hotel and dropped the bikes off at a station right outside our hotel. While we didn't have helmets to wear, we were able to ride on a beltway (green way? multi-use path?) that had a bike lane. So we were safe and not riding in the streets (which terrified me, and I ride a road bike in Dallas, TX on city streets). The second time we tried to rent bikes was after we got off the Staten Ferry. At this point we had a lot of issues. Codes wouldn't work, we couldn't get the machine to take our card, etc. After the 2 stations near the Ferry didn't work we walked over to one by a museum. We finally got it to work and got the bikes out. Then we went to take the beltway back to the hotel, but due to construction the path was blocked. We were unwilling to ride on the street, in the dark, so we parked the bikes and took a cab back. We tried to rent bikes again at Central Park, but my friend's code didn't work and we couldn't get the machine to take our card (yet again?!). We finally just gave up and walked around Central Park. Please keep in mind the bikes are heavy (at least 40 lbs) and you can't shift gears. While the idea of renting a bike is great, in reality it didn't really pan out so well."
TammyA843,Vermont,5,09/29/2014,TAKE A RIDE!,The weather was beautiful and the bikes are located everywhere. We downloaded the app. rented bikes for 24 hours and saw so much more of the city. I trip advisor for top things to do and we hopped onto the bikes and were there in no time. Simple app with so many bike locations. Just make sure to check the location has bikes before you go! 
mumadragon,Echuca,2,09/29/2014,Great way to get around if it worked,"We were very excited to rent our bikes for the day from Brooklyn to ride around to see the sights of Brooklyn and Manhattan but unfortunately very time we went to a new docking station the codes worked sometimes and then not at all, wasted sooo much time re entering the codes that it would of been quicker to walk. We also found it silly that yes you pay upfront the day fee then have to redo I your bike every 30minutes and I would of been charged more coz There was no way I could ride from Brooklyn to the nearest docking station in Manhattan in 30 minutes, this service needs to look at the day passes especially for older people who want to take there time getting around. We were then sooo rushed that we didn't get to enjoy the ride across the bridge. We do think it's a great idea if it works. "
cnido,"Winnipeg, Canada",2,09/24/2014,"Good idea, limited by operational issues","Citi Bike is a company that offers short-term bike rentals (30min) at several hundred different locations throughout New York City. They can be used for transportation, or for sight-seeing.We spent over a month in New York (for work), and the first week we were in town we did a 1 week unlimited pass for Citi Bike. A rental period longer than this was not an option as you need a NYC address for them to ship the key pass to.In theory, this would have been wonderful; however in practice, the system was non-functional. We did 2-4 rides per day for that week, and there was not a single time that the system worked properly. Common issues included:-Machine at bike depot would not read credit card. This is problematic as your 1 week pass is tied to your credit card. Being unable to read your credit card means you are unable to take a bike out. You would often need to insert your card 3-5 times before it would actually read it. This was an issue essentially every time we tried to take a bike out.-The code you were given to unlock a bike would not actually be a functional code. You would receive a code, only to find out that it would not unlock any bikes. You then have to wait 2 min for the lockout period to expire, before repeating the process and getting a new code. This happened about 50% of the time, and on one occasion it took doing this 5 different times before I received a functional code.-There are frequently no (working) bikes available at depots especially during peak hours. Citi Bike says they shuttle bikes around to meet demand, and I saw them doing this; however, it is not enough, and I'd often need to walk to several stations to find a bike to take out.-The website and app information about how many available bikes there are is inaccurate. An example would be the app saying there are 6 free bikes, you walking there, and the 6 bikes all being broken and unavailable to use. This was especially annoying given that finding a bike during peak hours can mean that you are walking to multiple stations.-If using bikes at late hours when there is low demand, it is difficult to find a station that has empty spaces to return your bike. On one occasion we spent over an hour trying to find a station with open spots to drop off our bike. This was made more difficult by the fact that the app would say there were open spots at a depot; however the spots it was saying were open were actually out of service. We tried calling Citi Bike and they had no more information than was available on the app - so they would recommend going to stations that ended up having no available (not broken) spots to return the bike. We were ultimately charged time overage fees for this because we spent so long trying to find an open depot to return the bikes - Citi Bike would not refund this.I would not use it again in its current form. I understand that they are currently being audited by the city for issues with operational expenses and improper equipment maintenance and may be bought out by another company in the near future. They seem like they need many operational improvements before I would use them again."

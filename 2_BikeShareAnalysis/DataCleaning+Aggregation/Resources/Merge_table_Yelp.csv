NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/27/2018,"It's not perfect, but I see Citibike as basically an essential public service that makes NYC more livable.I joined last summer and I'm so glad I did -- I get exercise, save $ on commuting, and, most importantly, save time getting from place to place. Yes -- sometimes there are app issues, or not enough bikes or docks available, or you get a bike with a bum seat, etc. It can't be perfect 100% of the time. But it's pretty freaking great. It's enabled me to see neighborhoods of this city I otherwise wouldn't, all on my own steam, faster than any other method would have allowed. It's enabled me to get to/from work in 10 minutes rather than 45 on the slow-as-molasses city bus. Given how terrible public transportation in NYC is these days (both subways and buses), it's been a lifesaver. - need to expand stations into northern Manhattan- need to pressure city to add more PROTECTED bike lines -- everywhere"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/02/2018,"Beware when signing up for the annual membership! Bad customer service with inflexible policies!! Seriously question your decision to sign up...It's rare that I post about a business as I'm in the customer service field myself, but this one deserves the warning blast. I signed up for Citibike because I got a job in New York. Exciting! I immediately got an annual membership after I received the offer as I was super excited to bike around this city and enjoy the flexibility of the drop 'n go service that city bike offers with their plethora of bike stations. I reckoned that even if I didn't use the 50+ rides required to offset the annual membership, the flexibility would be worth it. Now I'm seriously questioning my purchase...Unfortunately, I found out that my company offered a discount using a corporate code (great perk!). I submitted a request to Citi's customer service center through their site and received a stock response of ""Members have 14 days or less to cancel and receive a refund for their membersips."" Yes, that's the exact response. I didn't want to cancel my membership. I just wanted to get the discount applied and I was 3 days over the 14 day period. So I let it sit for a bit. Que sera, right? Well, not in this case. For some reason, the response irked me every time I saw a bike station (again, there are a ton of them...) so I called into their help center. I politely asked for an exception to the policy and they informed me that the policy was actually 30 days but I was now over that period so there was nothing that ""the system would allow them to do."" Being a customer service advocate, I calmly explained that they should be able to do a manager override. They talked to their supervisor and came back with the same response. When I asked to speak with the supervisor to explain, they declined. I offered some feedback amounting to Citibike gladly forgoing the small amount of money to keep a customer satisfied and bolster their reputation as a friendly, flexible company. I mean, it's founded on the concept of flexbility, right?! Not so much.In that final conversation, I discovered that their customer service is a call center that manages many bike share programs with a variety of directives that limit their ability override their system. How ridiculous is that?! A customer service management system that prevents you from offering good customer service? Unacceptable. Perhaps one of their agents will deem this public post worthy enough of a reasonable response and they'll make an exception to this 14 day nonsense that doesn't directly apply to my request. Citibike needs to stop treating their customers like numbers and start offering the service that's expected."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/23/2018,This used to be a nice town. This use to be a town where if you like to walk you walk down the street in peace. This used to be a town where if you're driving you drive down the street in peace. It was quite harmonious for New Yorkers. Then the darkness came. The citibike. Once they sit their asses on these cursed machines they ride down the streets disregarding every rule and law on the book. They mow down people on the sidewalk screaming for everyone to get out of the way. Ever since these things came to be it has been hell as a driver and a pedestrian and even a bi
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,04/23/2019,"I think Citibike is a wonderful service for the city, but it's customer service is:  wait for it .....unprofessional, reads from a script, cannot handle simple problems with simple solutions. It's Managing Director, whom I have spoken with twice is in the ball. His staff unfortunately is NOT.  I do nit write reviews, but Motivate, Citibike's operating company has a terrible with capital ""T"" customer service department. Two reps, SUMAYYA and KENDALL were passive aggressive, kept cutting off reception 4 x  phones. Please get your customer service reps name. Ask them to cure a simple issue. They hem and haw not to pass you thru to a Supervisor. This is a BLACK for Citibike. I seriously hope they clean up their act. It doesn't reflect well on the Bank. Having been a Bank president, when your customer service is shoddy, there is nothing you can say to the world to fix it up from a terrible phone presence. CITIBIKE get smart !!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/12/2019,"Not happy to be charged extra for using the electric bikes, even when i pay for the annual membership! Should just be a waived if you already spend $100 plus for the annual membership! NYC already has such a large population, I'm sure citibike makes more than enough money from memberships and day-pass users."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/31/2019,"This program is a complete scam!  I signed up for Citi Bike yesterday and thus far have taken about four trips.  For my last trip, I docked the bike and even received a notification buzz in the app.  Then hours later, I received an email claiming my bike was still out.  I called immediately--the representative told me that she could put a temporary hold on the account while a technician went out to find the bike at the station.  And oh--if it's not found, a lost bike is $1200.  This ruined my entire weekend---within 24 hours of signing up, to possibly face a payment of $1200 because the bike didn't buzz in the system is beyond the pale.  I would NEVER recommend this program to anyone and in fact am waiting for tomorrow to call elected officials and consumer agencies about this ridiculous program!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/03/2018,I have not used any citi bike since mid October which was my first and last time. I was charged the general single ride and the late fee which was taken out of my account and I was totally fine with that. Saw there was a charge for citibike in Brooklyn on November 3rd---- I live in Manhattan. Made a claims and received and absurdly rude response. Luckily my bank protects me from random charges like this
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/02/2019,"Trap for tourists. Seemed like a good idea until I got charged over 160$ after I stopped using it even though I locked it up properly as directed. To top it off I sent a complaint to customer service and they never responded. Bikes are low quality too but hey, maybe you like to pedal harder than needed."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/18/2018,"BE WARNED. TOURIST SCAM. THIS COMPANY WILL FIND WAYS TO CHARGE YOU EXTRA FEES AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REFUND.I got charged $108 for a 20 minute bike ride, that was supposed to be $3. Because the bike was ""not properly docked"". I had rode The bikes several times and it was for sure locked. But the timer on my app kept running. If this happens to you CALL IMMEDIATELY and you might not get charged. I learned the hard way. Every time I rode the bikes, the timer was lagging on my phone, after I locked the bike, but I knew it would stop, because it always did.  So I thought nothing of it. And I knew the bike was locked because I had done it several times, and it beeped, and I could not pull the bike out. I thought, there's no way they can charge me because the bike is locked, and they must know that.Well a couple days, later I saw on my debit card a charge for $108. I thought, that sucks, but no problem, this will will be  be a quick phone call and refund. NOPE. 5 calls later, and a few emails to management and the best they could do was refund half the money. So they still basically stole $50 from me.I don't live in NYC, and I know another person who the same thing happened to. It must be very common and for a company to make more money off ""error charges"" then legitimate use of their service, that's not cool. They make it really easy to mess up, and they charge you, and then they blame you and say it's your fault.Don't get me wrong, the few times I used the bikes it was amazing, and super convenient, and super fun. But I feel that this is poor business practice. And they do not care about the satisfaction of their customers, because they are making so much money and have lost touch with the human to human interaction. I am happy to pay $50 for something. But paying $50 for nothing is not business. It's a scam."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/04/2018,"This company (Citi Bikes) is actively and knowingly engaging in deceptive practices and consumer fraud.I leased two bicycles for 24 hours at $12 per bicycle, totaling $24. I returned them after 1 hour and 26 minutes, yet I was being $26.13, plus another fee of $34.84, totaling $60.97.I contacted their customer service and they maintain they charges are valid, they did nothing wrong, and refuse to issue a full refund of the second charge. They say they charge an additional $4 per bicycle for every 15 minutes after the initial 30 minutes. Then what's the point of renting for a 24 hour period?I've filed a dispute with my card's bank, and will be filing complaints with government agencies.STAY AWAY!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/31/2018,"These bikes make it easy to get around quickly and there are many stations to pick from...The bikes aren't in the best shape - the tires are kind of flat, some of the seats are broken with stuffing coming out, and the brakes could use some tightening.The pay stations clearly outline the way the charges work - pay $12.00 and you can ride unlimited for 24 hours but you have to re-dock the bike every 30 minutes and get a new bike each time.We pay for two bikes - $24.00 for 24 hours. We ride for about 20 minutes, re-dock, walk around, find new bikes... And get charged again because the system doesn't recognize that we had already picked up bikes. Another $24.00.We dock the bikes in Brooklyn, they lock in place, and we go about our day. Wake up this morning and have a message from Citibike claiming one of the bikes hasn't been docked and we are getting charged for $1,200.00. We have tried calling customer service to rectify this issue, and their suggestion was to trek down to Brooklyn to re-dock the bike... Which may or may not be there anymore since their locking mechanism failed... Looks like others have had this problem. When the locks fail due to a power outage or because the mechanics fail, its the consumer who pays, not the merchant. Customer service is a joke, and they make you feel like you're the one who has ripped them off.Not worth it due to the lack of customer service and the pathetic rigamarole they put you through."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/11/2018,"Horrible experience with Citi bike. The $3 per ride is only on the app. If you rent from the station, there will be $13.07 per day. They will double charge you if you ride over 30 minutes. I was charged $26.14 for a 40 minutes ride!   Don't use it!!!!! Horrible expensive!!!!!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/30/2018,"I was my first time today renting a Citi Bike. I took my first ride in prospect park, in Brooklyn. The App is pretty easy to navigate, and also getting the bike out of the dock. I had no problems with the bike I rode. I enjoyed my ride through the park. Hopefully there will be more bike stations in the area, closer to my house. Definitely will be riding more often, thank you Citi Bike."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/16/2019,"Almost as pathetic as the MTA.  Even little Indigo in Philly is way better,Can't find bike or cant find docks or they do not work.  They only survive as they are the only show in town.  There may be too many taxis and car-shares in NYC but not enough bikes around.  Come on NYC let some some other dock-less bike-shares (Lime, SPIN etc) in!"
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/30/2018,"This review is for the ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP. If you live in Midtown and Lower Upper East/West, this service is simply a waste of money.  This is coming from a previously very loyal customer. As an NYC local, I originally loved using citi bike and looked forward to renewing my annual membership. However, recently that opinion has changed. I would give the service a 1-star rating for recent months, and a 4 or 5-star rating for the service they sold me a year ago. Bikes are rarely available in Midtown and Lower Upper East/West. Take a look at the attached pics. Several months ago, I could get a bike whenever and travel around the city with ease. Now, that is rarely the case. 4/5 times I look to use the bikes, there isn't a bike in a convenient location. If you live in Midtown or Lower Upper East/West then don't get the bikes. I'm not going to renew for another year and may try to get a refund on the last couple months, as the service hasn't been as advertised. No bikes to use. I'm now hoping Uber's jump bikes come into town. Another cost effective option for locals like myself."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/13/2018,"Ah, Citi bike...what an adventure this was. Read on if you want to hear about the stuff nightmares are made of. I hadn't heard of this method of commuting, but my boyfriend suggested we give this a go as we were in town for the weekend. 24 hour accessibility for just $12? Sign me up! I briefly read through the general rules on the kiosk--firmly dock your bikes at citi bike stations, rides are limited to 30 minutes per session, helmets are suggested, stay alert, follow the rules of traffic. But what really caught my eye was the fee for a stolen bike coming in at a whopping $1200?! I pity the fools who have incurred this charge. I decided right then and there that I'd guard this bike with my life and would fend off anyone who'd attempt to poach it from me. NO WAY would I become a victim of this insanity. The bikes are decently kempt and you have the option of toggling between 3 different gears as well as being able to adjust the height of the seat. The citi bike is also equipped with a cute little bell that I shamelessly abused during my rides--I had become a biking maniac from the thrill and laughter that ensued throughout the day. Really, it was intoxicating. All was well until we attempted to check out another two bikes. We received an error message only allowing a discharge of 1 bike as the other bike was 'still in use'. My heart plummeted. I'm pretty sure I blacked out.Something must have malfunctioned at our former docking station, because both my boyfriend and I were POSITIVE we pushed them in correctly. We phoned support and they gave us the ID for the bike in question and were instructed to head back to our previous station. We rushed back only to find that it was missing. Someone had checked the bike out. 30 minutes passed, 60 minutes passed, 90 minutes passed and still no notification of this wretched bike having been returned. At this point I had already accepted my fate and made peace with myself that this'll definitely be the most expensive bike ride I've ever had. We were notified 2.5 hours later that the bike had FINALLY been returned to a station. We wept and sang and jumped with joy. All in all, I had a pleasant experience considering the circumstances...if you have any love for your derriere, avoid riding on cobblestone. And if you have any love for your wallet, DOCK YOUR BIKE CORRECTLY."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/11/2018,Citi Bike has terrible customer service. I'll never buy a gift membership from them again. I bought it as a gift for my wife 3 weeks ago and she still hasn't been able to get her new membership. This in spite of all my unanswered email/help requests and phone calls. They also didn't extend her membership or give her a further discount for our troubles (something I asked for). Instead they just charged her for a new full priced membership which meant we had to make yet another call to them.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/22/2018,"I've been a CitiBike user for the past two years now, and am very fond of the bike share system. I've got the annual membership, which costs about $140/year if you get the $25 may discount and a further 10% discount for Citibank card holders. CitiBike has spread immensely over the past couple of years, having great coverage over most of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn and Queens now. You can use CitiBike for leisure/commuting and also for exercise; its heavy weight (45 lbs) makes it a good workout if you take it on an up-slope (Try the Manhattan Bridge). Just remember one golden rule: dock your bike in 45 minutes (or 30 minutes if you're not an annual member) and double check that you see the green light and hear the beep when you dock it (or that could be your most expensive bike ride ever at $1200!!!). The only issue I've had so far is not finding a bike when I really need one, but CitiBike is trying to improve that through their new Bike Angels program. Additionally, if you're at the end of your time-limit and really need to dock your bike at a station but there aren't any empty docks (or someone sniped you), don't just pass by! Go to the kiosk and they'll give you an extra 15 minutes to find a nearby station with a dock. Overall, I think the program is very well implemented and gets good maintenance, besides, CitiBike has some of the most fantastic customer service I've come across. They even shipped me a free replacement key when I lost mine, and are extremely courteous with most requests. I highly recommend giving it a shot!PS- a lot of people mention not knowing about the time limits/getting overcharged by CitiBike. In my opinion, CitiBike is extremely clear about the respective time limits and surcharges, and they're not in the business of fooling customers into paying more! :)"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,09/26/2018,"Happy to hear plans for improvement from John.  I think there is still lot of room for improvement.  Here is my assessment of  you (I am a daily user).-  Citibike App . :        A+  (the best out there)- Annual membership cost -  A-  Finding a bike/dock when you need one (busy times)  - F- Dock and bike maintenance            -F(after I report a station problem, seems to take 2 months to fix it)- Latest technology .  :          C .  Pedal assisted bikes are nice, we need more of them.Overall               - CI have added one star :) .   I think they have the same problem as MTA , in the mecca of capitalism NYC they are a monopoly.We need some competition.  Come on NYC,  approve Lime & SPIN.Thanks!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/30/2018,Bike went missing because of a malfunction and they said due to circumstances they would postpone the almost $600 bike replacement fee if I kept my membership active. As soon as I updated my info to keep it active BOOM they still charged me $577 for a piece of crap bike that is somehow missing. And now won't waive the fee whatsoever and it took them more than 25 days to even call back and tell me the can't waive it. TERRIBLE
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/27/2018,"If you are planning on using during commuting hours make sure you test it out first.  I joined two months ago and Iive at CPW and 85th.  There are never any bikes in a 10 block radius.  If you commute during off hours it's amazing.  After signing up i tried to have my membership cancelled because of the lack of bikes and their customer service is the WORST!!!  So it's great for off peak hours...unfortunately, i cannot even use the service."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/21/2018,"Total scam. Charged me an extra $52 because they weren't docked ""fast enough"" every 30 minutes. How is it considered a day pass if you have to run to another docking station every 30 minutes?After calling customer service I received a rude agent who must get these calls everyday asking for their money back. I will never use citi bike again. The bikes are also in horrible shape. Some brake, some don't. Some bells work, some don't. Total scam."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/06/2018,"Annual pass is a fantastic value.   Very easy to start cycling, or to re-start if you haven't been on a bike in years. Smartphone app shows available bikes at the many stations, and then after you check outs a bike, the app shows a map with bike lanes and available bike parking docks giving you lots of choice where to return your bike.   Do not be intimidated by cycling in Manhattan, just try it for a few blocks. Only weakness of CitiBike is it needs to expand to South Bronx up to Yankee Stadium and eastward in Queens to Flushing.    But it is already great in its current service area."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/01/2018,"I usually like Citi bike, great way to get around the city especially the pedal assist.  But the workers for Citi Bike sucks the big one!!!  I walked 10 blocks to get a pedal assist bike saw when the Citi bike worker changed the battery.   Another citi bike worker comes to take the bike worker #1 advised him that he is not suppose to be riding the bikes bc the customers need them. His response was ""watch me""It's already a shortage when it comes to the pedal assist bikes the workers should know this and have some considerations for the people who are looking to use it."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/13/2019,"Sh*tty bike! They're always broken and customer service is non-existent, but sometimes it's the best of bad options. Be better citi bike. I know you wont."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/01/2018,"My girlfriend and I rented bikes for 24 oursWith our fist 3 rides 3 of the 6 bikes we're jacked up in some way (2 didn't shift gears).You also have to wait 2 minutes bo get another one, pretty frustrating"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/05/2018,First time using a citibike - used it to ride from WTC up to the Mega Bus station. I guess because my ride was a little over the half hour limit the charge went from $13 to $26. $26 for a single bike ride is absolutely insane. That is more than my megabus back to Philadelphia.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/21/2018,"Had good experiences over the summer but not yesterday. Got a day pass, ride for 30 minutes and then two hours later got a text that bike was not returned and being charged overages. Called and was told bike hadn't been locked properly. I heard a locking sound and saw red light. Assumed that meant it's locked. Apparently not.  No other warning until that text two hours later. Support said go back to station and put it back in. Went back to docking station, bike is gone. Called support again and found out I could be on the hook for $1200 to replace bike!  Don't forget: they have your credit card and will bill you for some idiot joyriding the bike around. Check reddit, it's even happened to people who did dock correctly."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/20/2018,"Citibike is great under two conditions. 1) you get a bike that actually runs smoothly and 2) there are bikes actually available at the docking stations near you. I started using citibike religiously despite often riding bikes where you had to exert 110% of your energy to barely move. Lately my new issue has been no available bikes. They poorly redistribute bikes in my area and when I reached out I was give a generic response that didn't even address the issues I brought up. If citibike truly wants to hold onto to its customers, they need to more regularly service their bikes and use the data they collect in their app to appropriately distribute bikes in high traffic areas."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,02/18/2018,"While Citi Bike can be a convenient way to get from point A to point B, it is overpriced, and not always available.Citi has nice bikes which ride well and look trendy!However, I can only pay for increments of 24 hours or more. Thus if I just want to ride, say, 10 blocks in one day, I still have to pay a fee or $12 plus a fee (i.e. $13.07). There is no option to ride for, say, only 30 minutes.In terms of local availability, it's nice that there is a bicycle bank on my corner, and in numerous other locations, but there are seldom bikes actually in the bank nearest to my apartment. This can be inconvenient at time.I think this system can be improved by allowing other companies to compete in bike sharing , allowing smaller time periods of rental, and assuring bikes are available more often.Thank you Citi, but there is room for improvement."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/04/2017,Works like any other city bike rental BUT there needs to be more stations..... DC has me spoiled..... why they don't have any at Coney Island is beyond me. Also their day pass for $12.00 bucks as long as you riding the bike checkout within 30 minutes is lame. I'm suppose to enjoy myself not watching a stupid clock and with the stations being far and few in between there is not a guarantee I will find a docking station in time. If you are riding near the water front go for it but I may just bring my own bike the next time I'm in NYC definitely if I am there for the beach.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/30/2018,"These bikes are in really bad shape! This week so far I've rented two damaged ones. Bad wheels, bad coordination and horrible shifts! I don't know how often they perform maintenance on these bikes, but it seems that they are not doing the best job. Looking forward for more bicycle sharing systems in NYC thar are way much better when it comes to the overall operations and maintenance of their main product, a bicycle."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/30/2018,"Was having a great time riding Citi Bike all summer until I ran into a minor issue and was met with the worst customer service of my life. I was charged twice for two rides that, as shown on my app, were both under 30 minutes. Small issue, right? After calling customer service, the lady I spoke to (whose name I will not disclose here) was confused, put me on hold twice, did not know how to use the actual app herself, and then HUNG UP ON ME. TWICE. I can read the billing charges myself and deduce that something is wrong- that's why I called your customer service. Instead of doing anything on the phone, she told me to screenshot and email my issue. OF COURSE I would have done that in the first place had I known an actual human being would not only be useless, but rude!Issue still not resolved and disrespected by a customer service rep. Will NEVER be using CitiBike again and you shouldn't either!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/22/2018,"this is a scam.  start out looking for a dock, then race to find it...too late???   more money. rent from a shop, you get 24 hours, a lock, a map, and a helmet."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/19/2018,It was great riding around nyc for 24hrs for a reasonable price. I had a great time. Every time I seen a spot I got a new ride....Thanks again Citi Bike.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/16/2018,"Excellent for getting around the Queens area. NYC roads need better integration of bike lanes though. Killing off bike lanes abruptly to make room for bus stops and parking spaces makes for dangerous bike commuting. As for the citibike service, removing (or increasing) the 30 minute limit for a rider who has hired for 24 hours would be logical."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/14/2018,Great experience! I wish I could afford a membership cause I really liked the bike. Great on any terrain!
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,01/30/2018,"I wanted to a rent a bike for sightseeing in Central Park and looked up Citi Bike after noticing other people riding them all over NYC. There are stations right by the met, Guggenheim, and Natural History Museum so by the time I was done I had been on a pretty solid bike tour :)I'm now a happy member and feel bad for people that don't get bike share. Four stars for sightseeing on a bike but 5 stars because it helps the environment!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/05/2018,"Citi Bike is a great service to the city and tourists!  We used this system as tourists to sight see and travel the city.  This is the best way to see Manhattan!  At just $12/day pass (which equals 24 hours of biking), it's an incredible deal over renting bikes.  The only catch is you must dock every half hour.  This didn't bother us as we had several destinations where we docked and walked around or ate somewhere.  The bikes are well maintained and the app is simple to use.  You can route a trip using the app's map.  You can adjust the seat easily and the bike comes equipped with a bell, kickstand and many speeds.  NYC has wonderful bike trails like the Hudson River greenway!  Also several streets have dedicated bike lanes either separated from traffic or in the side. Our experience with NYC drivers is that they're mindful of and accustomed to driving with bikers.  I never felt like I was in jeopardy, even though we didn't rent or wear helmets and rode alongside cars on our day trip.  (Citi Bike does not offer helmets- this is okay with me)My only suggestions to Citi Bike:1.  If a docking station is full, allow extra time to get to another station before charging. 2.  Update your app to include the daily history.  I'd love to know how many miles and minutes we biked total."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/09/2018,"Bought an all day pass, it lasted 2 hours... :/ just when we really needed a bike and finally found a station with bikes, are citibike card stopped working. The citibike workers said ""sorry"".  :( ...also, I rented the bike from a citibike worker who told me I would be able to ride the bike as much as I liked during the 24hr period, in 30 minute increments. We used the bikes for a total of 1 hour!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,02/28/2018,The two bikes we rented ran great Plenty of stations to pick up and drop offI just wish you didn't have to Redocked your bike every 30 minutesBest way to get around the city
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,01/06/2018,"Great way to get around Brooklyn (& NYC for that matter).Only hassle would be that the bike stations are limited to Northwest side of Brooklyn so probably not good if you want to bike to Coney Island.I used a Visa credit card and had no hassles.Bike seats and handlebars can be adjusted for height by pulling lever out, then raising/lowering seat, screwing lever to tighten and then closing the lever."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/10/2018,"I love City bikes!!! I use it all the time. I just would love even better if the rides were 45 minutes instead of 30 minutes. It takes me 50 minutes to ride to my job, and It's crazy in NYC to find an spot just to drop your bike off. With traffic and high demand on bikes you gotta be very careful when you are running out of time to drop the bike off. If there's no bikes at your closest drop off location to change bikes it's just hectic."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/11/2018,WARNING!!! YOU WILL BE FINED $1200 if your bike doesn't dock properly (even if you get a light and dock it properly and the dock fails). Just keep this in mind when making your decision - the CitiBike customer service doesn't care what the rationale was for the bike not being returned. You are liable regardless of the reason. Worst customer service ever - filing a police report doesn't help.
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,07/02/2018,"Very good when it works, but they are unhelpful when it does not.  The app failed to unlock a bike multiple times.  The customer service department said there is nothing they could do.  I was stranded without a bike.  Also, they often run out of bikes at key times.Citi bike commented and asked if I had the latest app.  As I mentioned, I spoke to the customer service people several times.  I had the latest app, latest operating system and a new phone.  Unfortunately, the Citi app failed and the customer service people basically said too bad, but there is nothing they could do (politely). It is disappointing when a service fails to perform and the provider makes the consumer suffer.  Sooner or later there will be competition."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/18/2018,"Be advised--seems like a great service until you actually use the bike. I thought using Citi Bike last weekend would be a fun way to see New York City. I purchased a ""day pass"" for $13. Nowhere did it explain to me that the day pass was only good for unlimited 30-minute rides in a 24-hour period. Instead, as seems logical, everything pointed to the idea that I could use the Citi bikes as many times as I liked for 24 hours. Wrong, apparently. For four rides totaling less than four hours, I was charged not just the $13 but an additional $35 in ""overtime fees"" because I kept the bikes out for an hour or 1.5 hours at a time. Citi Bike's ""day pass"" is only good when you ride for 30 minutes, dock the bike, and then get a new bike. If you don't, expect additional fees charged to your credit card automatically. When I called Citi Bike to complain, the agent refused to give me even a partial refund.Owners claim that the signage is clear on this issue. First of all, it's not, as evidenced by this website alone (see numerous additional Yelp reviews in the last year complaining about the same issues). Second, if Citi Bike were actually concerned about its customers misunderstanding pass options, it would indicate on its app when overcharges in the absurd amount of $4/15 minutes were being invoked, so that riders could dock the bikes immediately. Seems to me like a clear profiteering scheme. I will never use Citi Bike again. Buyer beware."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,11/23/2016,"Got a day pass from the Citi Bike app, and checked out my first bike here at Central Park South in front of a fancy hotel. As of my trip, a day pass was $12, and you got 30 minutes of riding time, before you get charged an additional $4/15 min. Make your trips short, and plan with the app. The bikes were mostly semi-workable. I checked out a total of 9 bikes, the majority of them had some sort of shifting problem. One had brakes that would stick, and make you feel like you're pedaling the Alps. The bikes are a bit on the heavy side, but they're sturdy and comfortable with wide, adjustable seats, and a bell to alert pedestrians that you're coming through. Move it or lose it! The app makes the whole experience much better. It shows you where you are, where the nearest stations are, etc. Gotta get the app."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/01/2018,Fun to use and convenient.  We rode for about 3 miles but I can see myself going a lot further and seeing more of the city.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/03/2018,"Very convenient and easy to use. I also really liked that the total time, distance, and calories burned were tracked!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/12/2018,"My ass hurts on the seats while riding the bike. It needs softer cushion. I hate riding in the streets when the lanes run out. I get anxiety thinking I may get hit in the street by a bus, riding with the traffic. I almost cussed this nosey lady out for thinking she could question my ability to even afford to ride the bike for f*cks sake. My friend and I had a blast roaming NYC late at night together. Quite an adventure. I missed bike riding since I was a kid. And our upper leg quads were in pain but a good kind of pain. Viva la NYC. I love citibike!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/03/2018,"BEWARE!!! RIPOFF!!! I signed up for a ""Day Pass"" for $13.00 for a crappy three speed lunker that weighs a ton and has terrible brakes, I thought that was a little expensive, but I splurged to go for a ride for an hour.  MY BILL WAS $75!!!  Yes, the ""Day Pass"" is no such thing.  That ""Day Pass"" just allows you to unlock the bike and ride 30 minutes -- and then they charge you about $4 every 15 MINUTES for use after that!!!  YIKES!!  What sense does that make?  I rode from Brooklyn to SoHo and docked my bike with a very forceful, loud, deliberate shove.  Turns out, even though I rammed it into the docking station, it didn't dock.  Because it didn't dock, the charges kept running.  An hour later, I receive an email that I am racking up charges at $4 every 15 minutes.  That's when I first realized Citi Bikes charges a small fortune every quarter hour, not $13/day.  I call, and in a frustrating help conversation, am told I have to go back and re-dock--all the while I am accruing charges more than of $16/hour.  If I don't, they'll charge me $400 for a lost bike!!!!  No Bull!!!  I eventually take a subway downtown from Central Park back to SoHo to re-dock, and by then they bill me for $75!!!!   Lots of other reviewers have had the same unfortunate experience.Do you know what a great racing bike you can rent for $75/day?  I do--a $4000 Specialized, Trek or Cannondale with carbon frame and Shimano Ultegra components, plus shoes and a helmet and tools.  For a whole day, not just a few hours.  Fortunately, my card had expired, otherwise I would have been forced to pursue credit card dispute resolution for deceptive billing practices.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK -- THERE IS NO DAY PASS!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/11/2018,"First time using CitiBike, and had the BEST day with it. So easy to use, very cost friendly, and fun! Rode around Manhattan and Brooklyn!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/04/2018,It was very convenient. The inly problem is at one station there were only three bikes and I couldn't adjust the seat because it was stuck so I had to walk a few blocks to another station to get a bike.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/18/2017,"This is a review of my annual membership. I joined as soon as they expanded to my neighborhood 2 years ago, as a station opened right across the street from me! I used citibike frequently, and for the low cost to be a member it was totes worth it. I'm interested in joining again now that they're expanding even deeper into Brooklyn. The bikes were generally well-maintained, and not a ton of issues finding an empty dock to park it. But taking away a star because there were times either no bikes were available when the app said there was or all docks were full, the latter which made it inefficient for a work commute. So I could only use it when I wasn't under strict time constraints.I agree with day pass users that 30 minutes is not adequate. Members get 45, so that was a sufficient amount of time for me. But perhaps they can extend day pass use to 45 and member usage to an hour. When I used citibike for the very first time on a day pass, it was clear to me that there was a refundable deposit and a 30 minute rule, so not quite sure what other people are seeing. But if these many people are having issues, the company may want to make it clearer."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/01/2017,I will never ever rent a bike from this company again. I was charged a late fee that cost more than what I signed up for.  Very misleading. Customer service is nonexistent.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/15/2018,"The past few weeks experiences with this company have lead to me feeling like I need to share and review. CitiBike was a great idea. My husband and I live in midtown and decided to each get the yearly subscription and have Citibike be our main form of transportation within Manhattan. This was our choice and has ended up, in hindsight, our huge mistake. There are NEVER any bikes available. We have about 6+ docks around our neighbourhood and no matter if it is a weekday (and I'm talking any time of day, not specifically peak hour) or weekends, there are generally, like 90% of the time, no bikes. There's often 2 at the dock but they're always ones that don't work. I've missed multiple important events, meetings, classes, interviews etc. Despite giving myself extra time and factoring in having to hunt for a bike. This afternoon, there was 1 single bike left at one single dock near me. I couldn't get it out with my app code, or with my credit card at the kiosk. After spending way too long on the phone with CitiBike Support, I was just told they couldn't help and to find another bike...there were no other bikes within walking distance...and, I missed my meeting. I get it, getting the Citibike subscription was a choice. But, after paying for a yearly subscription and continual disappointments and a request for a refund which was denied and the only thing I seem to be getting from the customer service reps is ""We will submit your complaint. ""There's nothing else we can do. "". Do these complaints actually get submitted? I'm unsure as there seems to have been no change over the months to the distribution and relocation of the bikes which Citibike keeps promising. The only thing I can think to do is let other people know the deal before they fork out the cash. Citibike maybe a great idea if you want a leisurely tourist-like bike ride along the Hudson on a brisk Fall Sunday with no time constraints and the willingness to walk and wait and hunt down a bike.  If so, it's totally worth your time and money. But, honestly, the thing it was designed for...a mode of transport for residents of the city...it fails at. Greatly. It does not provide reliable transportation. It's continually a gamble and more often than not, the customer ends up the loser. The missed and now rescheduled meeting from today is probably going to be detrimental to my future work. Save yourself the money, the time, the stress of always being late (or not even showing up at all) and use the not always reliable MTA...that way more reliable (yep, I'm saying this) than Citibike."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/17/2018,Worst experience. Overpriced service with hidden fees.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/25/2018,"A good idea in theory, with terrible execution.I've been an annual subscriber for a couple years, but this is the end. I'm cancelling my account, and my wife is cancelling her account. Telling my family to follow suit.The bikes have been falling into disrepair and the problem continues to get worse. Most of the time, there are no bikes when I need them to get to work and no bikes when I need them to get home from work. They do a poor job of moving the bikes to empty racks, so most of the time especially during rush hours, the service is useless.Finally tonight, the last straw. I was lucky enough to actually get a bike today. I docked the bike where I always dock it and the bike got stuck in the dock. Now tonight I get home and I check the app and it says I've had the bike for 10 hours. I call customer service they want to claim I stole their precious bike and ""there's nothing we can do"". So I go back over there in the middle of the night (I should be in bed, I work for a living) and sure enough the bike is still there. Sitting in their broken and powerless dock. I call customer service again, and so now they are ""escalating"" it, whatever that means. I'm done. Worst service ever. Buy your own bike, before they slap $1200 stolen bike fees on your credit card. $1200 for these pieces of rusty disgusting garbage. I wouldn't pay $12 for one of these.And to make matters worse, they raise the price on you every year!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/07/2018,"Had a great time! Although there are many docks available throughout the city, be aware of time if you're renting for a day since some docks will be full. It's a heavy bike so I wouldn't recommend it for the street if you aren't street savvy. Enjoy a casual bike ride."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/03/2017,"UPDATE! Woke up to find I am being charged more than $30 for what I thought was $12 for Day Pass for 24 hour rental....Omfg...I could have bought an unlimited Metro card for that!!!! ---- Original Review-----Love love these clunky lil blue bikes!! They are not super hi tech hybrid bikes, just so perfect for cruising around. I decided against trying to get to 3 different places in an afternoon by train, and Citi Bike just happened to be right there -- problem solved. October in NYC, in a tshirt, riding a bike around Queens, yes, please! I recommend you eye your bike up and down before unhooking it, and check that it has a rear mud flap! If you do a day pass, currently $12, you can dock your bike and then get another anytime during you 24-hr period which means you don't need to lug it up the stairs into your apartment. They could do a better job of explaining this feature (dock and undock multiple times) bc it is a big reason to rent and ride.I recommend the Citi Bikes 100%!! Enjoy your lil bluet!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/08/2018,First time user. As an avid road cyclist used to skinny tire bikes I found the bikes comfortable and easy to use. We went 7 miles around nyc on bike paths and it's the only way to get around.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/30/2016,"I got a free day pass, so my boyfriend and I biked to Brooklyn, switched out bikes, walked around, got a new bike, went to brunch and it was a blast! The process was easy and efficient and the directions for using my pass were easy to follow. I wish the time limit was longer; it was only 30 minutes, but I know Citi Bike is usually 45 minutes anyway. I'm excited for the next time we use Citi Bike!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/02/2018,"Most fun I've had in NYC riding through the city! So exhilarating, will definitely do it again."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/11/2016,"I didn't pick up from this location, but this was the only page on yelp? Anyway, I thought the bikes were great for short rides under 2 miles. There are a surprisingly large amount of bike lanes in nyc. More than I thought. I used the app to find the docking stations and paths. It was fun and made me feel like a real new yorker. I had to check my phone at every light to make sure I was going the right way, but nobody has to know that. Odd thing was I got asked for directions twice while I was on the bike. I was like uhm I'm on a bike, can't stop to give you directions and also I don't know where I'm going. :P I've used these shared bikes once before in London and it was terrible. I remember it being really hard to take off the dock and put back in, but these were really easy. Maybe because I've been working out hah. I didn't have any issues with the code or docking. I had to adjust the seats, but it was easy. The one downside is the handlebars were all super sticky. ew. The bikes are obviously also meant for short distance commuting. They're quite clunky and slow, but that's why I said 2 miles max, maybe 3. It is kind of like riding a tank - you can ride over almost anything. Nice to not have to worry about the tires getting a flat.It's also $12 for a day pass. That's rather expensive. Much more than the subway. I was in it for the scenery and to say I rode a bike around new york."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/22/2018,This was my 2nd experience with citi bike but 1st time actually riding the bike and it was smooth sailing. I originally thought it might be a lil complicated to rent the bike but it wasn't and I was able to get to my destination in no time. The bike are a bit heavier in comparecen to my own bike but that's all about self adjusting so no biggie. Totally recommend if your using it for a quite ride. If your trying to used the bike all day it might get a little overbearing to have to check in you bike every 30 min. That my experience with a 24. Hour rental.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/01/2016,"Fantastic service for short bike rides or errands. We decided to take a bike ride on a Sunday early eve, and while my son has his own bike I do not so this was wonderful.We did not have time limitations or need to get another bike so we didn't have an issue with bike docking stations being empty etc. However given you can't ride a long stretch going downtown on the east river I think the west side or Central Park biking is probably better for that or for tourists. I was not comfortable allowing my son to ride in the bike lanes on the streets but still we had a nice bike ride and I definitely plan to use this service again. Despite as my son pointed out some elderly looking at us like we were walking camels across the upper east side streets my son and I both loved the bike ride."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/27/2018,"As a yearly membership rider in Manhattan, I love it and hate it. When everything works as it's supposed to it's a fantastic service. More often than not, however, the docks are broken, or the bikes need maintenance. The docking device is a nightmare: very touchy devices. 30% of the time the dock won't accept the bike no matter how many techniques you use. No wonder you see so many people SLAMMING the bikes into the docks. The docks don't recognize or accept my card half the time...light turns red instead of green.  Distribution of bikes is really bad...not nearly enough of them in the most popular stations.  Like New York itself, the equipment is in disrepair, dirty, run-down...and the service/reliability is spotty.  I only wish I had an option. I'd switch to the competition."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/04/2018,"Citi bike has unacceptable customer service. Accused my little brother of being a liar when we had 4 witnesses. Who cares tho, the bank sided with my brother."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/13/2016,"For us, using the Citi Bike bike sharing scheme was a learn-as-you-go process.A few things: *adhere to 30 minute limit per bike ride (dock your bike, and if you like it, wait two mintues & re-rent it, or grab another one), or risk incurring a 'late' fee*wait for the wee green light to flash on docking bay before pulling out your bike (I found grabbing the back of the bike seat, lifting up and out to be most successful)*try to snag a newer bike (easily ID'ed by bike light on the back fender) as those tend to be in better nick & have a more 'user friendly' gear shifter*docking stations in commuter areas may be devoid of bikes at prime commute times*download Citi Bike app in order to find the nearest docking station near you*use the Citi Bike app to rent a bike remotely, so that you can just rock up to a docking station, grab a bike & goWe did not run out of bike paths/lanes to use as many Manhattan avenues now have dedicated bike lanes for you to cruise in relative safety along. We also availed ourselves of the Hudson River Greenway and the path along the East River with our Citi Bikes. Time it out right, and one is able to find a docking station within the 30 minute time frame. This takes a bit of planning, but is not impossible to achieve. Among the areas accessible to us via Citibike were Midtown, SoHo, W. Village, E. Village, Hell's Kitchen, the UWS, the South Ferry area, and Chelsea. I have to say that not always needing to rely on the bus and subway during our stay was a treat."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/04/2016,"***NOTE - these are NOT FOR TOURISTS! Unlike other major cities - this is a bike sharing program for residents. BEWARE- Using bikes for more than 30 minutes results in A HUGE overage charge. We went to a kiosk at Central Park, read the instructions, popped in our credit card and assumed our charge would be about $50. My credit card bill arrived with $80 in overages AND a miscalculated time amount for one of the three bikes - which we used simultaneously. Citi ought to be ashamed. There is one vague line on the kiosk about the 30 minute limit - which clearly lacks details. So, buyer beware.  I just called and - after complaining long enough - I was finally told I could submit a claim for a refund - which I did receive promptly."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/25/2017,"Five stars all the way -- for the simple fact that I think bike sharing programs should be in every neighborhood in every country in the world.Things I love:1.) The app. It's the greatest. Find a bike near you and find an open dock near your destination. Can't get much better than that. Also, it keeps track of your usage time so you'll know when you need to find a dock ASAP to avoid extra charges. I also love that it keeps track of the miles biked and calories burned. I always feel so good about my ride after.2.) Biking around a city really allows you to see it from a different angle. I normally avoid Times Square at all costs, but riding through it at 3 a.m. on a warm summer night is just magical.3.) You don't have to worry about investing in an expensive lock and praying that someone doesn't break it anyway and steal your bike.4.) You can have a bike at (almost) anytime and (almost) anywhere you want/need it.5.) MUCH faster than walking6.) You don't have to store your bike in your tiny Manhattan apartment (which I did for many years in my 250 sq. ft. studio, before Citibike came into existence)7.) You don't have to pay to store your bike somewhere if you don't have room in your apartment8.) Much better exercise than standing/sitting on the subway or in the back of a car share9.) SO MUCH FREEDOM. Need to go cross-town? Just a few blocks? Across a bridge? Want a romantic nighttime ride through Central Park? A sunny afternoon along the Hudson River? Do it all. It's all glorious.10.) No fuel required.11.) No exhaust.12.) Cost-effective vs. subway/cabNo matter how in love I am with bike share programs, improvements can always be made.Some suggestions:1.) There needs to be more stations and more bikes. By now, Citibike folks should know the flow of riders around the city and understand where more docks and bikes are needed -- especially for the commuter flow of downtown vs uptown.2.) Simply, not having stations/bikes above 110th Street in Manhattan or anywhere in the Bronx at all is just...well...not very inclusive. If you can move across the Hudson to Jersey City and Hoboken, you can cross the uptown threshold of Manhattan.3.) While you're at it, expand above Hoboken as well. The river towns in Jersey are thirsty for something like this.4.) While I've seen infrastructure for cycling greatly increase over the past decade in New York, there still is a lot more to be done. More protected bike lanes are a must. Driver/pedestrian/cycling safety classes -- or at the very least, information in the form of campaign ads near docking stations or on social media -- should be readily available. The amount of motorists and pedestrians who don't pay attention and put cyclists' lives in danger is astounding. I would say I nearly get hit by a car at least once every time I ride, while in a bike lane. That should not happen.5.) Please tend to broken bikes faster. There's nothing more annoying that needing a bike and seeing a rack with 4 of them that are not in use because something is wrong with them -- and having to wait 15 minutes for another biker to come and dock a good one.6.) Consider adding some feature to the app that would calculate how much energy is saved (electricity and/or oil/gas usage and emissions) per ride, like you do with the miles biked/calories burned. It would be great to track how much biking is helping the earth -- and I would think it would be a great use as a marketing tactic on your end to entice more ridership and to get more bikes on the roads!7.) Perhaps add a map feature to the app so you can map your ride before you take off -- and so you can more easily find the closest available docking station. Would be great if it could update in real time so a biker doesn't get stuck heading toward a station that has become full since the trip began.8.) Make day passes cheaper and have weekly passes as well. For the price of the 3-day Citibike pass, I got a full week of unlimited bike share in Paris.As you can tell, I think a lot about bike share programs. On a trip to Paris two years ago, my partner and I used only their bike share (called Velib) to get around Paris. No cabs, no subways (only bus rides to/from the airport). Transit is usually not an attraction on a trip but this was the best experience we ever had. We got to see so much more of Paris than we would have if we were underground or just in the back of a cab and got to know Paris intimately and for a fraction of the cost of what other transit options were available. I remember how controversial Citibike was in the years it was in its planning stages and when it was first implemented. But I am grateful for the folks and activists who pushed through and made this happen. After seeing so many European cities that heavily rely on bicycle travel, and how effective it is on so many levels, it's a no-brainer that it can be that way here, too. Biking is the future!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/17/2018,Good experience for exploring neighborhood by Citi Bike. Perfect stations locations. Good solution for ride road plan.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/27/2018,Love the Citi bikes! Great for getting around the city! Only downside is not enough bike Lanes!
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,02/22/2018,"Amazing! Easy to use machines. Gets you around the city quickly. Fair price ($12/24hours). Great for nice, warm days in NYC Like yesterday (02/21/18, 70+ degrees in the day time). Only wish the amount of time between the required docking was longer (it's currently 30 or 45 minutes between docking, depending on if you have an account and your membership type. The $12/24 hours mentioned earlier is the ""non-membership option. There is also a 3-day option for non-members). Also, it would've been great to have more docks near Manhattan's water fronts. I was riding along the Hudson (west side) and might have enjoyed that a little more if I had been able to stop and take in the view. I was terrified of overage charges."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/21/2018,"I've used Citi Bike often around Brooklyn with no major issues.  But what a nightmare using it in Manhattan.   I spent 30 minutes looking for a bike station in Midtown and Chelsea that had available bikes, and it wasn't until I literally caught up with the Citi repair truck that was unloading new bikes that I finally was able to rent one.  And when I tried to return it in the Lower East Side I spent another 20 minutes going to FOUR stations looking for an open bike dock. Which ironically again was the result of catching up with the repair truck that was TAKING bikes out of the docks for tuneups. And at least 3 of the stations' credit card scanners in Manhattan wouldn't even read my credit card, which is a new card. The night culminated with the final blow, a station full of bikes gave me a message on the kiosk saying ""We apologize, rentals are not available at the moment."" Extremely frustrating series of events for a company as ""reputable"" as Citi. All in all I wasted about 45 minutes throughout the day going from station to station trying to find either A) an available bike, B) an open dock, or C) a scanner that would actually read my card.  Citi Bike offers a measly $6 coupon for customers who did not have a great experience, but an actual refund would be more on par with the level of Customer Service they claim to have.  I don't recommend wasting your $12 on this frustrating experience."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/10/2017,Some of the bikes are really hard in operating.Stations are always empty in a lunch time.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/12/2018,"This company completely ruined mine and my husband's wedding anniversary. We planned to rent bikes for the day and head to Central Park for a romantic picnic that we had reserved and already paid for. We were at the rental docking station. I entered my password. It didn't unlock my bike. Instead it unlocked someone else's bike. We called customer service and were told we were stuck. I couldn't get a bike until mine was returned. I was financially responsible if it was returned late or not at all. We missed our picnic, had to pay for an Uber on top of all charges being assessed by the person who got my bike at my expense. In all, instead of making our lives easier, citi bike ruined what was supposed to be an amazing anniversary date in which my husband wanted to romantically re propose to me."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,11/17/2014,"So I was thinking of renting a bike....then thought it was going to be too cold.  Then came to town and saw the citibikes eeeeeverywhere.  Both the docking station and the bikes.  And then the green bike lanes.  Ooh, I had to try them out.To start the process...you use your credit card and theres a number of disclaimers, questions, etc you go through on a computer screen.  I was really totally only looking to ride them once or twice so I settled on the one day $9.95 pass.To me, the system is a little confusing, and i feel theres a little bit of ""buyer beware"" to be ""aware"" of.  There's a $101 (or $105? Something like that) hold put on your card automatically (they tell you this-- but still.) You get a code and have five minutes to use the code on the bike of ur choice.  I fully realize i may**occasionally** be technologically deficient but I felt it was a little hard to figure all this out quickly.  There's obviously no one at these kiosks so i was on my own trying to unlock the bike.The ride:  i checked the air pressure on a few bikes before i chose one and overall it was ok.  Personally I'm used to leaning over to reach the handle bars on a bike-not sitting upright so the whole balancing and turning felt a little awkward to me.  The brakes felt like they could use tightening and as I road the front tire made a noise like a frog every couple seconds:(.  But it was ok for my purposes.However...30 minutes go really quick, and I soon found myself concerned about time.  You have  to return each bike every 30 min (God, I think -- so many rules.) Could they make it every 60 minutes you have to return them? Oy! 30 min is NOT much time to ride.Returning the bike was a little awkward... it was locked but took a minute and honestly the process made me a little nervous.Its very likely that this is one of those things you have to do a bunch of times to get the hang of.  For me, it was less expensive and more convenient than trying to go to a place (store) that rents out bikes, so I'm sure it seems like I'm complaining about a lot of the aspects of citi bikes.  Still, it seems like there's room for improvement."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/05/2018,"First time using it. It's an easy service to use, and I appreciate not having to worry about locking up my bike."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/07/2018,We rented 2 bikes for 24 hours at what we thought was $12 per bike per day and they ended up charging us $82. What they don't tell you is that you have to return the bike every 30 minutes. Why have 24 hour rentals if that is the case? I won't ever be using this service again.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/04/2018,Love it!!! Such a great way to see the city AND so much faster (and cheaper then a cab) when public transport isn't in the right spot. So many convenient locations to drop off the bike when you're done !!! Definitely buying an annual membership.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/22/2016,My friend rent the bike from the street shop for 20$ for 7 hours ( which is Ok) But on the end it was always nose to goooo back all the way to take his bike whenever we where stoping somewhere to take a walk)Citybank - mobilebike!!)
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,02/09/2016,"I was an inaugural member, and I also signed up for a second year just to support the service.I gave it up eventually since I didn't have a need for it. That second year, I think I only used it less than 10 times since I was staffed on projects that were directly next to subway entrances.It's awesome when it works, but getting a bike and finding an open dock is a very frustrating experience if you work in one of the popular areas like Midtown.  I hope the service gets better, but I won't be renewing my membership again."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/22/2018,"It's a great system, I just wish we didn't have to dock them in certain places. Something I have to walk around to find a dock to return it."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,01/20/2018,It is a brilliant way to get around NYC and so much fun! Bikes are in a very good condition and easy to navigate. The app is extremely helpful to locate the available bikes and docks.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/09/2018,"My friends and I decided to citibike across town through Central Park on a whim and had an absolute blast. We had initially planned to just cross the park on bikes because it was faster than waiting for he cross town bus, but then had so much fun we decided to take an extended ride back through Central Park. The bikes were easy to rent, use, and dock. I highly recommend this for your next Sunday fun day adventure :)"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/06/2018,My experience with Citi Bike was great! I rode around the city for hours! The text letting me know how much time I had left was very helpful. I definitely would recommend city bike to my friends as Different way to get around the city.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/03/2017,"DO NOT USE SO BAD, SO UNACCOMMODATING SO RUDE AWFUL PEOPLE DO NOT USE.The worst possible experience you can imagine. DO NOT USE CITI BIKE. These people are nasty and extremely unaccommodating. We used Citi Bike for the first time this weekend and thought we docked the bikes in the way we were supposed to, then got a late fee because apparently we did not dock the bikes correctly. We checked, the bikes were still there and there was a problem with the system. The customer service on the phone was SO RUDE AND SO BAD, and did not offer help. This is THE WORST organization. For an organization that louds itself on affordable public transit this was a disgusting abuse. DO NOT USE CITIBIKE THEY ARE AWFUL"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/22/2018,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE & UNFAIR BUSINESS MODELFirst off, 30 minutes per trip is way too short. If I pay for a day pass than I should be able to keep a bike out for the whole day if I want. Especially if I get unlimited rides for free. It was a pain and completely pointless to keep docking every 30 minutes only to take a new bike out each time.Second, one of the times that I docked a bike, it gave me the green light saying that I had docked it properly but my app said that I was still out on a ride. I triple checked the dock and even had someone else ensure that it was locked in there. The app says that if I have trouble like this to call customer support. Note that, I can't take a new bike out or do anything until the trip ends. So I was forced to call only to find out that no one is available and I had to leave a message. I tried again several times until I got someone who was awful. She said that no one could come out and look at the dock and would not believe me when I told her that I swore the bike was locked. She wouldn't help me until I went back and double check the dock. Even more insane logic, she was going to hang up and have me call back after I checked it again - why not just believe me then?! So instead, I made her stay on the line. I wasn't about to wait 20 min to get her back on the phone or repeat the process with  someone else - surprise surprise, when I checked it again, it was locked. For all she knew I could have been pretending to check it. She should have believed me when I said I was sure - I also had a witness vouch for me. If they don't commission people to pop round and help you in person then they need to be more believing of the customer. It's not my fault their dock didn't notify the app. After an hour of convincing her, I was FINALLY free to resume my trip. Thankfully I was out got a leisurely ride but what if I legit had to be somewhere?!Then, I got an email 3 hours later saying that my trip was still open and that I might get charged. I emailed them back asking if this was still a problem bc I had spoken to someone on the phone and they said they resolved it. They took care of this as well but still very frustrating.I will not be using citibike again if this is the type of customer service I have to deal with when something goes wrong."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/26/2018,I LOVE CITI BIKE! I bought a day pass to explore Brooklyn and it made my day perfect! So easy to use! Will definitely recommend to friends!
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/30/2018,I hadn't ridden a bike in 7yrs and yesterday I rode around all of Central Park with my 6yo and we had so much fun!!!! I can't wait to do it more in the next coming good weather!!!
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/29/2018,"Like every bikeshare system, it isn't without its problems - but overall the Citi Bike system is well run (especially considering how extensive the network is) and most bikes tend to be in reasonable shape"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/01/2017,"I love the idea of bike sharing but their implementation is terrible and borderline criminal.  You have to check the bikes in every 30 minutes or they start charging you $16 an hour (on top of the pass price). This adds a totally unnecessary element of stress and urgency. If you (inevitably) don't click the bike all the way into the station, they continue charging you indefinitely. Customer service is totally unhelpful and expects you to travel across the city to find their bike in the middle of the night??!!! I'm pretty sure they make most of their money off of this kind of credit card company-esque bullshit. AVOID."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/28/2017,Wonderful ride from Williamsburg to DUMBO to Brooklyn Bridge! Got the 24 hr pass and there were many stations along the way. At some point we had to call customer service and they were very speedy to answer and help out.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/18/2018,It would be great if there were bikes available. At 6am you would think there are tons of bikes outside the penn station area. But not one available. I walked 1/2 way to work before I finding  an available bike. Waist of money for me.
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/21/2017,"Having to dock the bike every 30 minutes is beyond annoying. What's a day pass if you can't have it for a whole day? Having to stop and dock it makes your travel time longer and you're constantly worried you're going to go over time. The bikes also only have 3 levels of resistance and even the highest one doesn't have enough, so if you're going up a hill you really have to pedal. I know these aren't top notch bikes but they should consider upgrading in the future. They should also try and get bikes that are lighter, these are pretty clunky and heavy. Also not sure why they think that basket thing in the front is useful. Just have a normal basket! We actually can't put anything in there. There's also no water bottle holder which is such a simple thing....the concept is great but these little things make the process so annoying."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,09/01/2017,Bikes are in good shape. The app could be better but is adequate to make service work.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/30/2016,"Unlimited 30 minute rides for 24 hrs is NOT CLEAR. So it is expected of me to inconveniently go off route, search for a kiosk to dock the bike, then un-dock to go back to riding. I would need to time my rides and take out my cell phone to find the nearest kiosk???? Regardless if there are thousands of kiosks, it is still inconvenient for a program that praises itself in being ""convenient."" This may have made perfect sense for a regular New Yorker in ""the know"", but I was a visitor who simply wanted to enjoy a nice ride along the Hudson River. This trip turned out to be a $50 trip for something I thought would only be $12. BULLSHITCiti Bike should waive the overage fee for first time ignorant customers AT LEAST, that's good business. Not just say ""our fine print says... blah blah screw you too."" I will be sure to NOT recommend anyone to Citi Bike, but just take a damn uber."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/04/2017,"What a racket. They charged me an extra 17 bucks so I could do tem a favor and take the bike to an empty location went the place I went to take it back was full and so was the next one. Ended up paying the price of an unlimited metrocard 7 day pass for 2 45 minute bike rides. Not worth it. No text about it being late, nothing. Greedy. Should have know by something run by Citi bank, they make all their money on late fees just like a bank."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/08/2016,"Having lived in Midtown right by a subway for the last few years, I had no real need for a Citi Bike annual pass. But having recently moved apartment to the Lower East Side, a good 10 minute walk to the subway, I thought it would be the ideal time to give it a whirl. After receiving a promotional offer for a $25 discount, I finally took the plunge. What a huge disappointment. Theoretically, it's a great idea. But two weeks after receiving my key I have yet to find an available bike at the THREE docking stations near me even ONCE in the morning. I live on the corner of Ave D and Houston - there is a docking station at Ave C which is always empty except for this one broken bike which always seems to be there. So then I walk a block to Avenue B and similarly, the docking station is always empty in the morning. I've tried at 7:30am, 8am, 9am - no difference. There is NEVER a bike there. A couple of times I have been so determined to use the service I paid for that I even walked over to Rivington St to try the docking station there - same thing, completely empty! So what exactly did I pay for? Oh there are bikes there in the early evening when people cycle back with them on their way home from work. But never when you really need them, in the morning for your daily commute. Three years into the service, Citi Bike have completely and utterly failed to address the problem of poor bike distribution. I remember this being a common complaint when it first started, and remember hearing them promise to address the issue by moving bikes around the stations. They are NOT doing this at my location and it's rendered my $130 pass all but useless. I have never once seen the Citi Bike truck unloading bikes into the Avenue C station. Yesterday I spoke to a guy in my new building who says that he can count on one hand the number of times he's found an available bike in the morning in one year of membership. So what gives? It appears that despite all the complaints, Citi Bike is not competent enough to manage the operation. A competent operation would involve identifying high traffic areas which are always short of bikes - stations which are far away from a subway station for instance - and making sure that bikes are distributed among them evenly throughout the day. But a simple concept like this is evidently too much trouble and/or too complicated for Citi Bike, whose specialty seems to be limited to charging credit cards and ignoring complaints. But it's not just the complete lack of available bikes. There are other things - for instance many of their bikes have rubber handlebars which are so sticky and disgusting you feel like dunking your hand in hydrogen peroxide after touching them. I've managed to get a bike three times now - never in my neighborhood - and each time, the handlebars were disgusting. And then there's the app. I don't enable GPS on my phone and have no desire to use the GPS function of the app. Despite this, every time I open the app I have to dismiss warnings telling me that I don't have GPS turned on. This is just poor design - a well designed app would give the user a preference setting to allow them to disable the GPS locator if they wish. Bike sharing is an excellent idea and I've experienced it working PROPERLY in another country. Like most things in New York though, this just suffers from a general culture of incompetence and bad design. Just like the subway. If you're thinking about shelling out the money for an annual membership, please think twice. If I can make one person decide against paying for this awful service then typing all of this out will have been worth it.EDIT: I added a photo to illustrate the inexcusable situation with bike stations in the East Village. This screenshot was taken just after noon on a Tuesday. As you can see there are no bikes anywhere, it's just empty station after empty station. Absolutely no attempt is being made to distribute bikes to make them available in this neighborhood, and the situation is the same every day. If Citi Bike thinks this is acceptable then I believe the city of New York should take away their right to run this system and give someone else a go. I can't believe I paid $130 to have no bikes available for most of the day."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/05/2016,"Very upset I paid for a year membership. These bikes are simply too heavy for me to use. At 45lbs, unless you are fairly fit/strong to begin with, be ready to spend half your ride walking these heavy bikes any time you have to go up hill. Theoretically, I should be able to get this bike up a hill, in reality because there are so many other people on the roads/paths I cannot keep up my momentum- I have tried every gear- 3 is impossible, 2 just spins without catching, and 1 is a joke. On top of being a nightmare on any slight up hill that has other bikers/pedestrians, the availability is very poor. I usually spend 20 minutes running around trying to find a station both when picking up and returning the bikes. I'm adding one star because my husband loves them, but he is able to take advantage of them on weekdays when the paths are less busy, and he is much physically stronger than I am. I'm so sad to make this review, because I wanted so badly to live citi bike as well!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/18/2017,"I've used citibike for years.. almost as soon as they opened.  To date, I've logged over 650 miles, 400 + miles and dropped 30 thousand calories.  I live in a doorman building, so I don't always have my keys on me.  Recently Citibike accused me of sharing my membership with others.. and deactivated the feature that allows me to log in using my credit card instead of bike token.  I find this extremely annoying as I live a very active lifestyle, have been a massive proponent of Citibike, and do not share my account!  Why would I ever give someone my credit card or bike token?!  That's insane.  I'm beyond annoyed with Citibike.  Thanks for being a crappy partner."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/07/2018,"Living on the Upper East Side and having to rely on taxis or the 6 to get to and from work isn't always ideal. Citi Bike is a nice third option that gets me where I need to be in half the time of the subway and about equal to that if I were in a car (during rush hour). Bikes are usually easy to find and in good condition, plus the light and bell are a nice addition for night travel (although I hate how many time I accidentally ring the bell). All in all, not asking for a lot out of Citi Bike, but I am always happy with the service I receive."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/05/2018,I had a Citibike membership last year and am considering renewal this year. I did not have any significant problems finding or docking bikes. My complaint is that the membership options are limited. Citibike should offer a month-to-month membership option rather than the current monthly payment option that requires a full year commitment. I would be more inclined to join if I could opt in as needed rather than paying $169/year with the limit of 45 minute rides.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/04/2017,I love biking and was very excited to be able to grab a bike and ride through Central Park. I got a day pass for $12 and downloaded the app. This would be a great deal if you didn't have to return your bike every 30 minutes to avoid overage fees. Watching the time as you bike takes away from the experience in a major way. It stressed me out! I went over the time by 1 minutes and 3 seconds for one of my rides and was charged $4 for that. I even contacted customer service to see if they might give me a pass on that minute since it was my first ever ride with them. But they shut me down. I am very disappointed.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,11/03/2017,I had an incredible experience. The parking situation was simple and convenient. The bikes were also good quality bikes. Very comfortable.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/24/2016,"Absolute scam. They are so desperate for cash that they will do anything to collect money off your credit card. We took out two bikes for a 20 block ride, docked and headed into a store. When we came out we couldn't get our code to work and tried multiple stations with no luck. Already pissed I paid $24 and couldn't actually use the bike I hiked home 30 blocks with a dead cell phone. When I called them to ask for a refund they said I also had an additional $90 charge for 'overtime' and refused to refund either charges.  I had apparantly docked improperly but had received no calls, no texts, nothing. The representative said that she could see that I had 'improperly docked', coincidently BOTH bikes. 1. What are the chances we both docked improperly?2. Why do I get texts that tell me when I dock properly but not improperly? 3. I jammed the bike into the docking station and there was no getting it out. I do not even believe it was not locked in, it obviously just did not register.Don't even waste your time, a cab that would have cost  $5 cost me over $100 because Citi bikes are an absolute scam with poor customer service. I'm disputing the charge with my credit card company, I am absolutely not paying it."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/27/2018,Well situated on the east side downtown to midtown. Bikes more decent for city travel than they appear
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/14/2018,"Citi Bikes are a good way to experience the city.  However, having to redock the bike every 30 mins is a joke and just a way to make money.  I paid for two day passes, which should have amounted to around $24-25 total. Instead, I ended up paying $60.00 due to keep the bike out longer than 30 mins per ride. They will try and say they make it clear, but they don't, and it's just another way to make money.  It's just a crappy way to do business but I suppose they're around to make money."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,12/05/2013,I have seen this kind of bike rental in Europe all the time. Seeing in NY city.... bright blue color bikes.... get my attention right away!I try to look at the rental machine.... VERY COMPLICATED & CONFUSING!!! So not user friendly...... It is a great idea to commute in the city by bikes but seeing so many bikes parking there... make me wonder maybe the price or the operation is not so efficient that is why people don't utilize it.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/23/2018,"Great first time experience!! Bike worked, the code to release the bike worked, and the rack to put it back worked. I liked the immediate text message confirming my biking was complete and my summary of miles and calories."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/17/2016,"The bikes are OK and convenience is definitely a bonus but customer service and billing is utterly awful. After several unsuccessful attempts to dock my rented bike I thought I had finally docked it properly only to get a text 3 hours later that I was still being charged. I returned to the docking station, successfully docked my rented bike and found out that no matter what I said or did, I would be charged an extra $38 in overage fees simply because the company doesn't refund anything under $40. With failing docking stations and no ability to contest overage charges I would suggest looking elsewhere for bikes. Their system seems to pry on those who are unfamiliar with the process and catch fails set in place are conveniently set to incur the maximum non-refundable fees. Fail."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/03/2016,"CitiBike has literally changed my life. I am not exaggerating whatsoever.  It has completely transformed how I get around the city.  I've been a member since 2014 and am thrilled to be coming into my third year as a member this fall.Pretty much all of the negative reviews of Citibike here are from tourists complaining about the 30 minute time limit...but these bikes aren't really meant for touring purposes.  Citibike is designed for busy New Yorkers who need to get from point A to point B.  Annual members get 45 minutes, which I've never even come close to hitting.Citibike enables me the convenience and freedom of getting anywhere in the city faster and more reliably than public transit, a rideshare service, or a cab.  A trip that could easily take me 35 minutes on public transit takes 17 minutes on a bike.  In fact, having citibike means I can live further east, enjoy my neighborhood, and pay less of a premium for living in Manhattan due to my distance from public transit.Citibike has made lots of improvements since it first started - newer bike models, introduction of valet service, a great app, continued expansion uptown and into the outer boroughs, and more.For locals, I would highly recommend getting the annual membership.  It's $160 a YEAR.  Compare that to $116 a MONTH for a metrocard.  I definitely city bike 9-10 months out of the year - I typically won't if it's snowing or below freezing.  That means I'm saving easily $1000 a year in transportation costs.And for the most part, it's a very pleasant way to get around.  I take it in the morning to my fitness class, and it's usually very calm and relaxing.  If I have a late night at the office, I thoroughly enjoy my 15 minute bike ride in the calm of the evening.  Sometimes commuting during peak times or along 8th Avenue at rush hour can be stressful, but all in all is definitely worth it."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/06/2016,"It was a great experience to ride around the city but be careful to triple check whether your bike was docked (returned) properly! Why? Because you can be charged $1300 for this...Several tips --1. After you return your bike, make sure you see the green light.2. Make sure you receive a text saying ""You docked bike ####. To ride again, insert the same credit card at any kiosk to get a new 5-digit code.""3. You can also sign up for email notifications or app notifications if you wanna be saferCiti bike informed me about this $1300 charge in the morning. The customer service guy told me to file a police report if I want to avoid this charge... I went on reddit and saw several ppl facing the same situation as me. Suggestions to citi bike --1. It will be great if citi bike can offer some kind of bike insurance. Say we didnt dock the bike properly and some random guy stole the bike...i would rather pay for an insurance in advance2. I did not receive any notifications alerting me that I ""havent return the bike"" or ""your bike didnt show up in our system yet. Maybe you should do something about it"" texts. Maybe citi bike can start sending out this kind of alerts."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/29/2017,"Best way to get around NYC!  Fills in the gaps for travel between the subway, bus & walking.  By far the best deal for people who live in NYC is the annual membership.  Gets you 45 minute rides between docking stations.  Plus, once you figure out the various docking station locations near the things & errands you regularly do, the traveling around becomes a snap!"

So, the CITI BIKE is definitely one that my CC got scammed at.Even the phone calls, yes it could be a sale's call BUT I barely receive sale's calls until giving my # @ CITI Bike payment station.well, the charge was not that big but still.. I was really disappointed how poor their security measure is.."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/28/2017,"Do NOT use Citi Bike in New York they charged us just over $230 for the use of 3 bikes for combined 4 hours.  Myself, my husband and 11year old daughter were tourist to New York after taking my son to West Point and took a ride around the city on their bikes not realizing we needed to check them in every 30 minutes. We asked for a refund of the overages as we were unaware and were basically told to go screw ourselves.  The pittance return was $6.97 on a $230.84 bill...  Seriously!What kind of a racket is this?  I get it's our fault as now we see the rules, but seriously tourist are absolutely taken advantage of by this service.  As a tourist to this city who would think you had to rack and unrack a bike every 30 minutes on a ""day"" pass.  Most tourist would think a day pass meant for the ""day"" as we did.  We toured the Brooklyn Bridge on one day, and City Park on the next and are saddened with our experience and the enduring horrible customer service by Sheila H and the manager William.  Sometimes stepping outside the profit made and being compassionate is the right thing to do.  I will never ever use the service again and I will make sure anybody I know is aware of our treatment.Should have known with a big bank sponsored name they would be big bank nickel and dime charges for the little people loaded with predatory fee practices for unsuspecting tourist.#citibikenyc #citibank #predatory #horriblecsomerservice #visitnyc #newyork #samschwartz #newyorkcity #tourism #billdeblasio #deblasio #cbsnewyork"
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/22/2017,Want to say I just went to London and Amsterdam and they also had their own citi bikes. It was so much better as I wasn't charged a deposit fee of $100 onto my debit card to use them. In London I think it was just about 2 pounds and then if you turned it in late you were charged 2 pounds more. It was great! In Amsterdam it was so cheap to rent a bike. If I ever need to rent one in ny again I will go elsewhere.
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,10/05/2016,I like the idea but bikes are extremely heavy and hard to ride uphill. 1st speed is a joke. You pedal and pedal but the bike barely moves making it pretty hard to keep balance.  3rd speed is hard to pedal yet the bike does not move very fast. Plenty of grannies on their private road bikes fly past me in central park.There is no respect for bike lines from both cars and pedestrians
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/10/2017,the worst citi program ever. a scam and robbed money. A day pass doesn't mean a day pass.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/04/2016,"Very convenient IF you know what you're getting.First of all if you look at all the other reviews, you can see most of them are people who did NOT dock the bike within 30 minutes. (which I'll get into shortly)For $12 you get unlimited 30 minute rides around the city in a 24 hour period. This means you NEED to dock the bike within this timeframe to avoid an overage fee of $4 per every 15 minutes you have the bike. Again, all of this is explained, its just people not reading/understanding what they're purchasing which is sad. The reason behind the 30minute limit and charges is so everyone gets a fair chance of renting a bike, if it was truly unlimited, these things would be impossible to find. Just think about that for a second.If you have an iPhone, you NEED to download the citibike app, trust me it will make finding docks easy and it even tells you the availability before you go.To compare things, there was a guy offering me to rent a bike from the business he worked for and it was $15 for 1 hour. For $3 less ($12) you can get a citibike and use it LONGER and the only requirement is to dock it once every 30 minutes. There are docks in almost every corner of NYC so this isn't an issue at all.With the CitiBike I went all over times square and broadway with friends on a recent trip to NYC. We never had issues and we racked up around 8 miles riding/docking the entire day. I would definitely do this again on my next visit! Just keep in mind that riding a bike through a very busy city like NY can be dangerous and you need to be alert of traffic and signals at all times."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/26/2017,"Citi Bike is numero uno when it comes to convenient, exciting and easy ways to explore the City of New York, the Big Onion as they used to call it.  It's now called the Big Apple by some, but those in the know still refer to it by it's old name, New Amsterdam, and those who know also use Citi Bike.  Now that there's an hourly pass, you don't have to worry about space docking every 30 minutes, just take it nice and slow.  It's the best, and you can't go wrong."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/01/2017,"Purchased a day pass for $12. Later got a charge for $30+ for overage charges because I didn't return the bike every 30 minutes. Booking through the app has the day price of $12 in big bold letters and the extra charges in tiny fine print. So if I rent a bike for the full 12 hours I have to return it 24 times over the course of a day? So ridiculous. Congrats Citibike you got me, I will never use your service again."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/05/2017,Great service. No station when I leave work in midtown which is a pain but I understand the difficulties of logistics
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/24/2017,They have an hourly pass for $6 an hour which is awesome. I love citbike.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/05/2017,"Pretty expensive if you just want the bike for a few errands, and having to check in every half hour is crap. Other than that the system is ok and the idea is great."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,02/24/2018,"I think we need more bikes on everything station, love this bikes, they have become my main way to get to work"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/23/2016,I had a wonderful experience!! Was really helpful to trip around the city!!I highly recommend Citi bike!!!
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/30/2018,Deadly combo of raising rates whilst service is deteriorating..never any bikes or docks available especially at hot spots like GCT..don't really need an algorithm to predict that flow.. Some genius gave Citi bank a sweet heart deal when it was founded and all environment conscious NYers pay for it now..shame on Citi bank AND bike to not rectify that!!I canceled my subscription...
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,02/03/2016,"Please read my review with warning!!!Before I start I want to clarify I am not a stupid person, I went to college I can read instructions! I have just found out I have been charged $100 for 2 hours of biking for two bikes. Apparently you have to check the bike into the station every 30 mins or you get charged with this massive fine! I didnt see this clearly marked anywhere. Please take my example and make sure you avoid citibikes, or check them in every 30 mins!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/15/2017,If there were more working bikes (not Red Lights) I'd give it 5 stars. The only problem is that it's too popular and you frequently can't find a bike when you want.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/24/2017,"CitiBike has done a great thing and added an hourly pass! 6 bucks an hour, no security deposit or overages... A really nice addition to their other options especially for tourists or out of towners looking to explore the city. I used to live in New York so an annual pass made sense, but as a visitor from the West Coast now it's nice to have these other options."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/14/2017,Riding around the city with a Citi bike was a great experience however it sucked having to find a dock every 30 mins.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/24/2017,Rode from 3rd Ave & 53rd St downtown to the Staten Island Ferry Terminal via the East River bike path. It was a nice ride and it was easy to use the Citi Bike station to undock & dock a bike. I plan to use it again.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/24/2017,"Worst bike rental service I've ever used. If you don't want to have any overcharges given to you days after you even used a bike, DO NOT use this service. Customer service is just as useless."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/05/2016,"Works in a pinch--especially in high-traffic areas. If you need to get somewhere in a hurry and it's on the other side of a busy area like midtown there is no faster way than to hop on a Citi bike. The alternatives will take longer (subway) or take longer and cost more (cab).If you're looking to do a little leisurely sightseeing these heavy, lumbering, upright bicycles could work for that, too, you just need to keep the re-docking rules in mind that many have mentioned here."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,06/29/2018,"After renting single use twice, I received an email for $25 off annual membership. Great! but code did not work in app, waited for response by email which didn't arrive (did not wait 72 hours though)so called customer service and after a bit of time on hold got a code that worked. Love saving money! Now for the helpful hints to others-always check bike before unlocking-does the seat stay up, gears change, tires inflated, when returning double check that ride ends after docking- even with green light my first ride continued and went over (so much for above discount). Also since I am in Jersey City and wanted to ride to Hoboken Trader Joe's (why is there no Trader Joe's in JC?) it was next to impossible, only two(2) citibike stations up the elevator impossible to ride to! Coming back was dangerous flying down Patterson plank, no bike lane, potholes, road work-I was following the route on app! I am from California and the electric bikes, scooters, dock less and docked bikes are so much more plentiful and user friendly. Time for some competition here! Just saying, and how can I get a closer Trader Joe's?"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/22/2017,Worst strategy to loot money from the people. Don't fall into the trap. Citi has to think of new ways to earn money
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/08/2017,Bike share. Great idea. FYI: must maintain bikes. Seats broken shifts don't work. Miserable. I can only rent one bike her credit card.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/10/2016,"Citibike is a great way to get around the city. I use it for getting to social events in the evenings and weekends and sometimes for commuting too. It's convenient and a lot more fun than the subway and taxis. Before I joined, I was a little concerned about safety, but actually it's a lot safer than first expected. My friends also mentioned that there used to be a lot of problems years ago particularly around docking. It's easy to see that the experience is much smoother now and has definitely improved. In terms of issues, I've had only a few since I started riding earlier this year. These included bike chains not running smoothly and not being able to always find an open dock. Luckily these were few and far between and easily resolved i.e. using the wrench button on the dock & getting another bike (this works great, btw!) and checking the app before I ride to make sure there's an open space. Also, just a final note - while the bag space may be enough for some, it's a little trickier to fit a handbag and laptop bag for us pack-horse type commuters. A larger sized space would be a welcome addition to the next series of bikes! All in all, a great experience."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/12/2017,"0 for 2 with bikes: first skipped out of gear, second wouldn't shift at all. Customer service was zero help. Not worth your money."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/16/2017,Good location. Many bikes. Doing this review to see if I can get another discount. 25 bucks.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/28/2017,"Excellent for getting around the city. We used CitiBike to see Central Park, The Met and grab lunch at Eatly in the Flatiron district. Just plan your day in 30 minute travel increments."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,05/28/2017,Pretty good system and reliable service. Great for visiting sites in the downtown area. It would be better if the service expands to the other boroughs and Uptown.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/01/2017,"It's surprising how much faster I can get around on the bike. No train delays. No fighting traffic in a car. Plus, I'm getting in shape."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/12/2016,"Awesome alternative to the subway - super easy to use and makes New York seem so much smaller! Docks almost everywhere you look, and the app makes it easier still. Only gripe - the weight of the bikes!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/28/2014,"Lots of fun to ride a bike along the Hudson river bike path. I easily found bikes at the closest location. The kiosk interface was easy to navigate and the credit card reader worked well. I plugged in my rental number to the bike of my choice and zipped away. The trick with renting this bikes is to lift the seat when getting one from the lock mechanism. I rode from battery park to 16 the st in 30 minutes (needed a few photos), exchanged the bike to meet the 30 min limit, and rode back. It was terrific. These bikes, like those in Boston, Chicago and Paris, are wide seat heavy cruisers with 3 speeds. You can't go fast, but this also means its harder to harm yourself/ others. This is especially important since no helmets are available and you're riding in a city!  The price of this rental was a little high but still acceptable. Unlike my experiences elsewhere, there were adequate docking stations everywhere I wanted to dock in NYC, but I think thats only because I rode at 6 am!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/01/2015,"The Citi Bike sucks.  Charged me 40 dollars per bike for 2 hour usage.  Wont ever use it again.At the station, when you got the bikes, you thought you got a bike for up to 24 hours as the screen displayed"" 24-hour pass"". HOWEVER, It did not made clear at the station at all that you had to return the bike within 30 mins. WOW, VERY IMPRESSIVE on the TRICKS to cheat the new users. Any place within a 30 mins bike distance, why should I pay more than $10 to ride there and also have to look for a station to return it,  rather than just request a Uber? Greedy Banks... So sad"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,11/26/2015,"Personally using citibike is a pretty neat way to explore NYC there are many docking stations around the city. The bikes have a place to put your backpack/bag they have tire guards, lights, a bell, and the bikes are all three speed. Key is remembering to dock the bike (if you rent it for 24 hours) every 30 minutes. I'd give a rating of 5 stars however, sometimes when I docked the bike and went to get the code the machine would run out of paper (remember the codes to pull the bike back out) or get stuck in my situation of thinking ""what on earth?! How do I pull the bike out again I don't remember the code, and there is no paper with the code"".With all that being said there are bike lanes so it not too crazy biking around in traffic but with the amount of tourists walking everywhere especially on the bike path I'd make sure you get the bike that does not have a broken bell or you'll find yourself constantly shouting ""bike"" or ""left""."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/28/2017,First time renting a bike with citi bike at Central Park. Ended up on other side of park and there were no docking stations so I went over the 30 minute rental rule.  Ended up getting charged $39.20 twice! Called customer service and explained what happened being a first time renter and not being able to find a docking station! Was told I would be credited back one of the $39.20 charges and to check in 2 days. I was never given the refund I was told I would get and am very dissatisfied with their customer service. I will never rent a bike from them again.
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/09/2015,"30 minutes per ride!?!This is an obnoxiously small amount of time. An hour would be reasonable but, you cant go any distance that is worth renting a bike for $10 in 30 minutes.However, what do I expect when you put blood sucking Citibank in charge of what could have been a fantastic resource for NY'ers and Tourists.And a minimum $4 punishment for overages...Another great idea ruined by greed."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/20/2017,A helpful and convenient transportation option to get around the city with. Let's me so my errands with a lot more speed and efficiency.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/16/2014,"For around $100, you get a ""magical"" blue fob (annual subscription) that gives you access to any bike in NYC and the 5 boroughs for 45 minutes.  Think you'll run out time and don't want to pay an overage fee?  Return the bike to any kiosk, wait 2 minutes and unlock another... You're good for another 45 minutes, and so on, and so on...If you live or work in NYC and don't subscribe to CitiBike on an annual basis, shame on you -- you've made a mistake.  I had my CitiBike epiphany last year and made over 100 one-way trips over the year, avoiding the $2.50 subway fare and saving over $150 over the course of the year (while logging nearly 700 miles of heart healthy cycling exercise).CitiBike offers a great, healthy option for mixing up your NYC commute.  It also offers a second option when you don't want to deal with an overcrowded rush hour subway.NYC was voted the most bike-friendly city by Bicycling magazine in 2014.  With over hundreds of miles of dedicated bike lanes and the popular West Side Greenway, find out what you've been missing and get yourself in shape!  I promise you'll see NYC in ways you haven't before and you'll encounter many memorable photo opportunities.Minus one star as a kiosk problem will be encountered from time to time, but generally the system works as expected."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/23/2014,"I purchased an annual membership recently. It was $95 but with $8 tax and $15 discount for paying with a Citi credit card, it came out to $88. (Note that tax is assessed even if you do not live in New York.) I've mainly been using it to get from the World Trade Center and Christopher St PATH stations to Chinatown, since crosstown public transit sucks in that area. (If not NYC in general - seriously, when's the last time you rode the L?)The biggest positive is simply the existence of the service. Being able to take out a bike anywhere in Mid/Lower Manhattan or Downtown Brooklyn and drop it off elsewhere is very convenient. It's also cheap, at less than $8 a month.As for negatives, the main one is that it is difficult to pull out or push in a bike. When renting a bike, it doesn't always work the first time; it probably takes an average of 1.5 tries to get it right. Returning the bike is even harder; I'd estimate it takes an average of 2 tries (the record for me was 5 so far). Also, a successful return is supposed to be indicated by a green light, but sometimes it doesn't show up and you only know if the bike has been locked in place (but not if the system recognizes that). Then, if you really want to make sure it's been returned successfully, you have to log on to the website or call them to verify."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/23/2016,"Overall the best per dollar thing I pay for each year. The annual membership is so worth it, you get unlimited riding for a while year! Not to mention the 45min limit can even be extended if you dock for 2mins, you can even take the same bike out again, no extra charge!I use city bikes probably 8 times a week to commute from Brooklyn to midtown Manhattan. I hate bike maintenance, which is a big reason I love citi bikes. Yes the bikes all aren't perfect but cone on the are outside all year around. You don't like a bike then lock it up and grab another one. Run over a pot hole? No big deal. Something wrong with the bike? I am not going to have to fix it or have to pay for it.For me it's the perfect way to not only commute but also get between subway stops, zip around midtown traffic or even scenic weekend rides chaining together 45min rides. Do yourself a favor and give it a chance, don't get frustrated when a bike squeaks, is a bit heavy (better workout) or the seat won't stay (just need to twist the round thing on the seat adjuster tighter)."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/30/2015,"Never any bikes available near me--and they just removed the station outside my apartment! Why exactly did I pay for this garbage? Theres no reason i should have to walk halfway to my destination just for an available bike. On top of that there is no identifiable system for ensuring available docks, so i sometimes end up riding around for 15 minutes AFTER reaching my destination, so i, show up to my meetings sweaty AND late. Avoid!  Just get yourself a used bike, way cheaper in the end anyway. If this review stops just one person from renting citibike then I'll be happy.But hey, I'm the sucker who shelled out the simoleans"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,09/29/2015,"Citibike Bike needs to do a MUCH better job at rebalancing empty and full stations. Almost always no docking stations available near work in the morning (Flatiron) and almost no bikes available there in the evening.  I'd think there are a lot of people willing to do this work at low wages so Citi Bike's failure to do this better shows a high level of disregard to customers who pay an annual fee in order to have a bike when they need it. To whoever is responsible for rebalancing and allocating resources for that: DO YOUR JOB BETTER.It reminds me of the brainiacs who determined that it is a good idea for all taxis in the city to change over schedules at the same time instead of staggering schedules.  Otherwise, the program is great- best way to get around the city when it works."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/05/2015,"Worst service ever!  I've been charged over300 dollars for 12 hours of service.  The system failed at the docking spot, regardless of the green light and the customer service people knowing that there was an extra bike in the docks.  They left me high and dry with the use of 12 hours on a 24 hour contract.  I am from colorado, so instead refunding the money they took an extra 171 in addition to the deposit of 101.Which why do they a deposit of they have ur credit card?  Anyways after spending a great deal of time and effort...they will not refund any money for half only 12 hours of service because their system failed to see the nber on the bike dock!Bad customer service Jermaine and Tina!!!!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/18/2014,"I saw an earlier review that declared Citibike life changing.... I would have to agree.I purchased the annual pass with my Citi debit card and received a 15% rebate back.I figured I could make up the cost if I take 8 less cab rides this year.I passed that pretty quickly.1.It saves a ton of money and time. I can get from the Port Authority to work (55 and Mad) faster than the subway, and only a few minutes more than a cab. I can make it down to NYU from midtown faster than the subway, and for $20 less than a cab. The savings REALLY add up.2. You can really add in a lot more activity. The 30 minutes a day I spend on the bike getting to and fro are just another 30 minutes of heart healthy activity.3.It is enjoyable. The other morning I was very early, so went for a quick lower loop in Central Park. It is relaxing, and also a great way to connect with the city in a different manner.Only downside is it seems like everyone is moving in the same direction, so sometimes stations are empty or full, but there are so many that it really doesn't matter."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,06/04/2016,"Weiss Citi Bike as a tourist, and it was okay. There aren't enough docking stations put in places they would be used. Go above 87th street in Central Park so I can bike throughout the park. I also noticed that kiosks are a couple of blocks from any attraction save Times Square. I also had trouble putting my bike up and renting another bike. It would say there was an error, bikes wouldn't release with the codes, or once the entire terminal decided not to release a single one of the eight bikes there. When we called for help, it didn't really help. After saying crazy basic stuff like, ""Did you put your code in?"" She said all the bikes must be broken. It would be nice if the app had told me that.Overall, a fun way to see New York but it has some flaws. I'd look at more stations near attractions. Also, as an outsider, I found it.....um, let's go with 'interesting' that areas I know are wealthier had bike rental abilities, while others...didn't. Include everyone, yo."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/17/2016,"Docking stations are starting to fail, no initiatives from the company, a lack of competence and support from the customer service department.Citibike is becoming the victim of their own success. As a user since 2013, I am utterly and absolutely disappointed and angry with Citibike. As the company grows, there are more users leading to disproportionate distributions of the bike availability as well as the wear and tear of the bikes. however, the customer service has not grown with it. I had an incident that I couldn't dock my bike even after going through three different stations and trying every single available dock. Citibike actually asked me to take the bike home with me. It took 4 phone calls from my end for someone to take the bike after 2 days and they even had the audacity to charge me for those time. I also had to tell my story every single time I called. When I asked to speak to a manager, they refused to come to the phone. I am so profoundly disappointed. Mr. Jay Walder, something needs to be done with your company, otherwise, you will keep losing money left and right. Isn't that why you came to be the CEO in the first place?"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,10/23/2017,Citibike is great. But there are not enough docking stations uptown- and probably in other neighborhoods as well. Why not economize by building stations in less- popular areas (like uptown) with less slots? This would seem to be a win win compromise.
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,04/16/2017,"Great bikes , great idea. Just sometimes bike stack at docking station. Also 30 min max ... What is this ??? 2017 USA. No freedom ? People pay so charge 20-30$ and let people to use ..."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/05/2015,"Firstly, let me alert tourists and oversea's visitors that the program is basically an old fashioned bait and switch to lure low-knowledge visitors to using a program for $10 and subsequently put hidden charges on their credit card. Its disgusting that NYC would stoop to this level of activity. I will explain more later but for now: Caveat Emptor. You can take a gamble to try and avoid ""hidden charges"" and I will explain in this review how, but its more headache than its worth. IMO you are much better off renting a bike from one of the local shops than using this ridiculous boondoggle.Now the review!Summary: Terrible, sadly all roads in NYC lead to disaster!Conceptually very similar to the excellent programs that are run in London/D.C (I've used both) but with one big UNIQUE catch that makes this a disaster for tourists - MAX 30 MINS RIDE. Yes, read that again and remember - you have 30 minutes from check-out to check-in.How it works: using a credit card you check-out a bike that you ride around and then check-back in within 30 mins. Like a library book! Bike stations are present all over the place, even Brooklyn. That's the theory, but here's the reality.1. There's hidden fee's which can be up to 5x the $10 rental fee.2. The hidden fee's are incurred when you can't check the bike in on time.3. Maintenance problems and lack of stations result in 2 all day long.Theoretically, what you're getting is a $10 hop-on hop-off bike.Reality is that you're taking a huge gamble with your credit card using this.Of-course everything was great when the program was new and flush with cash, but now that's running out the equipment is degrading fast, very fast! Most of the time you can pick up a bike, but its a gamble whether you'll be able to get it checked back in within the ridiculous 30 minute timeline. Miss that? More charges. Take longer than 15 minutes to check-in? More charges ... it can easily add up to over $100 in overage charges on a single day. They're raking in millions in overage fee's on credit cards and will continue to do so until the regulators step in. Classic NYC, use exorbitant charges on tourists to fund the politicians and fat cat union salaries. Remember the bad old days of Internet subscription web-sites, once you give your credit card details, its up to them what they bill you - this is very similar. Now that the Euro is cratering I'm not sure how long this crazy scheme is going to last and the bike scheme collapses.On my recent trip I went to check my bike back in and at best had to make 5 or 6 attempts before one of the stations accepted it. That's IF I found an empty station - the racks in mid-town are absolutely packed. This is a good theory but due to lack of maintenance its simply not reliable, much better to UBER or use the sub.Now, how to avoid the hidden charges? Simple - surf bike racks. This way you only ride the bike for 15 minutes, check it in (may take multiple attempts in the 15 minutes) and then check it out 2 mins later. Simple! No overage charges. Yes, this means a lot of check-in/check-out, but this is the ONLY way you can reduce (you never completely eliminate) the risk of being hit with massive charges.This boondoggle was created at the peak of the easy credit bubble and its deteriorating fast. Already theres reports that this is a real money sink and NYC has losing money hand over fist. Either thats going to result in more maintenance cut-backs, outrageous fee's or eventually the program will be phased out. I think its the last one."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/03/2014,"I am giving 3 starts cause after all the bad experience trying to get the codes to unlock the bikes we did have a fun going bar hopping in these bikes. This is what u gotta do, get one by one, don't try getting 2 codes at once cause that will not work, if the first code you get doesn't work then go back to the machine after 2 mins and press get a new code and swipe your card (YOU WONT GET CHARGED AGAIN) they only needed to make sure you got a code before, that's all, once you get the new code then that should work. CITI BIKE please fix your damn system as it's really an inconvenience for everyone to rent your bikes, BARCLAYS bikes in London don't have this issue at all, come on! Get this fixed ASAP"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/27/2013,"I figure I'd give it a try since it was a nice day and I was running late for a doctors appointment.  I purchased a 24hr pass for $10 and went to unlock my bike with a 5 digit code. I looked for a receipt or perhaps something that printed out my code since I'm dyslexic, but nada.  I think the printer ran out of paper and this seemed to happen more than once at the stations I went to.  The seat easily adjusted all the way down since I'm vertically challenged.  I was surprised the basket fit my giant handbag.  Then I was on my way!  My challenge was to survive without being run over by crazy taxi's* or squished by a giant bus.  I made it 10 blocks in less than 10 mins. Perfect!  Right on time for my appointment.  I would've been late waiting for the bus and I would've paid about $8 to go 10 blocks in a Taxi.  So I returned the same way I came, except I got stuck in the bus lane and couldn't cross 3 lanes on 3rd.  I was getting honked at.  I hope the cops aren't going to start ticketing the Citibikers.  It'll take me some time to get used to riding in the city and I think I'll get a helmet and leave it at work.  For now I'll just stick with the daily/weekly pass because over the last few nights after work, I can't find a bike anywhere near Grand Central.  After 5:30 it's like rush hour for Citibikes.  I see them everywhere, as many yellow cabs there are Citibikes.The iPhone app is helpful in finding the nearby stations and the availability of bikes.  It's about 99.99% accurate.  I walked to a few stations and there were no bikes, just the broken ones that don't undock.A few tips for you new riders:-Use your iPhone notes to take down the 5 digit code if the station doesn't print out your code/receipt!-If you get the daily/weekly pass, each time you go to a new station for a bike you have to swipe your card again to get another code.-Check the bike before you undock it!  I found one w/o a pedal.-Don't ride in the bus lane unless you really have to.-If there's a red light on the bike, the bike is broken.-When docking your bike, push it in and hold it there for about 40 secs.  Then make sure it's locked in before you leave!*remember that video game?  I used to love running everybody over in my yellow crazy taxi!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/04/2013,"From the perspective of a tourist in NYC for the long weekend Citibike is outstanding. Firstly I must admit that I am slightly biased as I am from Montreal, where this bike sharing system was developed, so I was proud to see our system being used in New York. We spent the entire weekend in NYC without ever having to take the subway thanks to Citibike, Amazing! We used it to go everywhere and only once did we arrive at a station to find that there were not two docks available for us (I'm sure on a work day the situation may be more difficult). On this occasion one of us had to ride an extra 2 blocks to dock the bike, no big deal. I was also very impressed with the development of bike lanes in Manhattan and have to say that I felt safe riding throughout the city. If you stick to the streets with designated bike lanes you seem to always be only a couple of blocks away from a station. Hopefully the city will continue to expand the system (which is only available south of 60th street and in certain areas of the other boroughs) and continue to make the city more bike friendly."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,07/11/2016,"Very disappointed lately by Citibike this Spring / Summer. I bought a year pass when they expanded to the UWS and am 11 months into it.  I just unchecked the auto renew option on their website. Within 1/2 a block of my apartment there is a 63 bike dock one way and a 21 bike dock the other way.  That's 84 spots for bikes.  Expanding that radius I soon get another 51, 27, and 55 dock in comfortable walking distance, another 133 more docks.  Beyond that I have walked past numerous subway stations.In Fall 2015 and Winter 2015 no problems getting bikes, now it seems that everyone on the UWS woke up to this being a thing and there are zero bikes from a potential population of 217 docks available by 7.45 AM.  They really need to refill stations and do something now. I work in midtown and similarly the bike availability is scant throughout the day, this last few weeks the days I get bikes it is either 100f and humid, or raining.Additionally the app has got really slow to update the bike availability, just this morning I walked to a dock the app was saying had 25 bikes, half way there it updated to zero.  I don't believe that 25 users just pulled bikes from the rack.  I'm going to try the Univelo NYC app instead of the citibike one to see if that does a better job staying up to date with bike availability.I have not experience the dock not working problem (actually I have, once).  Mostly this is user error, make sure you lift the rear of the bike by the saddle when the light goes green, make sure the bike is upright and straight into the dock.  Now bike maintenance, they seem to have fixed the teething troubles with the gen 2 bikes and have them back in service but still there are not enough bikes around.  Also when you flag a bike as needing maintenance it sits in the dock for days, taking that dock out of service and the bike!  A double whammy to usability in the system, flagging a bike as not working is against your own self interests as it cloggs up the system where you travel!It's become a service I pay for that I cannot rely on being available when I need it.For day / 3 day / week renters, read the words directly to the left of the credit card slot.  RIDES OVER 30 MINUTES INCUR EXTRA FEES.  They really make it pretty clear."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,11/20/2016,"Love the fact that they're are plenty of bike stations and the Citibike App tells you how many bikes are available at a station, so you can plan your trip ahead of time."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,04/24/2015,"I work and live downtown, so the IDEA of Citibike is great. I can skip the subway on a nice night and commute, run errands, etc.Ideally.What actually happens? Last night, for example, I spent 30 minutes trying EVERY SINGLE docking station at 2 different spots (9th ave. and 18th; 9th ave. and 21) and NONE were accepting bikes. There were at least 20 spots between the two. Getting bikes out is the same story, most of the time.I then had to go, out of my way and cutting into my schedule, to 20th and 8th which, thankfully, had one dock accepting bikes. I have seen bikes carelessly leaned up against racks that I can only assume frustrated riders have ditched after fruitless efforts to dock at broken stations. For the amount of use and advertised availability this is absolutely unacceptable! When I now have to inconvenience myself and break my ass circling the neighborhood to find a WORKING dock before my time is up and I start getting charged, I have a MAJOR problem with that.  FIX YOUR DOCKING SYSTEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/22/2016,"We rented four city bikes on our recent vacation to NYC. We wanted to ride through Central Park. The bicycle attendant was very helpful with helping us rent our bikes and giving us instructions about docking the bikes. What he forgot to mention however was that you have to dock the bikes every 30 minutes or you will be charged a crazy amount of money. It does say this on the website, but at the actual location it does not.  Had we been aware we would have docked the bikes accordingly instead of being charged $122 dollars for a hour and a half bike ride. When we called customer service they were rude about it . Apparently you can't speak to a manager, only submit claims. They review the claims and respond to agents who relay the message. The whole thing is very sketchy and unorganized."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/14/2013,"First blush review.  I will be updating because I feel privileged to be contributing to saving the planet, however, my first ride wasn't exactly perfect.The seat couldn't be adjusted, and the first 2 drop off points were full, even though their app said their were available slots.Not good.  Overall, a good experience that I'm hoping will only get better, but they're going to need to really work at maintaining and improving this."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/29/2016,"Set Up to Take Advantage of Unsuspecting Customers.  If you think this is a fun a wonderful way to see the sites in NYC, think again.  It's set up so that you have to dock and re-dock the bike every 30 minutes.  You think you're paying for an all day pass for $12 but really they will charge you exorbitant fees for any time over the 30 minutes that you don't dock the bike.  I just received my bank statement and had overage charges because I docked the bike within 32 minutes instead of 30.  You have to locate a citi bike docking station enroute to wherever you're going and that was not fun.  All in, the charges for the time that I went over 30 minutes were more than the day pass.I have to say that we really enjoyed riding the bikes around the city but this system of docking every 30 minutes and charging exorbitant fees would prevent me from ever doing it again."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/29/2016,"I'm not going to complain about the overage fees that many Yelpers are complaining about because I know how to read the rules/directions (and I have a yearly pass which I guess makes me more experienced than most). And in general I think Citibike is an amazing addition to NYC that is generally useful and a great way to connect places that our subway doesn't connect.But lately, in addition to my previous review:(1) They've been sooooooo lazy about refilling the stations. I could somewhat understand if they just filled the stations at night and then the stations happened to be empty by the time I go to work in the morning because other commuters take them first. But nope -- I check on the app every night before bed -- and I'm lucky if they even refill 2 out of the nearest 7 stations to me. The rest they just leave empty. Which means that I can't use a bike to commute to work and I can't use a service that I'm paying for. If they want Citibike to work they need to understand the patterns of how and when people commute and then not only refill the stations at night but also in the morning mid-way through the rush hours -- otherwise the system isn't going to work!(2) The brakes on 90% of the older bikes (which make up from my estimation about 80% of the total fleet now that they've been taking the new bikes out of service for repair) are totally worthless. You have to squeeze really really hard for any effect and even then it's minimal braking. I've nearly hit pedestrians and nearly been hit by cars because of these useless brakes. And no I am not a particularly fast or reckless rider - I follow the rules of the road. (3) They also don't really clean the bikes. The handlebars of most of them are disgustingly sticky(4) Customer service is pretty useless. They email back quickly saying ""oh, I'll forward your comments to our team"" and then nothing ever changes."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,04/07/2015,"After almost 2 years remains a system with great POTENTIAL.  Seems they've outsourced customer service.   Last night I attempted to return a bike to 24th street and Lex. Months ago the busy station 2 blocks north had been removed (Citi Bike told me it was do to construction - but there's been none whatsoever). Now the Lex 24 station (next to Baruch College)  is out of service.  I called customer service to find out the status and the rep said (incredibly): ""we don't have information on that - let me put you on hold and check social media"". Say what??!!  SOCIAL MEDIA??!!   But I called CITI BIKE!!! How can they not have info on their OWN stations?  UNACCEPTABLE.They maintain  a Facebook page - but if you post a comment you can't even find it. I think they remove negative comments and questions. So overall, as a ""member"" it's hugely frustrating to feel such a ""disconnect"" with customer service. System updates seem to be sporadically issued at their whim. Finally, there are some no-brainer fixes (many are SAFETY related)  which I hope so see one day SOON:1)  BROKEN STATIONS. You can push a button to report a broken bike - so there should be a similar  button you can press when a  docking station is broken and won't accept bikes (any member will tell you there a few broken docking stations per location).  Right now CB wants you to take the time and CALL them to report broken docking stations. Please!! And why do these stations break so often? SUE THE MANUFACTURER!!   Don't raise our rates.2) BROKEN GEARS. About one third to one half of all bikes have useless, slipping third gears. This is both incredibly inconvenient (unless you want a spin class kind of work out and have LOTS of time to get where you're going) and DANGEROUS.   They should address this IMMEDIATELY with the manufacturer. SAFETY ISSUE. Why does this happen so much? SUE THE MANUFACTURER!!   Don't raise our rates.3)  CRAPPY BELLS. The bells are not loud enough (a mere chime), fail frequently and are inconvenient to use. They should be completely replaced with something actually USEFUL. This is IMPORTANT in a busy city such as NYC.  SAFETY ISSUE. Why do the bells hardly work? SUE THE MANUFACTURER!!   Don't raise our rates.4) KICK STANDS.  Seems more and more bikes don't have kick stands anymore. WHY??!!!!  INCREDIBLY INCONVENIENT and, again DANGEROUS.  Easy drop a bike into a car lane while your getting set to ride or dismounting. 5) WHIMPY LIGHTS.  Especially the critical, rear lights -  a mere flicker of red. When you see lights other bikers use, you KNOW there are significantly brighter lights being manufactured. The LED technology exists - so PLEASE put it to use!!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/05/2016,"My boyfriend and I had a blast using citibike for the first time, we grabbed a bite to eat, rode through a few parks and explored Brooklyn. We found citibike docks with ease every time we wanted to make a stop. I would recommend citibike to anyone."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/12/2017,"I purchased a day pass for a citibike last Saturday and rode it for 20 mins then locked it to a dock to go to the bar nearby. After 2 hours, I came out and try to use the bike again. Apparently, according to Citibike, I did not properly lock my bike and it was gone! I called the customer service, they claimed that I would be fully responsible and I would be charged for $1200 if the bike is missing! They also said there was nothing they could do and suggest that I should go to the police station and file a report of the missing bike immediately (it was 1 am). So I went to the police station and the police said that there's nothing they can do for me since it is not my property. They are angry that Citibike continues to send people to police station knowing that there's nothing they can do about it!. Cikibike acted careless about the whole situation and direct their customers to the wrong places. I will NEVER use Citibikes again!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/07/2015,"Citi bike is my favourite mode of transport. They are safe, cheap and convenient. Downtown they are everywhere. A further expansion into Brooklyn, above 59th in Manhattan and starting in Queens would be amazing.Everyone needs this!"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/16/2013,"Well, a little over a month after the launch and sadly I'm going to have to downgrade Citi Bike to 2 and a half stars for now.Let's start with the good: whatever problems there were with docking bikes seem to have been resolved. So have the long waits on the customer service line; calls are answered in less than a minute now. And on weekends, Citi Bike has been great; I can almost always find a bike and it's a great way to get around.  I'd give it a B+.But weekdays are an F.  I signed up for Citi Bike mostly so I could commute to and from my job in east Midtown, which I did every day for the first three weeks.  Since then, there are never any places to dock a bike in the morning and there are never any bikes available after 5. I wouldn't mind walking a few blocks to another station, but there are literally NO bikes available ANYWHERE within a ten block radius of my office.  Citi Bike is supposed to rebalance stations by transporting bikes to where they are needed, but as far as I can tell this is never done. I'm not getting the service I paid for and it sucks.The Citi Bike app needs a tweak, too.  I find it's generally accurate, but when a bicycle is out of service and can't be checked out (red light), there is no point in listing it as available on the app. I would hate to walk 4 blocks to a station with 6 ""available"" bikes when none of them are actually available to rent.I'm still a big supporter of the program--I know it can't be easy starting a bike share in a place like New York and the response has been overwhelming (over 50,000 annual members!), but it's pretty clear NYC Bike Share was not up to the challenge and won't be for quite some time."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,01/29/2017,Citi bike is the best!  Thank you NYC & Citibank. Saves my family time and money and gives us extra exercise!
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,12/14/2016,Used a day pass to try it out. Biked from Columbus Circle to 46th street and 3rd. I found the system worked really well. Plenty of bikes and empty slots at all locations. My gripe is the brakes were dangerously weak. Had to stop by putting my legs down.  I hope someone is checking on this!
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/07/2017,"I got a Citibike on Sunday. Since this was my first time ever using one, I called a customer care from bike stand. I mentioned to her that I have never used this service before and was in a rush. I asked her about the plans they offer and if I can take the bike on hourly basis. She mentioned that they only have 1 day, 3 days, monthly and annual plans. Since I needed the bike only for few hours, I went with a daily pass. The customer care representative asked me to spot a kiosk nearby to complete the transaction. What she ignored telling me is that the bike needs to be docked every 30 minutes to a bike stand to avoid a late fee. On returning the bike, I saw a humongous charge on my credit card of 100+. On calling customer care multiple times, every time I was told curtly that 'you need to plan your trip accordingly, '12$ is for system use', 'there is nothing we can do' etc. They adjusted the charge nominally on requesting a first-time courtesy but did not do it completely.This bike service is a complete scam and rip off. The customer agents are rude and this company is in business of making money based on customer's ignorance. With the amount of money they charged me, I could have bought an actual bike and used it forever!  I want to question the rationale for this policy. If this is for bike sharing, the customers should be charged overtime only when the bikes there are less bikes available at the stand (similar to demand based pricing of Uber). The whole bike stand where I took the bike from was full! It pains to know that a large bank like Citi is sponsoring such an unethical company bike company! It seems both are not able to earn money by fair and regular business and adopting to such practices. Are consumer agencies listening to customer's plights and can this unfair policy be changed?Why am I being subject to something I was not aware of? Something that the customer care did not care to explain to me completely? I could have opted not to ride the bike that day. How does the charge of $ 100+ plus taxes justify using the bike for few hours in addition to paying a daily rate of $12 plus taxes and being liable for 1200$ for a lost or stolen bike? The company needs to train the customer service agents to give complete information and change the unfair overtime fees policy.I am simply not prepared and 'cannot afford' to pay 112$ as a bike rental for a day. I am sure others like you value your hard-earned money as well."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/17/2016,"Really fun!  The only reason I didn't 5 stars is the map at the terminal did not give all the stations so I took a cab when I could have biked. The texts really help. I'm going to join for a year. I hope more people use this so we can get more bike lanes!And here's a tip.... There is a bungee cord for tying a package to the front ""basket"" near the handles. Kept my dinner take-out safe on the ride home!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/25/2016,"Great service. Fun to bike around the city - feels like you can see and experience more than other modes of transportation. However it was annoying when there were not enough free docks so you are having to bike a around trying to find a free dock to return your bike and end up far from your destination. And lots of bikes were broken - flat tire, gears that do not stay in gear... Somewhat dangerous because the gear thing you don't know is a problem until you start riding already. Thank goodness we didn't run into any brake problems."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/01/2013,"Pros:-It's not the lightest bike but it gets me from east side to west side much quicker than the crosstown buses!-It costs less than my monthly unlimited metrocard for the ENTIRE year-It's easy to navigate once you get a hand of it, sturdy and stable, I was able to bike w my flipflops :)-They're all over the city!Cons:-you might not find a bike from time to time-there's NO app for my window phone-you gotta pedal hard and fast if you're going to longer distance that'll take longer than 45mins-there's not too many docking stations in inner brooklyn or queensAll in all, I still like it better than weekend MTA!"
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,02/09/2015,"CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS. I was charged over 100 bucks by Citibike because the dock malfunctioned one night and my bike didn't lock (even though I saw the green light). As a result Citibike recorded that I took a 7 HOUR trip between 11pm and 6am. Huh?! I called for a refund but they have a strict 90-day refund policy and I missed the deadline. I told them that a 7 hour trip in the middle of the night clearly wasn't consistent with my riding history (almost 400 trips so far) but they're mad stubborn and they refused. So be warned. Check your credit card statements and do it often, because these bikes DO malfunction after enough trips and you will get charged (my roommate also got charged $60 for a ride he never took). Since Citibike's docking technology clearly isn't ready for prime time, and their organization is inflexible when it comes to refunds, I won't be renewing my annual membership for at least a couple years until I can be sure I won't get slapped with extra fees."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/28/2016,Such a great experience. Riding the citibike in Brooklyn was amazing. I Hope to see citibikes all around Brooklyn.
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,07/06/2016,"The rates on this are stupid for the day pass which is what I was trying out for the first time. You can only ride the same bike 30 minutes before you have to turn it? That's so stupid considering I (and many others I assume) were using it to get to and from work. At least give like a 40 minutes per ride before charging a another $4 on the $13 daily pass. Especially for a user who has to be even more careful biking in the city for the first time ever, give us a break. Whoever calculated the 30 minute rule should be fired."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/06/2016,"Please test the brakes before you ride. I used a bike that didn't have functional brakes. To say these bikes can be poorly maintained is an understatement. I've always had minor issues when I used this service: bike without kickstand, wheel wasn't perfectly aligned with the handle bars, bent wheel, squeaking brakes. After the time when I couldn't stop at a red light. I refuse to use them ever again. I got my refund when I complained so their customer service wasn't as inept as people claim. The idea is great, it's just the execution has major flaws.Just be careful."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,12/27/2014,"This was my third time using citi bike as a tourist in New York. The sheer fact that it works at all and that you can hop on a bike and zoom for miles through this magical city makes up for a lot of its imperfections. So that's the main ""pro""--it exists. Unfortunately the cons can be exasperating and with each visit I find a new glitch. Here's the list of systemic failures that I've encountered, listed here not to dissuade you from using the bikes but to save you some frustration. 1. All bike docks end at the southern border of Central Park, so you can forget about biking the charming upper west side, the park itself, or biking to the best art museums in the city, like the Met or the Frick.  2. Many stations don't work. Sometimes the kiosks have a little out of order sign, but sometimes they don't, which leads to a lot of wasted time discovering for yourself that the the dock is on the fritz. 3. NEW GLITCH JUST DISCOVERED THIS TRIP: Once you use your credit card to rent a bike, you are locked out of using that credit card again anywhere in the system until that pass expires. Confused? Here's how this little slice of misery works. Yesterday I used my credit card to rent a 24 hour pass at noon while my wife and two kids were shopping in SOHO. For the next 3 hours I blissfully explored all of lower manhattan. Then my wife wanted to join me. We met at a dock and I tried to buy another 24 hour pass for here, but I got an error message when I dipped my credit card. ""You are not authorized to use another bike...."" or something similar. I called the citibike number and was told that I had to use a different credit card to make another purchase. Problem was that we only had the one credit card between us. A ten minute conversation ensued during which I suggested a few solutions but it was the land of no's. They would NOT refund my 3 hour old purchase so that my card would be reset and I could purchase 2 passes. They would NOT just wipe my card out of their system without a refund (I was perfectly willing to eat the original $10 and pay an extra $20 for two passes). They could NOT take a different credit card number over the phone, I had to have the plastic at the machine. Bottom line: we were unable to ride together (I know, poor us, we had to walk to the Brooklyn bridge, a first world problem), and citibike refused to allow us to pay them an extra $20. No wonder the system filed for bankruptcy--but was recently saved by a new investor. I hope they devote a night to reading yelp reviews as they reboot the system...."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,12/06/2014,"Relying on Citi Bike for transportation is like an exercise in the frivolities of human romance: you absolutely love and adore it when it works, and you absolutely detest it when it doesn't. My friend and I visited Manhattan over a few days while the weather happened to be extraordinarily sunny and warm. ""Why not purchase the 24-hr day pass for $10 instead of taking the subway?"" we thought. Initially, riding the bikes was an absolutely joy. We zipped around Manhattan to the places we needed to go, felt the wind rustle through our hair, and even beat the estimated transit time by subway. Our second trip with the day pass was when the problems began. We couldn't find bikes at a the first station we passed. We biked to another station, which had bikes that wouldn't unlock. Then we biked to yet another station, where the bikes STILL wouldn't budge. Finally, by the fifth or so station, we were able to unlock two bikes. Unfortunately, this series of events happened multiple times throughout the day. On the fourth time, exasperated, we finally gave up.Citi Bike is a great experiment that proves that people will embrace the concept of bike sharing. The execution of this bike sharing program, on the other hand, needs a lot of work. I would not recommend Citi Bike share because despite it being fantastic when it works correctly, if you depend on it for more than a few trips, it will undoubtedly fail you."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/29/2016,"Revised review -- DO NOT purchase a 24 hour pass! Despite the fact that it states you will be charged only $13 for a 24 hour unlimited use ride package, they actually withhold $101 dollars from your cc account every time you buy a pass. A bit alarmed when I saw this charge on my statement, I called citibike customer service to let them know I didn't remember agreeing to this large fee, they informed me that indeed, it is in the very fine print when you agree to their user statement when renting, thus they would do nothing for me and instead told me that it was up to my bank or cc company to refund the balance of $88 back to my account which as you know, could take up to several days. When I asked why the hold was so large in comparison to the advertised cost of a day pass, she had no answer and didn't seem to mind at all either when I told her I thought this policy was very sneaky and as such would not be using the citibike service anymore. SO glad I did not fall for the discounted yearly membership pass offer that they extended to me after writing my first review - as who knows what hidden charges are incurred with that. Unfortunately I guess sometimes if it just seems like something is too good to be true, it's actually just too good to be true."

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/19/2014,"I'm a first time user tourist from out of town.  After reading the web site and kiosk, I was under the impression I would be charged approx $10.00 for 24 hours.. Big mistake, I used a bike for about 7 hours and was charged $155.65 on my credit card. I telephoned NYCbike and they told me I did not properly read the pricing instructions. The front page of the web site seems to trick a person into believing he/she will only be charged $10.00 for 24 hours. The customer service reps basically told me ""tough rocks sucker!"""

We then tried to pick up our bikes again after going on a NYC City Tour and the machine wouldn't re-read our credit cards. So we called them and they were horribly rude and cursed at my 56 year old mother and called her a liar and said that our bike had been reported as STOLEN! Now they are charging us $1500 for a bike that's not even stolen! BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT USE CITI BIKE!!!"

I bought a day pass to test out the service. Got in with no problems through the park. It was pleasant! On my way home was a completely different story. Tried to dock my bike and saw the little green light, but saw nothing on my app and the meter kept running. I called citibike immediately to make sure I didn't get charged extra. They told me there was nothing they could do. The customer service reps were beyond rude. They were yelling at me and interrupting-- I'm the one on the hook for bogus charges. This is a total joke and an embarrassment. Walk instead. It's far more pleasant. And sneakers are a far better investment."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/20/2014,"24-hour-pass is NOT FOR USING 24 HOURS CONTINUOUSLY!I probably should blame ourselves on this but it is so confusing for a first time user who just travels around NYC and wants to use a bike soon. We checked out 3 bikes, and read 24-hour-pass... hey, using a bike within limits of 24 hours isn't so bad! We just need to wonder around a bit at Brooklyn. There is a station where NON of our credit cards can be read, and the docks are full so a lot of people are waiting to return the bike at the station whereas many people cannot check out bikes with their credit cards.But that's fine, we walked to another station (Columbia Heights & Cranberry St) and checked out the bike. We discussed about the route then had a lot of fun at Brooklyn. We finally decide to ride bike to grand central terminal! It is a 4h/17m/30s ride, within the 24 hour limit.Then the security deposit is never back. Not until I asked the customer service did I realize that there is an overcharge after every 30 minutes limit with in 24 hours!!So riding a very heavy and bad condition bike (without a lock) for a 4 hour ride cost us more than $100 each. What a great experience! It must be a genius to think up such a plan: promise a 24-hour pass, but you need to split your whole trip to small segments of 30 minutes, you must get to your destination and return the bike within that time. So if you need a bike in better condition, and don't want to have a 30 minute segmentation, just find a bike store or a rental bike service, that won't cost you that much and you get a better bike."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/15/2016,"Outstanding program.  I've used the bikeshares in Seattle Paris and Montreal and it compares favorably. My only complaint (and reason for not giving 5 stars) is that more effort needs to be made towards shifting bikes about.  Particularly in Montreal you see trailers moving bikes to where they are most needed. In Midtown at night its almost impossible to find a bike, or uptown to find a dock. The app works great to tell you where they are at but still, it can be really annoying. The concierge program is a great tool to mitigate against this."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/08/2017,Citi bike is a scam. I was in NYC last weekend thinking I could do a nice ride of Central Park and thought it was a great deal for a ride for only $12. No where was it clear to me that in order to have free rides you have to dock the bike back every 30 minutes. I ended up keeping the bike for about 2 hours and got charged the day fee plus the penalty. Shame on them for ripping honest tourists like myself off. I would have had a better price renting a bike from a bike shop. Buyers beware! You've been warned.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/24/2016,Horrid zero customer service will never use again charged for multiple bikes that i did not rent and the over charged for an additional 6 hours will never use again maybe it works for annual members

This became an issue when we rode up the West side Hwy because there are really no bike stands there so we had to come off by 85th street and ride down the busy streets to look for a stand...but outside of this it was fun!!!

It costs about $14 for the hour, which is sorta steep, but it was worth it since we had so much fun.  However, if it was something you see yourself doing more often, definitely get the yearly pass for $99, it will save you lots!"

NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/31/2017,Had a little trouble at first figuring out how it worked but that was due to my own tendency to ignore the details. Some experienced Citibike usersr helped me out and after that it was smooth pedalling. I didn't get penalized for going over the half hour per ride limit once thanks to the abundance of docking stations throughout the city and text alerts. it was oversll a great experience.
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/07/2013,"Update:  I have calmed down now that my key finally arrived. I feel very much like Mr. Sweetchuck in this scene from Police Academy whenever I'm riding a Citi Bike:  youtu.be/gGPde9vFoqcSo far, I have had two reactions from strangers watching me ride down the street on my Citi Bike. One dorky looking white guy tried to high-five me and said, ""yeah baby, Citi Bikes!""  Then a couple days afer, an angry looking black guy said to me as I cycled by, ""look at you all hard on your Citi Bike.""  Not sure what to make of any of this. But so far, my impressions are: The Good:1  .Being able to bike somewhere and then return the bike and not have to worry about locking it up and/or your bike getting stolen. Also, really like being able to bike one way and then take the subway or a cab the other way.  I also like biking for a while and then returning bike and jogging the rest of the way. 2.  Bikes are sturdy and the fat tires makes them more stable. 3.  Bikes don't go too fast so probably are safer. The Bad:1. These bikes are no fun to ride, are heavy, and don't go fast. Takes much longer to get from point A to point B, compared to my road bike. 2. Like i said, these bikes don't exude style...just a way to get around.3. Sometimes I return a bike, it locks into the dock, but I don't get a green light. This is unnerving. I wish you could use the app to see if they have the bike in their system as checked back in! (you can check the kiosk) 4. Skateboard PUNKS (I can say that, as I used to read Thrasher back in the day). Fast forward to angry old man me, and I have to say, I don't like how every 10 seconds these morons lose control of their boards and they go flying into the people on their Citi Bikes!5.  People on bikes are oblivious to other bikers and without mirrors there are going to be a lot of accidents revolving around passing."

I've sent more than 10 emails to them, and the fact that I literally get the same exact responses is nothing short of pathetic. They don't really care about their customers, and those copied and pasted responses clearly show that. They will tell that they re-balance the stations and are trying to improve the system, but after a year it only gets worse and I'm still waiting to see any station in the entire city getting re-balanced, just like the 30+ other users I've asked and also said they've never seen it. It's a lie and very disrespectful to their customers who are paying for a service that they can't use when they most need it.I won't be surprised if the bikes and stations start getting vandalized..."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/11/2014,"This is by far the worst bike sharing system I have ever used.  Between broken machines and bikes it's pretty much a crapshoot if you will be able to use it.  The sad thing is I used the bike sharing system in DC, which was made by the same vendor, and experienced none of these issues.  The idea is great and it works well in other cities, but New York just completely botched the execution."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/01/2014,"I wish I could give no star or even a negative star, if possible.  This review is specifically about their customer service & membership processes.  I paid for the annual membership over a month and a half ago and still have not received my member key.  I called in three times to at least get some updates on the status and no one gave me any details and kept saying I need to wait longer.  Also, they refused to take any action when I called in the third time (30 days after the purchase date) regardless of the abnormal delay on the delivery.Apparently what they say on the e-mail you get after paying for your annual membership is NOT TRUE.  When I got the e-mail, they said the member key should arrive within 3-5 business days.  When I called in after a week, they did NOT even send out the key yet.  I paid for my membership on Oct. 22 and my key was not sent out until Oct. 29.  I called in again a week after the day they declared they sent out and they told me to wait and call back if the key doesn't arrive within another week.  I waited for another 10 days and called in to check up on the status and ask if they can re-send the key and the only answer I got was wait till Friday evening, since it was Wednesday when I called.  (What kind of logic is this?)  I just gave up on arguing with them any more and decided to wait until I come back from Thanksgiving break.And... guess what? It's Dec. 1 and I still haven't got the key.  I'm done dealing with their failure with delivering what they advertised & promised and their terrible customer service.  I just sent out an email to their Customer Service and asked for a refund.  I liked the idea of Citi Bike, but I'm just going to ride on my own bike, since this is causing more trouble already than riding on my own.One last thing to add...  LOOK AT REVIEWS BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PAY FOR THE ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP.  I overlooked reviews about customer service and I'm deeply regretting that I ignored."

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/01/2016,"Absolutely awful service! The kiosk is very unclear. It's absurd that you can only rent the bike for 30 min. Before you need to return the bike or be charged $4 per 15 minutes. $12 to rent a bike for 30min seems a bit high, on top of $4/15min. But I guess I should expect this from a bank, not here to help, just here to rip off more hard working people! Please rent from a local shop, they have better bikes."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/08/2014,"Great concept, mess of an operation.I love using bikes to get around the city. Citibike however is a terrible company.Here's why broken docks, broken machines that don't print receipts, and arbitrary late fees.I AM CURRENTLY DISPUTING A $108 LATE FEE THAT I DID NOT INCUR. I check to make sure the light turns green when I dock my bike each and every time. If it does not turn green I call a service agent. Citibike has a record of me calling pretty much every day.The day they are charging me the late fee for was a day that I used the bike twice. They have it on record that I called about the earlier trip because the light didn't turn green. They are claiming I had the same problem with my evening trip, that the bike wasn't docked. I call every time. As was proven earlier in the day. The is no way for the customer to prove that they docked the bike except call every trip and print out a receipt every trip. I do call so that proved a fail. I tried printing a receipt but the machine was broken. Also they never informed me or billed me about a late fee until 3 weeks after the incident.So basically Citibike can arbitrarily bill you late fees (and they will) and there is not way for the customer to prove that they are right. Also, the service agents are not helpful, are often rude when there is a problem and seem comfortable scamming customers.My credit card company is currently disputing this fee (as they have done in the past) and I am going to contact the Better Business Bureau today and report Citibike. I encourage all others who have been charged late fees wrongly to do the same.If anyone wants to file a complaint against Citibike to the Better Business Bureau, here is their official address (Citibike does not make it easy to find this info)CITIBIKE aka NYC BIKE SHARE77 COMMERCIAL STREETBROOKLYN, NY 11222718 237 2878"

Coincidentally, the $100 I spend on a yearly Citi Bike membership was worth its weight in garbage. Here are the issues:1. terrible technology, unreliable system. Docking might not work. Checking out an available bike is even more difficult.2. In high traffic areas you are almost guaranteed:2a. Never find a free bike when you need one2b. Never find a free dock when you need one.3. Broken seats, broken peddles, flat tires run rampant. 4. I live on the upper east side. still no CitiBike 1 year on...My advice: find a cheap bike and buy a thick U-Lock.

The checking in every 30 minutes is a joke because it stresses you out trying to make sure you obey their rules. So back to my card not working. I tried to find an agent to help me like they did when I first rented the bike and gave them my money. Nope, only credit card stands. I called for help and waited on the phone for appx 5 minutes for someone to help. They made me use my credit card again to get a paper code to manually plug in numbers and I knew in the back of my mind it was not going to be good. I had to call them twice because the first set of numbers didn't work the second time. Well, come to find out I had to put my credit card in each time to receive new numbers. Really?  Yep, they charged me for exceeding the 30 minutes...twice. So will I ever do that again? Not on your life. I should have had a clue when the bikes were Citibank owned. I have never had a good Citibank experience."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/21/2017,"Worst experience ever! I will never use these bikes again, a cab is much cheaper and convenient. You need to use a battering ram and multiple attempts to dock this bulky over priced 30 minute ride. Even though you hear a click and think you've docked your bike, they will continue to charge you excess fees at the rate of $16.00 per hour. I had to drive an hour back to the city to re-dock a bike that had been sitting for over 5 hours in the same docking station. I'd give this review a zero if it were allowed"

NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/08/2014,"What a very fun surprise!! Biking in Manhattan!! I thought it was a crazy idea at first but after we figured out the un-docking process the fun began. Who knew that biking in Manhattan at 10PM on a Sunday night would prove to be such a good idea?!  Down load the app for your phone and set the timer.  IT's a blast!  Half the fun is looking for the next docking station.  The true test came Monday - a work day after Thanksgiving...so much more traffic.  While it's chaotic, the upside is that the traffic rarely moves very fast.  Great fun!! I highly recommend.  A great way to see, smell, and hear the city!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/11/2016,If you need a bike for 30 mins it's fine otherwise look elsewhere. We used them thru Central Park but you have to put them back every 30 minutes and the docking places are outside the park so you need to constantly be aware of time. We spent 1 hour and 45 mins we were late because we got lost in the park and was charge $26 for the 2 bikes then another $35 in overages. We could have rented other bikes for the day with helmets and locks for the same price. It was a rip off. Also you have to change your code for every new bike every 30 mins and put your credit card back in. That's if there are anybikes left and you have to wait 10 mins inbetween
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/02/2015,"This is ridiculous this is my first time and also will be last time in my life I ever use a citi bike. I got charge $50 for a 2.5 use!?!?!  The renting station is very confusing. Just read up some review knowing I am not the only one having this problem. We all thought $9.95 is for 24hr of use, but no you got to dock in your bike every 30min to stay to the $10 or you get will a overtime fee for every 30min this is so frustrating!!!!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/08/2016,"Unreasonable program where ""24 hour"" rental can still lead to overage charges! There is a requirement of re docking the bike every 30 mins, if it isn't redocked within that time frame, there are ""overtime"" fees associated. After re-docking the bike, the renter is required to use the terminal again and take out another bike code, for the same bikes that were just returned.None of this is clearly explained in the tiny, rushed atmosphere of renting locations. As a first time rider looking to explore the city, these kinds of requirements should be repeatedly, and clearly shown. I don't quite understand the requirement anyway as this is advertised as a convenient way of exploring the city, but how convenient is hunting down a docking station every 30 mins? My maybe 3 hour ride with 2 bikes ended up costing $25.68 for 2 bikes, plus overtime fees of $42.80 for each bike, totaling $111.28. I should have gotten on craigslist and bought 2 cheap bikes for that cost. The quality of the bike is subpar at best. They are heavy and hard to yield. Seat is uncomfortable to ride on for more than 10 mins. My wife had troubles trying to get on the bike on the lowest seat setting. She is about average height and has ridden plenty of other rental bikes without any issues. My overall experience was totally not worth it, and the final ""overtime"" charges will keep me away for good. Hopefully they get rid of these gotcha charges because the overall idea is great but implementation needs work."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/31/2014,"I am a fan of the Citi Bike program and NYC's bike lanes in general.  I give it four stars just for EXISTING, where other cities have nothing.  As someone who commutes via bicycle 40+ miles a day on the city streets of Los Angeles, I think the existence of this rental bike program, and the accompanying culture of biking that exists in New York, is fantastic.Is the program perfect?  Certainly not.  The computer kiosks are not at all intuitive for first-timers or out-of-towners.  You have to request a new ride code each time you want to get a bike, by first pressing ""request new ride code,"" and then inserting your (same) credit card.  Pull up your bike to a station that's full of bikes, just before your time is up?  Requesting more time via the kiosk is also extremely un-intuitive.  You might also find yourself wasting time trying to dock your bike at a dock that is... broken.  Which can add pressure if you are trying to cut it close up against your time limit.  So, not perfect.  The Citi Bike smartphone app is useful for find the numerous stations throughout the city.  The bikes I used were in good working order, and despite having come unprepared, I put in 20 miles wearing my Allen Edmonds dress shoes I enjoyed riding around the city so much.  The bike lanes in New York feel  safe-ish (if you watch for car doors and pedestrians) and there is a general feeling that bikes have a place on the city streets here, or at least more so than in other places.  Cars look out for bikes (more often than I am used to), and don't make deliberate attempts to kill you.I imagine this program has a 2.5 star review average because of how the kiosks and docks function (or, rather, how they don't function).  That's too bad, but don't let it discourage you from trying it out!"
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,07/06/2014,"I have very mixed feelings about these bikes. On the surface they seem like a very good idea and it is nice to be able to zip around the city on a bike. However be sure not to have the bike for longer than 30 mins or else you are smacked with a ""late fee"" and then 45 mins late from dipping your bike you get hit with another fee. These rules are extremely confusing at first but once you ride around for a few hours it is more understandable. I felt like the entire time I was riding, it was like a race against time, there wasn't a whole lot of ""let's enjoy this scene"". Instead it is ""where is the next station with a kiosk"", and that is another thing you only can grab a bike from a station with a kiosk or else your walking. Someone needs to go back to the drawing board and fix how this thing is operated."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/24/2015,"Their bloodsucking policy is the worst. They advertise this as a way to reach from point A to point B, however you have only half an hour to do that. As a tourist I failed to check in a bike in such a short time because a. there was no spot on one docking station and b. it can take much longer than half an hour to find one, especially if you are new to the city."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/20/2014,"I wish I could rate this higher- as I am a founding member and have wanted something like this for AGES. The problem is that the system is really unreliable...from there NEVER being bikes available in midtown Manhattan when I need them, to the app showing half full icons on docks that only have 2 available bikes- both of which are usually broken- to a general lack of cleanliness, these problems have plagued this system since the get go. There are always a ton of bikes at Port Authority and Penn Station, but no one uses them. They need to be rebalanced onto Broadway and 8th Avenue but they never are. The system is pretty irritating and good luck when you find a bike that works or are returning it- no guarantee the dock will work at all."

NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/06/2015,"A fantastic concept that is being badly let down by execution.I ride the citibikes almost everyday but there are a number of issues that need to be addressed before they continue with their expansion.1) the docking stations probably 40%-50% of them seem to be broken and you cannot dock your bike.2)The bikes are not being serviced with brake pads needing to be replaced, bikes having no bells and gearing broken on bikes.3) the grips are degradable which means you end up with this black rubber on her hands after every ride.4) bikes are not being replenished at stations (there should be a crew that can see if a station is empty then more bikes need to be delivered likewise if a station is full then take some bikes away.)If the managing company could resolve there services it would be a 5 stars but sadly they don't seem to be interested in resolving these issues but more concerned about emails on expansion."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/06/2016,"I love it. I signed up for the annual membership, and a month in it has paid for itself in my mind. Since moving to midtown, I rarely need to use the subway, but walking everywhere can take a chuck of time out of your (my) day, and that's how Citibike has really made an impact on my day-to-day life. My 30 minute walk to work, can be 10 minutes, if I want it to be, by hopping on a bike. I love that I don't own the bike, so I never worry about theft or maintainence. The only draw back is that in certain areas of the city at certain times of the day or night, I often catch the dicks completelt empty of bikes.  I get it, but it means riding instead of walking is not  a 100% certain thing, but so far, it's enough to make it very worthwhile for me. However, I now need to carry hand cleaner at all times."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/22/2013,"CAUTION: NO FEE APPEAL PROCESSLessons from Citi Bike: Any fee that you will incur, even if they are due to station/bike malfunction, will not be refunded - despite a supposed appeal process. After purchasing 2 one-day passes, I was charged $102 in late fees even though I did return the bikes on time. Upon contacting their call center, Vera Thompson - the office manager - refused to right the wrong. Disregarding my intentions to use Citi Bike again if she simply would correct the error, Ms. Thompson hung up the phone refusing to consider my request. She stated that I had misread the services agreement.After getting run over by Ms. Thompson and two of her office associates, I would NEVER trust this service again.

NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/15/2015,"While I understand some of the other reviewer's complaints, I thankfully had no issues using Citi Bike! I went to NYC this past weekend (Friday-Monday) and wanted to get a lot of sightseeing done. I knew that taking cabs or uber everywhere would cost a lot, but that walking would take up time and put a toll on my body. I was excited to see that there was Citi Bike, as I've used them in Miami.I signed up for a week-long pass, as I needed a solid 3 days of use. I stayed at the Waldorf, which was pretty centrally located and had a docking station at 52nd and Lexington that always had a fews bikes available and plenty of open docks for dropoffs. From here I biked pretty much everywhere throughout the weekend. What's important to remember is that these are meant to be commuting bikes so that is why only the first 30 minutes is included in your pass. Knowing this, I would purposely map out bike stations to switch out my bike whenever I knew that I'd be going for more than 30 minutes. This system never failed me. The only time I rode for more than 30 minutes was when I wanted to stroll through Central Park. I knew that I would be charged a surcharge, but honestly it only ended up being just under $5 so that was totally worth it. Overall, this was a great system for me. I usually arrived in to my destinations in about half the amount of time that it took my friends to walk or take cabs (they didn't feel safe riding in the streets with traffic). Just keep in mind, that I did most of my riding over the weekend, where I likely didn't have to deal with nyc commuters looking for bikes.They did place a $100 security deposit on my credit card; however, it only was a pending charge and never processed."

We rode from the East to West side, and then back to Columbus Circle via River Side Drive to return the bikes. I awoke to discover I was charged $125.99.

I challenged them again and was told that a supervisor would phone me with 48 hours.  No call.

NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/19/2016,Used to be a casual user of Citi Bike - as I travel frequently yearly membership wasn't necessary but weekly 'rental' for $25 was good value and encouraged me to use the scheme.But now they've done away with the weekly rental ($24 for 3 days is way too expensive) I never use it.Other schemes in cities around the world are much more affordable and actually encourage people to cycle rather than crowd transportation - which I thought was the whole point.London is £2 ($3)/day!!! This should't be a profit making scheme! Much cheaper and more convenient to simple buy a bike - even if it gets stolen after a few weeks - still works out cheaper!

Will NEVER use this service again and I hope at least some people see this and can choose wiser transportation because of it."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/23/2013,I give it a five star because I've experienced a similar system and loved that system as much and I want to offset some of the angrier reviews. Let me set you straight on what to expect:Watch for:1) Red lights. That means the bike docked there will not come out.2) Make sure the green light goes on when you return your bike.3) FULL Kiosks of bikes. That means that no one was able to pull out a bike from there.4) Empty Kiosks of bikes. That means too many people come there and the bike you just docked will be snatched by someone else while you wait on line to get your next five digit code.Do this:1) Preplan your route a little bit so that you can not worry about the 30 minute limit.2) Choose a bike already adjusted to your height. Those seats are not that easy to adjust.3) Use the app. It is actually moderately accurate and it helps you find your way to the next kiosk.These bikes are good for what they are. They are a great way to travel around the city and enjoy the sites without worrying about your bike being stolen. You just dock it instead of locking it. Want to just pick up from another kiosk? Sure! I can't wait for this whole place to be full of kiosks. Bike more! It's good for you. Let's all work together to develop a common bike culture that is POLITE! Don't be a Jerk. Don't be THAT biker.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/11/2015,"What a FARCE!!!! Basically, they make you think you're renting a bike for 24hrs for $10, but in reality you can only use it for 30 min increments over the next day. We used a couple bikes for 2 hours and got charged $100. It's worth adding that I'm the type that takes my time reading basic terms or directions thoroughly when it comes to anything, and they certainly got me. They need to do a much better job of clearly conveying their business model, because the perceived bait-and-switch method is not going to be sustainable, regardless of their intentions. Surprised Citi would want their name associated with such a poorly reviewed service."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/08/2015,"NEVER EVER AGAIN. These people should be sued for false advertising. They lie and try to take advantage of you. DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY. Its NOT 9.95 for 24 hours. Its 9.95 AND THEN they will nickel and dime you with ridiculous charges. If you bike for more than 30 minutes expect to be robbed. Who bikes in 30 minutes increments?! Tell me who?!? Citi bike has a horrible, very greedy and just plain criminal business model. I don't understand how they are allowed to operate. Currently they are holding 100 dollars of MY money for ""8 business days"" for ""service charges"" WHAT A SCAM. I should have just bought a bike at this rate. SCAM ARTISTS!!!!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,11/29/2013,"Citi Bike is a great transit option at a great price.   For $99 a year, I can now commute by bike cheaper than any other transit option besides walking.  For what repairs to my personal bike cost, it's even cheaper than riding my own.  Docking stations are convenient to almost all of Manhattan below 59th St.  I have not had a hard time finding a bike more than once or twice, and I've always ended up finding one without too much difficulty.  The bikes themselves are durable, but bulky three-speed touring bikes.  On my racing bike I can make it from 34th Street to South Ferry in 17 minutes -- on Citi Bike: 35 minutes.  On my bike I'm faster than a subway -- on Citi Bike I must allow a few extra minutes.  The upside of a slower, heavier bike is that it's a bit safer, and a better work out.  It's also a shame that they haven't worked the bikes into the park system yet.  Above Stuyvesant H.S. there are not bikes on the waterfront in Hudson River Park and there are not bikes in Central Park (which is above 59th).  Upper Manhattan needs access to Citi Bike.  Also, Lower Manhattan can only be accessed by the perimiter; there are no functional bike routes through the Financial District.  Most of the reserved bike lanes are a joy to ride.  The shared lanes, especially on the more crowed streets, like Chinatown, can be harrowing.  Also, above 34th Street, even the dedicated lanes can be overrun by pedestrians, push carts and skateboarders - easier to stick to the rivers.The 45 minute thing doesn't bother me.  Doesn't stop me from re-docking every half hour to keep the bike as long as I need.  It does prevent people from taking the bike out of commission all day when it should be circulating.  (If you plan to picnic, dock your bike and pick up a fresh ride later.)Overall, I'm an instant fan.  Citi Bike is my new normal.  I'll even ride as often as I can force myself through the winter.  There is no better way to enjoy and access Manhattan from the Battery to Midtown."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/25/2013,"Well I will upgrade my review to 2 stars, Now the ""Fat Jew"" (comedian)  gives the  homeless  a  cycling  class to lose weight. That is  a plus! youtube.com/watch?v=leTiYelp took down my original review they will probably take this down too! Someone at Yelp is obsessed with flagging me instead of doing good reviews or making sure Elites have pictures up or something along those lines they are obsessed with flagging my reviews. Anyway check out the video it's hilarious!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/24/2013,"I really like Citi Bike.I think this program is great for the City.Let me start by saying that it is VERY annoying to lose parking on the streets.  Let me also say that I am against any plan to take cars out of the city.  This review is about Citibike.  Not about mayoral plans, and people's demons.That being said, I have been quite annoyed about the difficulty in finding parking since they have taken spots away in the East Village for bike racks.  As a result, I have had to have my car parked elsewhere many times.  This has caused some delay in my getting to the office at times.Such being the case, I have decided to get a Citi Bike membership and use the Bikes to get around during the day.I got an annual membership.  The delay in receiving my key was serious.  I waited several weeks.  Though they were giving out keys in Union Square park, I was told I had signed up several days too late to get a key from the nice people at the table.I later in the program with others used a daily pass.  This was a huge source of frustration as many of the card readers don't work properly.  Sometimes, you have to walk to another Citibike Station.My annual pass uses a key fob which I can put into a slot and get a bike.  So far, with this exception of two stations, this has worked amazingly well.  I have taken approximately 25 trips to date and this program is FANTASTIC.  I find that most of the people with opinions of the program, have not actually immersed themselves in the experience of it.The west side highway bike paths are amazing.  On a sunny day, you can go from battery park to the intrepid.  At 10pm, you can do the same.  It is AMAZING.  You can stop.  You can hop from place to place.  It is truly an amazing way to enjoy the city.  The best part is, you don't have to spend anything over your membership fee.  Such being the case, I found that the weekends that I used Citibike, I actually saved a significant amount in transportation costs.Also, I often would not just ride from one street to another.  I would go on bike adventures and dock for five minutes before continuing on.  The 30 minute day pass makes that a little annoying but the 45 minute annual pass fits just right.  You can get a long way in 40 minutes before worrying about a dock.I took a star off the five because there are still glitches in the system and the equipment.  However, it was a great experience and I really did not have an open mind going in.  I still hate losing parking.  I still get annoyed when the red light flashes rather than the green.  It gives me pause when my bike locks but I get no confirmation from a green light saying that I can leave and the docking process has completed.  However, the benefits if you really make an effort to enjoy the bikes, far outweigh the minuses.  I plan to take a trip to Brooklyn this week (from Manhattan on the bikes) and will update this review if necessary.The other major concern I have has to do with poor people in this City.  I do not have a magic answer, but though the Citibike program is in public housing developments (There are bikes in public housing, even behind my mother's apartment), there is not a system in place for poor people to use the bikes.  The last sentence is not entirely accurate (there is a discounted annual cost for NYCHA residents and members of certain credit unions).  In theory, these mechanisms are sufficient for gaining access to the program.  However, a survey I have taken of several public housing residents (people I know) has really uncovered not just antagonism to the program (which seems to stem from media portrayals of the program) but actual frustration in the fact that they don't have the ability to try it.  I know it is a Citibank sponsored program, but many economically challenged people do not have bank accounts.  Further, even if the events planned in these developments include the ability to sign up for free accounts which will allow for participation, many of the events are scheduled for July, which will logistically mean missing another 20-30 days of riding for people who will then have to wait for a debit card and subsequently a bike key.  I don't have a magic answer, but I believe if this is supposed to be a public service, the time is now to use the system to help empower those who may be locked out due to economic hardship to overcome those obstacles.  I personally don't believe the program has any duty to do these things, but I believe that the opportunity to help people do more than ride a bike has presented itself.  The program should work to better implement in communities in which this program would empower people to get to work, school, and new opportunities for less money than a metrocard."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/02/2013,"Once upon a time, on a crappy day, my boyfriend and I decided to rent some bikes and try to have some fun in the city. The machine screen took forever to work properly and we had to get 3 tickets because the codes werent working.   After 15- min, we finally got our bikes and started to happily ride them, we were a little worried about the time, so we found another station and returned our bikes.   For our surprise, when we tried to take new bikes out, we werent able to! All bikes were displaying red lights after we inserted the code and we ended up going back home and deciding not to rent a bike ever again from citibike."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/14/2017,so far very good experience! loved to ride my first time! :)  absolutely recently recommended! ride safe!
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/28/2013,"After a few weeks I have to downgrade my review down to one star.  There are just way too many glitches in the system, and as more and more people have signed up there are way too many empty/full racks and not enough rebalancing teams moving bikes around as necessary.The only improvement they've made is adding capacity to the support hotline, instead of waiting 45 minutes to speak to someone you now never have to wait more than 30s."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/14/2013,"First off, the options are confusing. IF I have a 24hr pass does that mean I can keep the bike for 24 hrs? or does that mean that I have to still keep docking it to keep using it? When will there be a single ride option? 10.00 + 101.00 debit card hold is ridiculous if you just want to try it out. How is this not CHEAPER than the train or the bus? Why is it not available or any planned stations further than 60th street? So again the upper part of Manhattan gets the shit stick. I would have loved this program if there was a single ride option - CHEAPER than the train or bus. And if there were stations near me * upper 110's*. Now I get perhaps that they are placing them with more populated areas... but see, then why have you torn up my streets to put in fucking MILES of bike lanes with no intention of placing something like this near them? hmmm.... and I think placing a 101.00 HOLD on your card kinda eliminates the common person that barely is making ends meet, which the bikes would have helped them. Alot of people still use CASH ( I don't as much but I do know my neighborhood is mostly all CASH only places).in any case. Love the idea, but will see how the working get developed."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/03/2013,"I'll wade into the subjective waters on this, since Grant's review perfectly sums up the facts and details of the bike share. I don't mind getting opinionated on something I love this much--after all, we're on Yelp.After using the Bixi bike share system in Montreal two years back for an entire vacation (literally, we took them everywhere we needed to go), I was 100% sold on bike shares and having a program in NYC. I waited and prayed, and although I'm never one to salivate over huge corporations slapping their name all over a good thing, I was ecstatic when I found out NYC was going to get a large-scale bike share. It's a profoundly easy, healthy, affordable, and beautiful way to see any city, but especially one as crowded as New York. Subways get aggressively packed and torturous in the warm weather, driving means a constant game of ""which streets are impassable,"" and riding my own cycle means always worrying about damage, theft, and finding a legit bike rack. Walking is a wonderful means to get around the city, but cycling is really my ideal method of moving from point A to point B. You can stop whenever you want, you can be fast, slow, on time, late, it's all up to you. You cover more ground. And a bike share enables you to reap all the benefits of riding a bike in a city without any of the worry about carrying a lock and stressing about coming back to a stripped frame. I took my first ride this past weekend, from the 34th street ferry pier down to Wall street, and it was fantastic. I was transported back to my vacation in Montreal--no worrying about train lines or walking 10 miles, just pure cycle transportation. We definitely ran into a few hiccups--one station by Liberty and Broadway was totally non-functional, another by Battery Park City gave us red lights on our fresh pass-codes until we retried the whole process from the start. And our final docking point at west 14th street gave me a yellow light but wouldn't let me remove and re-dock the bike. But in the end we figured it all out, and I'm still 100% supportive of this program. Will Citi Bike mean the removal of some local bike racks? Probably. The loss of valuable parking spots? Absolutely. The fiery-eyed malice of some NIMBY residents? You already know. But once we get past the initial kinks, this will be a perfect addition to NYC's intricate transportation network--it will bridge commute gaps and allow everyone to see their city in a new (and, I believe, better) way. My one real suggestion is that they increase the time for both pass and member riders by 15 minutes each (making it 45 for pass-holders and 1 hour for members...NYC is a big place).Here are my PRO-TIPS for newcomers:- Download the ""City Bikes"" and ""Ride the City"" apps for station locations and best routes. The Citi Bike app kind of sucks and is quite crash-prone.- Always check over the bike(s) BEFORE paying/undocking. This way you'll have a winner without starting your timer (passes get 30-minute trips, annual members get 45-minutes per ride). This means checking the tires for good pressure, the bell, brake tension, seat height (remember your number for future rides) and spinning the wheels to make sure they're not bent or have locked-up brakes.- Plan your route before undocking to avoid dreaded u-turns and stops that lead to late fees on your trip- Lift the bike back from underneath the saddle and pull back on the handlebars to undock. Use a bit of force to knock it back into the dock when finished- Make good use of your bell, stay away from driver-side car doors, always stop at red lights (and avoid the $200 ticket I once had to pay), and never swerve through crowds of people.- Be patient and open-minded. This is a new thing for NYC, and it takes some time to make it all work smoothly. Don't hate the whole idea of a bike share just because you have a few problems here and there--it'll get sorted out soon enough.- Wear a helmet. Seriously. Even if you think it's ridiculous. Better yet, if you're laughing right now, go to a LBS to get fitted for your proper size because I'm certain you have no idea how to wear one properly."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,11/04/2015,"This may be a useful service for those in town for a few days, but I would recommend just going to a local business. I tried to use it for commuting to work but after two weeks had so many technical difficulties I had to go back to public transportation. Two days ago I got a broken bike, docked at the next station and was told I had to wait 2 minutes before renting another bike. Ten minutes later I still couldn't get a new bike and had to walk another ten minutes to the next station, making me late for work. Today I docked my bike, got the ""green light"" that it was secure, then four hours later received an email that my bike hadn't been returned. The customer service rep insisted I hadn't gotten a green light. Curious how they are so confident in their technology when they must know all the issues that people are having."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,11/04/2015,"This could be a great thing but poor customer service and logistics are not letting it live up to it's potential. I use Citibike around Manhattan and as part of my daily commute. Unfortunately, there are issues with getting the bikes where they need to be. There are at least 6 docks within 2 blocks of Penn Station. When getting in to Penn Station before 7am I should be able to find a bike closer than the 6 blocks I have to walk regularly. When attempting to return them in the West Village or East Side I find where all the bikes actually are as it's difficult to find an empty dock to drop off. Emails and calls to the customer service line go without a response. Very unfortunate that such a spectacular idea is being so terribly mismanaged."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,12/30/2013,"Oh Citi Bike, was there a more polarizing program over the past year?There's still so much that has to be tweaked with this bike sharing program, but I still stand firm in believing that we are saving the planet and helping people get around a little easier by having it available to us. The biggest problem for me is still the lack of docking stations. It's just not practical to get to a station and not have an open dock to leave the bike! Even if the research shows less demand in certain areas, you need to think ahead and add more docks there anyway! Many folks are using these bikes to get to work and it's an added stress to get there and have to wait for a spot to open or scour the area for another station. Please add more docks in more locations, including parts of Brooklyn, and this will eventually be 5 stars because it's a GREAT idea. It stays at 3 for now as a tourist attraction and not a guarantee for people who live here and rely on it as a form of transportation...You can't keep every irresponsible rider from getting on one of these, so I'm not factoring in the hazard they bring to the road, but with adjustments over time this will be a great addition to our city."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/29/2014,"I think this is a great service. So many stations and for short journeys of 30mins or less it was great. There were times that the bikes wouldn't come out, there were times where the racks were full or empty, but at the end of the day we got by. We also saw some people stealing the bikes by lifting them up and out of the holders. I hope they fix this so that prices stay low. Also they need to improve their App. It doesn't centre to where you are, and the direction function doesn't work on my iPhone 6plus. Overall riding around nyc was the highlight of the trip (aside from getting engaged!)."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/23/2013,Amazing idea with very poor execution. Stations malfunction with glitches and many bikes display red lights meaning something is wrong with them. Recently spent nearly 2 hours going to 5 different stations trying to rent bikes with a friend.I purchased the one-year membership and I'm considering getting a refund.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,11/05/2014,"believe it or not, dependng on where you are & time, depends if you get a bike, and depending on where you are & time , depends if you get parking for the bike!!! Especially DOWNTOWN NYC! Bit problematic however the idea is amazing and must give props to that."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,02/14/2014,"4.5 round up.  Oh the subway money you save...Aside from the $$ saved (which you can then use on food and drink!!!), Citibike provides a practical, healthy way of transportation. I'm lucky and found a great deal - $50 for a year - on Gilt.  Citi Bike saves me the anxiety of having my own bike locked up outside, and lights on the bikes ensures that I have a safer night ride.  There are definite downsides, such as certain empty docks during morning hours when people are commuting to work, but over these couple months they've become pretty diligent on relocating bikes from full stations to empty ones.  If you need to dock a bike but arrive at a full one, you can get an extra 15 min. or so to find another dock.  The downside is that some docks just don't lock and you have no choice but to try another one.  What's most appealing is the amazing customer service.  I've encountered an array of problems including arriving at a dock only to discover it's boxed in by 3 feet of snow, or my key card doesn't work.  I don't know who trains them, but the call center people are the calmest, kindest call center people ever.  One thing I wish they would do is set up more docks in the Greenpoint area, where the food and art scene is growing.  I'd have to bike over a bridge to get there but....it still beats taking the G Train ;)"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/10/2015,"What a deceptive pricing structure.  $9.95 for unlimited 24 hours???  Oh, but you have to stop and turn the bike in every 30 minutes or you pay exorbitant fees.  Hard to believe this is legal.  I hope once the word gets out, they will have to make a change.  I paid the 9.95 plus an additional $13.00 for 45 minute overage.  I could care less about the money, it's the fact that this was not clearly disclosed at the bike station.  I'll rent from the bike vendors that rent from the closets before I ever give CitiBikes my money."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/06/2015,"Citibikes works fairly well overall.  But for users who rely on Citibikes for commuting, fairly well is not enough.  I began using the bikes for my commute from Grand Central to downtown Manhattan.  For the first year, no real problems.  This year, no bikes at Grand Central. Not one at the over 100 available bike racks at Pershing Square North and South. Not on 43rd and Vanderbilt. Not at any stations nearby. I have emailed and called in numerous complaints, but it has not helped.  The customer service center, located in North Carolina apparently, can only send emails to the ""re-balancing"" unit, same as the customers.  Its a shame because I see approximately 10 bikers scrambling around looking for bikes each day to get to their jobs.  Citibikes is losing customers, not gaining them.   Today, for example, I checked the app and website starting at 5 a.m.  I stopped at 7:30 a.m, no bikes were restocked at Grand Central during that time period.  How can Citibikes hope to be in existence if the busiest bike racks in the city are not stocked during rush hour? Not having bikes at Grand Central during the morning commute is just insane.Sounds like the program is self-sabotaging intentionally.  Maybe the powers that be do not want the program around."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/01/2014,This concept and company is awesome!!! So easy to use and cheap . Cost 9.95 for a day and so worth it . I'm visiting my from Cali and between the trains and buses it gets expensive . Great deal and you get to see so much more of the city with them . Multiple locations and they have an app for the iPhone so you and find drop off locations all over the place !!! I will defiantly be using this company forge remainder of my stay and the next time I come back !!! Awesome idea !!!
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/15/2015,Total rip off. Very unclear information on that you basically have to bring back your bike every 30 minutes before ending up with charges of crazy fees on the bikes. We've only rented 2 bikes for about 2 hours and being charged crazy amount of money. Never again!!Unfortunate to see that companies trying to make money by ripping off people.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/06/2013,"I took my first Citibike out today from 51st & 5th to Union Square and it was a blast.  I had no trouble finding a spot to park my bike at the docking station (16th & 5th).  I wish there was some kind of paper that spit out of the machine to give you your passcode.  Other than that, I'm excited about the option to ride a bike.  It took me only 15 minutes to get to Union Square.  The bike is very heavy but that's to be expected since they have to be sturdy.  It's definitely not very nimble but I enjoyed my ride and I got my heart rate up.  I've ridden my bike all over Manhattan when I lived in the city and like then, the biggest challenge is pedestrians.  They're just not looking for bicycles so you have to be careful but that has nothing to do with Citi Bike. An option to rent a helmut might  be a good idea."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/30/2015,This is such a stupid concept. All it does is waste parking spaces. You can't use the bike more than 30 minutes with out absurd over charge fees. Why not have a program to rent for Leisure riding since if you are a tourist that is convenient ..As always in New York- nothing is easy and you spend half hour time on phone with customer service .. Either get rid of program or make it useful
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/24/2013,"I like Citibike, easy way to get around, great cheap yearly plan, easiest way to get across town, it is great, EXCEPT... when you are a few minutes from home and every rack is full in the East Village!  I went around for an extra 25 minutes looking for a rack to park the bike, I went to 6 racks in the area and found nothing, and the ones that were available did not work.  Oh well... still a work in progress but I'm still a fan.And to the little punk putting dirty sticky stuff on the seats of all the Citibikes in the East Village, karma will catch up to you!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/24/2016,"Long overdue that I update this review.  They made all the changes I wished for and more.   Theyve implemented valet system to deal with overcrowded docks, they've improved docking with beeps so you know it worked.  They've dramatically improved coverage all over the city including in Williamsburg.  The annual cost increased to $160 but that is worth every penny.  It has saved me thousands on cab rides and given me the super power of being able to cut accross town in traffic jams in minutes.   Its given me breezy pleasure rides all over the city.  Its allowed me the peace of mind to know I can get the 30 blocks from my office to my son's school in an emergency in 10 minutes, a trip that would be 20 minutes by cab and 30 by public transit.    Its given me the option of a quick 2 minute ride up to the L train instead of the usual plodding 8 minute walk.   Its given me the convenience of open jawed transit when I enjoy the downhill ride one way and not the uphill ride back :)   Instead of wandering around with my old bike looking for somewhere to lock it for 15 minutes and wrestling the$100  lock around it and still not knowing if it will be there when i get back, with citi i can just click it into place and forget about it.    I LOVE CITIBIKE!!!!!!  NOTE: This is a review of the ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP.  I dont have to deal with any nonsense like entering codes,  I have no interface with the screen.    I just have to dip the FOB and go.  I highly recommend the annual membership."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/13/2013,"I bought an annual membership in mid-June, and despite a warning about a 10-day wait, it arrived in exactly a week.  On my first day using Citibike I rode from eastern Prospect Heights to FiDi in Manhattan, and then to Bed Stuy.  The journey took me through 3 bikes, and a short subway ride because of a rain burst, but was overall a positive experience.  First, and for me a slight negative, is that these bikes are VERY heavy.  I've been riding in the city for about a year, and had a hard time initially mounting and steering the bike because of it's unusual weight.  Once I figured that out, it was relatively smooth sailing.  Because it did take so long to adjust to the bike, I found myself close to the 40 minute mark as I approached the Brooklyn Bridge, so I had to stop and swap out bikes near the bridge to avoid running over time.  But the swap was a breeze.On the way back from Manhattan, it started raining.  I had the freedom to just corral the bike into the Citi bike stand and jump on the subway.  The wait for the subway at Manhattan's Fulton street, quickly reminded me of what a drag it is to ride subways on the weekend.  Most of the train lines had been diverted because of weekend construction, and I had to wait on a too hot and too crowded 2/3 platform for what seemed like 20 minutes for a train.  Once in Brooklyn, I stopped at Trader Joes @ Atlantic and Court Streets.  I would eager to see if my single paper bag of groceries would fit into the Citibike basket.  I was able to just squeeze it in there, and ride a Citibike home."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/11/2015,"Since they updated the stations' systems my experience has been much better. In the past, I would struggle to take bikes out or return them to the stations' slots. Many slots would be broken and I would frequently get a red light while trying to take bikes out. Now, I don't really have that problem anymore, but I am disappointed with the new bike designs. I can feel that the new bikes have much better brakes, which have drastically reduced stopping distance while retaining control (helps with close calls with tourists). However, the weight of the bikes remains unchanged. These bikes are so unbelievably heavy!!!!! They are ok on downhills and flat ground but even the slightest incline is sure to work up a sweat. Even moving them in or out of slots can be a workout. I also wish they could go faster, maybe a 4th gear? I am considering canceling my membership and buying my own bike due to the weight. It is really bothering me.Edit: I cancelled my membership. The bikes are just too freaking heavy, it's not pleasurable to ride. Even in third gear you'll be pedaling very hard yet the bike barely moves. It's just a pathetic design. Also, if you ever get in a dispute with them good luck. There's no way to appeal, they just take money out of your account. This will definitely lead to a lawsuit someday."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/19/2017,"Because I work later hours, there are usually no bikes available (although there were plenty when I first joined).  Complaints to CitiBike have been largely ignored and they won't let me out of my yearly contract, so I'm forced to pay every month for something that isn't even available to me.  Huge waste."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/08/2013,"I feel like I need to write two separate review for the two experience I had with Citi Bike.On day one we decided to try this out to get around as opposed to paying $2.50 every time we hopped on the subway. What we loved about this program is the designated bike lanes on the NY streets which made it safer to navigate all of the streets. Each station had a map that showed us what was around and where the closet station were. We had such a great time going from neighborhood to neighborhood. It was so easy to use the system, I even raved about it on Facebook because I liked it that much. It was also just fun to be on a bike again. There were plenty of biked and docks at each station, it seemed to seamless. I could give it 5 stars hand down.On day two we went out to the closet Citibike station and no bikes were there even though the app said that there were 18 bikes available. So i checked the app and it said there were 6 at the next station but when we walked there - No bikes. This happened at the next 5 stations. It was so frustrating to find station after station empty. When we finally found one with bikes, it was out of order, this happened with the next three stations. Twice I tried to call customer service to get a sense of what station we could find bikes and twice I waited for 20+ minutes before hanging up. We ended up just taking the metro which was disappointing because we had paid for a 24 hour pass and only had the chance to use it for 6 hours. Eventually we found some bikes in Times Square and rode the back to our hotel. Today I would give it 1 star. So there it is 5 stars for one experience, 1 star for the other. Now granted my first one was in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday and the next one was in the morning on a weekday - so I only thought it fair to average the ratings."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/14/2015,"I've been a member for a year and a half and up until yesterday I've had few problems.Yes, it's true that sometimes it can be hard to find a free docking station and individual docks sometimes don't work. Yesterday, however, I took a bike at 14th street and fifteen minutes later docked it at 29th street.The next day I got an email from Citi bike saying that I hadn't returned the bike and they were charging my card  for all the hours until  the bike is returned. I emailed back explaining what I had done. It took another day for them to get back to me, saying that the bike had turned up and my card had not been charged. Nevertheless I spent an uncomfortable day thinking that I would be charged $1500 for a stolen bike. It turned out OK in the end. But because you don't get a receipt when the bike is returned I had no way to prove that what I said was true. This has soured me a bit on what has been a great and inexpensive way to get around town."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/09/2013,"After a month of using the citibike, I have become obsessed.I check the the site and the internet for news of their progress installing new stations nightly.Of course, citibike is being tight lipped.  So excited for further penetration into Williamsburg.I have the yearly pass, which makes checking the bikes out super quick. I remember with frustration the long process getting a code to check out a bike before my yearly pass card came.  The bikes are heavy and the tires are often low.  You have to learn the quirks of your neighborhood.  I have been leaving for work earlier since you can't get a bike after 9 AM in the Williamsburg side of the Williamsburg bridge.But after two weeks of commuting to Wall Street on a citibike, I can see the changes in my figure.  it beats the subway.  It's faster for me to bike to work than take the subway.  it's cheaper, and I get a workout.  I'm debating purchasing a better lighter bike.  But I love the dock it and forget about it convenience of citibike.The other night I had a really great experience with citibike. I was able to get from 16th and Union Square West to Washington Square Park South in 5 minutes.  Try that walking or in a cab.  For short trips with less popular stations, you've hit the jackpot.I may end up getting a bike, but use citibike as well.  For my morning commute, a faster, lighter bike would be nice.  but then maybe it wouldn't be such a great workout.    And if I get a good bike, I'll have to worry about theft or vandalism.Really, I hope that citibike takes some of the 10 million in subscription fees to add more stations and hire more bike maintainers.  It's been frustrating the lack of communication.  They say they're going to double the number of stations.  But they don't say when.  Can't you just give us a hint of the timeline?I'm a fan, but hoping for better management."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/05/2013,I as charged $8 for being 7 seconds and 14 seconds over...Customer service WHAT THE FUCK!!!I have used bike system in Paris and in Montreal that where much easier and cheaper.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/18/2013,"I enjoyed my week on a citibike, it came in handy at times. The locations were plentiful, and the bike was a lot of fun. I'm sold. The advantages outweigh the drawbacks, and I'm glad these bikes are keeping this city out of the red."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/26/2016,"What a rif off.  First off,   the bikes are awful and there is no where to park them.  so if you plan on saving time by using one of these to commute, think again.  you won't be able to find a place to dock them once you take them out.  On top of that if you go over 30 minutes, be prepared to get ripped off.  We rented two bikes for 24 hours.  We went over the 30 minutes by 11 minutes and we were charged $43.  Stay away from this crooked bike share program.  this is what happens when you mix a bank with biking.   Rent a bike from a local bike rental shop."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/21/2015,"waste of money. Overcharge fees can exceed the daily rate, you can't bike anywhere north of 57th, and you have to constantly return the bike, wait 2 minutes, and then take out the same bike if you wanna bike any significant distance. Go to Talent Cycles or any other reasonable bike rental for a 24 rental that includes a helmet and lock and enjoy your freedom."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/16/2015,"As what others complaining about the overcharged fees and deposit, but I felt grateful that I spoke with a customer representative  which  polite and professional and he helps me to submit the refund! Thank you!"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/26/2013,"Disappointed in the overall operations but still love the concept and suspect it will continue to catch on.Considering Citi Bike services are provided by the same company (Alta Bicycle Share) that has been providing these services for large cities globally for many years, I'm constantly surprised that the operations aren't as smooth as they should be. This is not a new concept. I've used them in Montreal, Paris, and Melbourne and always had great experiences. So I was thrilled when I heard they were coming to NYC. Considering Alta's vast experience and all of the cities previously launched, one would think the kinks in service would have been worked out but (1) the app is definitely never reliable, (2) there are often broken bikes that can't be retrieved, and (3) it's very common to find a station completely FULL when you need to return a bike and completely EMPTY when you need to pick one up.The one time I did have to call customer service (which granted was the same day they launched) they were a bit clueless with how to even help me. After checking that my key was active, they basically just told me to go try a different station, which I did, and I was able to retrieve a bike. Good thing the stations are plentiful and not too far from one another."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/13/2013,"Pros: its cheap, its fun, healthy, its a great thing the city has sponsored, cons:* DEEP BREATH*  - they held 100$ DEPOSIT FOR 8 DAYS!! customer service is confused, you have to dock your bike EVERY 30 mins, so if you dont know the city, this is not for you, sometimes the docks dont work!! by the time you call customer service 30 mins are up, you are more worried to dock your bike than to enjoy the experience of riding through the city. its only for mid to downtown, SO if you live uptown manhattan there is no bikes (not surprised) .... if your bike gets stolen or whatver they can charge you $1000 FOR A RAGGEDY bike. OVERALL i like it but would not recommend it for a tourist, this is more ideal for a person who knows the city, has little trips to make, perhaps lives and works in the mid to downtown area then this would be ideal.  Its very cheap, and healthy so i enjoyed it but its more to run errands than anything."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/04/2013,"I love citibioke. I like the concept. I feel its a great parallel transportation system which has the potential to become as useful as the subway. I love the part where its a flat 100$ fee. .The one way rental is also an amazing concept. The only problem is that some racks are full, and they may want to reconsider their disribution of bikes, but thats a small problem, not worth taking a star away."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/08/2015,"I really thought this would be a fun experience, I'll just save you some time DON'T :("
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/09/2013,It's been a couple of weeks now riding the Citibike and with it's growing popularity i've seen instances of full docks or no bikes when i need one especially during rush hour. In residential areas i'm seeing not enough bikes in the morning and in corporate areas full docks. Also some maintenance issues with the bikes as well. As with any new service they have to work out the kinks and hopefully the demand will be met. Still a fan though but due to it's growing pains i'll have to drop it down a star.
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/04/2013,"I am giving my review as a joy rider. My husband and I were looking for something cheap to do this weekend and decided to rent bikes. I read the reviews first, so I'm just going to cut to the chase and put info that I wish I knew:1. My biggest concern: You can put your bag in the holder and it is completely snug. I recommend ladies totes and small messengers for the best fit. You need to make sure it is at least a big hand width and a big hand wide or it too small. Likewise if your height of bag is larger than a men's 10 shoe size, you need to squish like crazy. 2. We just needed a 24 hour rental pass to get the bikes out. We went to a station that had many bikes there and it took us 3 new codes and about 20 minutes because we couldn't get ANY of the bikes out!! Called customer service which was about a 15 minute wait. It is really obviously they are tweaking the bugs out. On the other hand, people with an annual drove by, picked the bikes up, and zoomed out of there.3. These bikes are HEAVY. THEY SUCK AT HILLS. Also they seem really dangerous for street riding. Have you ever noticed that hardcore bikers in the city have really thin, lightweight bikes? This is for a reason. These bikes are the exact opposite. 4. We docked our bike and were able to take the same ones out 1 minute later we just previously docked. Yay? If you are debating on trading in your bike for these set of wheels: don't. Having 30-45 minutes to put your bike back and retake your bike is annoying. For pleasure rides, try it. It's a cool experiment. For a lifestyle, there's a lot to work out."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/25/2013,"I am a Citibike fan, for sure. Been using the service now for two weeks and as a way to commute it rocks. They still have a few things to get right. The App is not accurate as far as telling you what bikes are available on which docks. Also I witnessed employees taking bikes away from Mid-town in the morning which is very logical and works. However I think that they should be faster at this service I arrived in Mid-town this morning at 8 AM and the dock was already full. The concept is great and I am sure will take off, they do need to get some of the details right they will lose don't forget this is New York and we demand the best.Updated thoughts. It is great. The app is better and the traffic is getting more used to bikes. They are said to be rolling out a lot more bikes which will be good. Still have the issue of Mid town scarcity at 6 PM. Very much enjoying the service."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/30/2016,"This company is a prime example of a victim of its own success. Amazing idea but horrible execution. Had an awful experience when my girl friends and I rented bikes for the day--would never recommend. First of all, the 30-min bike exchange rule is written in tiny print and extremely easy to miss. Not only that, but the rule is very inconvenient and makes it difficult to have an enjoyable ride. Moreover, biking to any place that does not have many citi bike stops is impossible without being charged a fortune extra for surpassing the allotted 30 minutes. More than that, Citi bike technology is very buggy. It happened twice that when we went to get a bike, the kiosk said that there were no bikes left when there were many checked in. Also, it happened twice that we tried to put bikes back in, and the machine would not register that the bike had been replaced, hence not allowing us to take out another bike and putting us at risk for overcharging based on the 30 minute rule. The telephone service desk was rude and not very helpful, and did not offer great solutions to our problems. They also put us on hold for long periods of time (most likely due to the fact that many people were calling complaining about similar glitches...). Again, I think the idea of Citi bike is amazing, but this company has done an exceptionally poor job implementing and running their bikes all over the world, but especially in NYC. Such a disappointment and an overall downer on an otherwise good day."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/28/2016,Citibike is a total scam. They will charge your credit card for things you shouldn't be responsible for like having to ride around in circles for half an hour looking for an empty dock because the app doesn't work properly then they refuse to refund the overcharge. You won't get anywhere calling or opening a bank dispute. I will not be renewing because of this. It's a shame because it's very handy. I miss the days when the customer was always right. Now it's the customer is always wrong...
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/26/2015,"Woohoo !  More stations have opened. I can not say enough positives about Citi Bike.  I LOVE IT !  If you live in the city and you are physically able to ride you owe it to yourself to join. Just be careful riding (more protected lanes DeBlassio ! It's the only issue I'll be voting on come next election).  And please ignore all the reviews (which you will see are mostly from visitors) that can't figure out its a means of transportation not a bike rental store for tourists.  Hence, you must return the bike to a station in less than 30 minutes (45 minutes for annual members).  Which is plenty of time. And if you are going a long distance just dock your bike and wait 30 seconds for it to register and take out another bike.  Rinse and repeat."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/08/2015,"Once again not a city bike to be found in the East Village and its only 2:30 in the afternoon. This happens every day. no bike for you need a bike, no spaces when you have a bike to park"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,02/06/2015,"Pros:- Solid bike - I've never had a problem with the bike itself.- Security - I had my personal bike stolen in NYC and I'm sure a replacement would get stolen too. For the price of an annual membership, you could buy 1/2 of a bad bike and it would be stolen in 1 year. - Safety - these things don't go too fast and have bright lights. I think they publish stats that say nobody has ever died on a Citi Bike, probably due to the low speeds, lights, maybe bike lanes too.- Geography - these are great if you live below 60th St. in Manhattan or around BK Heights to West Williamsburg. Not great if you live elsewhere. See Cons.- Price - for the $100-$150 you couldn't buy a bike (and if you did it would be unsafe and probably quickly stolen.). For the price you could hardly even get annual maintenance to a bike.- Support - they pick up the phone when you call and solve your issue. There have been times that the station has not registered that I've returned the bike, but phone support locates the bike and fixes the problem without making you feel like you stole the bike.- Data - they open source the data so anyone can use it for 3rd party apps, analysis, etc...Cons:- Geography - you can't get far on these bikes because the station footprint is limited. Also, they charge you if you keep a bike for more than 45 minutes.- Danger! - the streets of NYC are a dangerous place! The police give you tickets! Deliverymen ride the wrong way in bike lanes! Everyone parks in bike lanes! Stay safe!- Don't ride too long - you won't find a station to return the bike and you'll get charged- Learning the System/Available parking - if you try and return it to a more residential area late at night, it's tough to find parking. Riding around looking for parking sucks."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/05/2013,"I was so excited to see upon returning to work in NYC that the CitiBike service was available.  I quickly signed up for a yearly pass so I could avoid the least favorite part of my long commute - the subway.  Seeing that I had three stations near me, I thought I should be in good shape for getting a bike anytime that I needed one.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case and seeing that I work at a college and it is summer, it will only get worse when the students return. In addition to getting a bike, returning bikes at Penn Station has been a nightmare.  At 5PM rush time, everyone is returning bikes to Penn Station.  I have missed my train several times due to having to hunt or wait for an open station to dock my bike.  When I wrote Citibike, they didn't seem to care one way or the other.I have also had trouble docking bikes.  Getting the bike locked into place is more difficult than it should be.  In the time I have had my account, it is rare that I do not have some sort of problem with a station.  I really wanted this to work out but it looks like I will be buying a folding bike so I can have reliable transportation back and forth to work.  Citibike is a great idea but the execution is poor - hence the 2 star rating.  I would not recommend using Citibike for transportation you have to count on.  For the occasional bike ride it is a good deal."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/10/2013,"Citi Bike's are a great way to see the sights or simply to get around.We rode the Citi Bikes from Chelsea to Tribeca and it was way better than walking or taking a subway. Watch where you're going and pay attention, and you'll have no problems with the Citi Bike."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/15/2013,"I was a fan from using it on a trip to Montreal, and got my annual membership key before it started.It is really helpful avoiding multi-transfer trips on the subway, and to reach places with few subway lines.  And given the limited numbers of Select Bus Service lines (what's up with that?), it is a great option.Love the station density, and hope they don't make DC's mistake of scattering stations too far from each other as it expands.And the system seems to be getting better at rebalancing and maintenance since the first few weeks.  My complaint is more about the quality of NYC's bike lanes, and the timing of traffic lights.  It seems on the protected bike lanes (called ""Green Lanes"" in some places), the lights don't allow for a rider to travel more than a few blocks before having to stop for a red light.  To encourage faster trips, time the lights so bikes can ride a lot of blocks.  It is A LOT easier for a driver to brake than for a cyclist to stop.  This is called the ""Green Wave"" in other cities."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/01/2014,"No need to add to the dozens of comments about non-functioning stations and not enough bikes and/or docks, but I will say this: Either the city needs to invest in the program, or Citibank needs to realize its reputation is going to suffer by having its name on a program that has so many flaws. Not everything can be entirely run by the private sector, especially something like this which is quickly becoming a major form of transportation meant to supplement subways, buses and taxis."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/15/2016,Very disappointed lately by Citibike. I bought a year pass and live in Brooklyn Heights. Lately the Clark St and Columbia Heights stations are empty almost every time I need to use them. The bikes are often in very bad shape. They really need to refill stations and do something now. The docks many times do not work. The new bikes are very nice if you can find them. But honestly it's become a service I pay for that no longer works in my neighborhood. I am going to request a refund.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/05/2014,"UPDATE:  Sad to have to edit my review a day later... but Citibike (a brilliant concept) needs to get knocked down to 1-star for now based on pure mismanagement.  Last night Citibike, obviously with the best of intentions, sent trucks around to replenish the racks.  The theme here is ""Too much of a good thing can turn south fast""!  & ""Learn to plan like a pro""Somehow, the idea of demand, traffic and logistical planning eluded all Citibike upper management.  I started at Stuytown for a quick jaunt to 2nd and Ave B to watch the MIA-SA NBA Finals with a friend.  Every rack was either overfilled, or the remaining spaces were broken.  Dozens of people were circling the East Village, Alphabet City, Lower East Side and Chinatown with no place to re-rack.  Are you kidding?  Calling in to Customer Service was useless.  A guy who identified himself as Gordon kept sending me to various locations that their software told them had multiple open spaces.  For some reason their field techs who TAPED OFF stalls for repair never relayed the information.  Way to work in a silo!  All their database info was inaccurate.  I RODE TO 9 STATIONS ONLY TO HAVE CUSTOMER SERVICE SUGGEST LOCATIONS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN WITH NO REMEDY THAN TO OFFER EXTRA TIME!!!!!  Want proof?  I shot video of multiple locations last night and will YOUTUBE IT!  The title will be: ""WTF CITIBIKE????""  There are many guest appearances by fellow disgruntled bikers.  Featured locations: 14th & B, 2nd & B, Stanton & Suffolk, Houston & Allen, 9th & C... there's more... OMG need I go on?I missed half of an epic NBA Finals and ended up all over town.   Many people were stuck with time OVERAGE CHARGES.  Mind you I overpaid for your service to begin with by purchasing multiple passes (Annual & Weekly at the same time)!  That's how much I believe in you.  Your customer service makes me long for Time Warner Cable Tech Support!!!!!!!!!!!Anyone worth their salt in NYC knows bike traffic on a Thursday summer night heads downtown to the village.  Overstocking village racks meant all the Citibike traffic coming in had nowhere to ""park"".  You call this logistics?  (Duh, Villagers take bikes mostly central or uptown for work, downtown after hours - this is NY!) Did you give any thought to making people ride all over the place like mad in the dark could cause injury?  One bad lawsuit due to this kind of poor planning and you will find out.My dear Citibike management, here are some analogies to help you realign your abysmal customer service:On the topic of overfilling racks: ""If a bar offers you a free pint of beer = good thing, right?  If they offer you 3 gallons of beer and say you have to drink it all yourself in the next 45 minutes or there will be trouble = bad, si?""On the topic of the user agreement: ""If your bank says you have to make a payment at one of their locations but they close their local branches, can they claim you refused to make a payment?  don't they owe you points of access?""Please Citibike, fix this situation and help me edit this back to 4-stars.  Your concept is brilliant.  Your constant business execution issues are ridiculous!  My original review:While I've penned massive reviews about Citibike in articles, I will spare the lengthy discussion and highlight 2 points:1) Reliability:  Citibike is great if you have the ""Annual Pass"".  Annual Members receive a digital key that reliably unlocks bikes.  24-Hour and Weekly Pass users must go to a kiosk and insert their credit card (that was used at time of purchase) to generate a 5-digit unlock code.  These codes are unreliable and quite frustrating.2) Date Nights/Uber Replacement/Get Creative: Use Citibike in place of a cab ride and tally up your savings.  You'll be amazed.  Use it for a ""date night"" and get out on the town.  Can you ride in a stretch mini-skirt?  Yes.  Had a writer put it to the test, pics and all and it worked!  Take a ride up to the park, grab a tan, then shoot to St Mark's for a wander in the East Village.  Of course, whatever you do please ride responsibly and... don't drink and ride!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/19/2014,"The bike concept is a great idea can't wait till we mature as a civilization to where this service is free. The problem I have with these bikes is the $100 dollar deposit that Citibank holds for 10 days that's madness it's crazy and and they don't even pay you interest on your money, that right there pissed me off I rented 3 bikes $300 locked up for 10 days crazy, but the kids and I did have a nice 30 minute $300 ride over the bridge priceless. Won't be renting those bikes again until they change the deposit policy."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/03/2015,"Be warned, if you get stuck with overtime fees, customer service will tell you all kinds of reasons you can't get your money back even if its their fault.  You have to dock the bike every half hour despite the ""24 hour"" daily pass, which is poorly explained on the kiosk.  The signs are confusing and some of the stations don't even work.  When i called up citibike about my experience they said they would issue a refund for the additional $67 they charged me for not docking in time as i was first time user.  i was thrilled until they sent me a $40 refund.  Didnt even have the courtesy to let me know it was going to be a partial refund.  I would have liked to use again, but now i just have a bad taste in my mouth and a deposit of $200 thats still sitting on my card 5 days later."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/19/2014,"Ridiculously awful.  Here was my experience in order as best as I can remember it.  Please keep in mind that I've used Capital Bike Share in DC which is a similar service with ZERO problems.1.  Attempt to rent a bike at first station.  Machine tells me that the ""transaction failed, please try again later"" twice.  I decide to walk to another citi bike station 3-4 blocks away.2.  Successfully rent bike, but about one minute into riding it it starts screeching.  Terribly.  Little children are holding their ears around me, but I need to get to the next station.3.  Arrive at next station, all slots are full, despite the app saying it had 7 free spots.  Attempt to press ""Request time credit"", but the touch screen is broken.  I'm now out another $4.  Walk to next station about 2-3 blocks away.4.  Successfully get a bike at next stop and ride it uneventfully to my next stop.  This was the only leg of my trip that worked well.5.  Check in bike.  Attempt to check out one of the bikes.  The touch screen works, but using the code won't release the (last) bike on the rack.  I decide to just keep biking to the next stop since I had another 5 minutes or so remaining.6.  Ride to next station and check in bike.  Attempt to checkout, but the touch screen is broken.  7. Walk 4 blocks to next station that shows 5 available bikes.  Zero are there.  Walk 3 blocks to next station.8.  Check out a new bike.  Ride about one block and realize the rear brake when used makes a noise so loud that it sounds like the rear tire is going to rip off.  People around me are staring and wondering what the hell is going on.  I return the bike and swap it for a second one, which fortunately works and I head to my last stop.Here's the count for you:Fully functioning stations:  2/8Broken bikes:  2Most stressful cycling day of my life."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,06/15/2013,"Received my key June 14th. Rode four trips just in my first day!Quite a few of the docking stations aren't working, and the lights seem to go red, yellow, or green at random. Slightly nerve-wracking not to be certain that it has acknowledged that the bike has been returned, but other than that it worked well in Tribeca, West Village, and Chelsea neighborhoods."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/18/2014,"I was beyond thrilled to see these bikes available when I visited New York City. We promptly began the process of renting them and envisioned a day free of subways and taxis. From the word go we started to have problems. We rented two bikes with one credit card and every single time it gave us two codes one of the codes would not work, and we would have to wait 2 to 3 minutes for that code to expire and request another code from the machine, but meanwhile the other bike had been free for five minutes and so now we only had 25 minutes to get to the next Dock station. It was very frustrating. Mind you, we had to go through this process six times, because we had to get new bikes six times in order to get around Manhattan throughout the day. Why? Because of this ridiculously short time limit of 30 minutes. At one point, we were trying to race between cars and constantly check our phone's map to find the next docking station, panicking that we would be late, and we got stuck at a red light. I crossed illegally because I didn't want to be charged extra, and I still was two minutes late and we both got charged four dollars. Completely unreasonable. There is no way that you should only have 30 minutes to navigate the city with traffic and find a new docking station. To get from the World Trade Center to Central Park we almost had to rent a bike three separate times! We ended up walking the rest of the way. But let's get to the best part... When we went to dock the bike, if there were free places to dock it, half of the docking stations did not work. They simply would not lock the bike in and you had to keep looking for a new one. And, if you want to be on your way quickly with a new bike, you can forget about that. You have to wait 2 to 5 minutes to even go through the process to get another ticket to get another code to get another bike, when you just had to return a bike that you weren't finished using because of the time limit. Brilliant.The bikes are bulky and awkward to ride, and it is very hard to figure out where the next docking station is if you are not familiar with the area. Half the bikes are out of service. Or they just won't unlock for some unknown reason and you have to move on to the next one. By the end of the night, we were so sick of these bikes. We spent most of our time in Manhattan obsessing over where to return a bike or how we would plan our day so that we could get it back in time. We wish we would've just taken the subway. I haven't even dealt with customer service, so I can't comment on that. But I am calling to try and get our eight dollars back, and we are apprehensive about the $101 hold they put on the card for each bike. I've been told that sometimes it stays on there for weeks. Hopefully there is no trouble with that. What a great idea that is crippled with poor execution."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/02/2013,Love it!  I use it to get around from Mid-town east to my office at Penn Station and to Hell's Kitchen.  This is so much faster than walking or taking the subway for short trips (especially cross town).  Plus it saves a ton of money.  First you have to get a yearly pass.  That's it.  Don't mess with the kiosk.I have had nothing but great success with the Citibike.  Every once and a while I may have to walk a few extra blocks to find a bike but that's going to happen during rush hours.  If a station is dead there is usually a working one close.  I don't understand all the negative complaints as I have had no really bad experience and I have ridden it every day for the last month.  with about 40 trips under my belt.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/11/2014,"First off: If you have had any issues with Citibike, please file a complaint with BBB, or call 311.bbb.orgThey are one of the most dishonest service I have used.  I signed up for as an annual member for one year, what a mistake :)If you are a tourist, rent a bike at a bike shop instead.  It's cheaper, more reliable, and you won't go back home finding out they put extra charges on your card.Disadvantages:1) They are dishonest and will charge you wrongfully if the system doesn't recognize you returned the bike. They will not refund your money.2) At times it can be hard to find an available bike/station to return bikes within walking distance.3) Risky to use the service if you are in a hurry.4) you can't trust the App when it tell you there are stations to rerun the bike or bike available for pickup5) Bike are starting to get rundown and at times the only free bike you find has an issue, which is why it's still there.6) It's too expensive for what you get.Advantages:1) If it didn't have to above issues, it would be a fantastic way to get around town weather permitting.Issues I have had:1) No bike at stations within walking distance.2) No station to return bikes within walking distance.3) Faulty App almost always tells you there are bike available when they are none.  Or there are a few but have a red light indicating they can't be taken out.4) Faulty App often tells you there are stations to return bike, but either there aren't any or they are not working.Note: I even check app after a few minutes of standing there and called there customer service and their system also showed bike/stations available.  But there weren't any.5) On many occasions I would return a bike and when I went to take a new bike out, the light would turn red an it wouldn't release a bike.  I would have to call the customer service and at times it would give up after 20min of waiting.  But they always fixed the problem right away if you waited enough time.6) To my dismay they were charging my credit card every now and then. $2 here $9 there and the amounts being so small I didn't notice them at first.  But when I called them they refused to refund me.  Saying it was my responsibility to properly lock the bike and that it's on the policy I signed up when I took the bike.  But I always made sure I got a green light after returning the bike and if I didn't I would always call them and wait till they pickup the phone and released the bike.It's worth saying again.  If you have issues with them, please file a complaint with BBB, or call 311.  bbb.comWe can't let bad businesses like this to thrive while much better, more honest business go out of service.  I love the fact that more people are biking around the city, but I hate to see them getting ripped off by dishonest people.  We deserver better than this and let's let the world know."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/15/2016,"Love it. Perfect Enjoyed my first Citibike experience. Picked up a bike for the unlimited 30-minute rides for one day at 106th CPW. Docked it at 102nd CPW to renew another 30 minutes when I spent time talking to friends instead of starting to ride. At 59th St end of the park, I walked the bike to Dock and unload again at 61st and Broadway, just 1 block from CPW at that end of the park. Headed back north for to finish the CPWbike path. Then docked the bike for the final time at 102nd. You need to wait 2 minutes before you can take / undock the bike by placing your credit card back in the machine for a new code. That was fine for me because I welcomed the break. I will probably take an annual membership instead of buying a bike because of ease of use and not having to worry about where I lock my own bike during stops such as showing apartments in my job as a real estate agent or stopping at a restaurant. All worked great! Love it. Perfect."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/20/2014,"I love the CitiBike concept, but after some horrible word-of-mouth and my own bad customer service experience today, I won't be using their service.I live in NYC and have been thinking about getting the annual membership for a while. I finally decided I'd take the plunge today, only to find out that if I buy the membership today, I won't be able to use it for over a week until a key comes in the mail. I called customer service asking if I could get a temporary code in the meantime, and I was told no, I could not. They offered me no workaround, and that was after waiting on hold for 10 minutes.To me, if a business can't even get the payment options right, there are probably going to be a lot of other problems down the road as well. It seems obvious that people want instant gratification--that when they buy something, they'll want to start using it right away. This is especially frustrating, as there is a very simple solution. Why not just offer new annual members a temporary code, much like the codes people who buy the 7-day pass use?CitiBike, get your act together."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/11/2014,"Never again. I called Citi Bike and they told me my deposit was released from 2 weeks ago....when I called to check on it for the second time, they told me to speak to my bank to release it. I called my bank and they said they have no record of Citi Bike holding the money so basically my $110 is floating in space until further notice"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/12/2015,"I purchased 4 week-long passes when visiting NYC.  I had no problems with it the first day, but on the second, the system claimed we didn't properly dock one of the bikes and rescinded use of one of our passes.  We had followed all instructions for docking but the customer service representatives could offer us no recourse until they ""recovered"" the bike which underhandedly shifts liability to the customer.When I finally spoke to a supervisor, she promised a full refund which I did not receive.  When I contacted customer service four days later, I received no response.  It has been seven days since I last contacted Citi Bike's customer service and still no response.I have used bike rental systems in multiple cities and they all have similar flaws but I have never encountered such uninterested customer service."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/19/2014,"The concept of Citibike is better than what you actually get. The bikes are crappy and the computer system doesn't always work. One time, I went to FOUR different docking stations only to find out that every one was broken. I spent more time on the phone with customer service than on a bike.Unless you're a tourist, just buy a bike."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/31/2016,"i have no idea how this awful system stays in operation - the bikes are either completely gone or the stations where you go to return them are full - which means you have to drive around and around and around to other stations hoping to find a place to dock it - or get charged a hefty fee.i don't understand why they don't have trucks relocating the bikes around town - oh, they say they do, but the only place I ever see them at is near penn station - and why?  Penn Station has numerous transportaton options.   The east village is the worst!!  Bikes are gone by 8:45 am and empty all day until 6 pm - and then the rack are 100%full with the returning white kids from their fancy jobs.  What this means is noone can use a bike during the day or at night - since if you take a bike out, chances are when you return there will be no open docks.  Why isn't this problem fixed?"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/20/2016,"Rip off!!!!! OK, I admit that I didn't read the fine print, but charging people an overtime charge for not docking your bike every 30 minutes is just wrong.

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/02/2016,"Scammers.... Honestly rented a citibike for like 20 minutes, returned it and they charged me about 100 dollars.  Customer service was service was non-existant and the people wouldn't transfer me to someone in charge.  All they would day is that someone would cal in 3 business days.  It's been a week and still no call.  Writing it off as experience to never use CitiBike again."

NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/01/2013,"Having used similar systems in other cities, we found the largest disadvantage was the 30-minute limit! We were staying in tribeca and wanted to ride across the Brooklyn bridge - which would have had us stopping twice. However, due to the fact there are stoplights, excessive pedestrian traffic, etc, there's no way we would have made our 2nd 30-minute stop....and we didn't.Also, the fact you need a new code each time you check in, even if you purchased a 24-hour pass, is definitely an inconvenience. We were next to a few European travelers, and they were incredibly confused:( GREAT CONCEPT - so glad it's in the city and is available, just has a few kinks to work out!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/31/2016,A great way to stay fit. Some of the bikes are less than great but when you think of the wear and tear it's expected. And the cost is fantastic if you do an annual. Learning and sharing secrets with other Citi bikers is helpful: the bikes with plastic wheel covers and Mets stickers are newer and lighter. Some of the old bikes are like riding tanks. Super heavy.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/20/2014,"I am generally very patient but I am FURIOUS with my citi bike experience.

Now I am emailing them they are not even replying, what kind of service is that?!Complete disappointment !"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/12/2016,"The concept is great, but it is a terrible design and a complete rip off!!  In order not to be charged constantly for your time, you have to check in at a bike station every 30 minutes!  You spend your entire time looking for the next bike station rather than enjoying your ride and the sites.  We missed most of the sites in Central Park because we had to find the next bike station to check in so we would not be charged for every additional 15 minutes!!  And when the check in place is full, as the one we rode to near Central Park, you have to find another check in point!!  Plus you can never let your bike out of your site because thee are no locks with them.  There are lots of places to rent bikes for the day and they come with bike locks so DO NOT CHOOSE CITI BIKE!!"

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/03/2015,"Bike sharing in a city--what a great idea. In reality, what a kafkaesque nightmare. I'd heard that the new CEO, Jay Walder, had resolved many of the issues I'd heard people complain about, and was going to improve the service. What a failure. I used the service twice. As it stands right now I've paid $350 for two 40 minute bike rides. Wow, not even Uber peak pricing is that awful.I returned my last bike to a dock on a friday. Monday morning I received an email stating my account had been charged $1200 for a lost/stolen bike (accept the actual amount was over $1300). I call the rep who informs me that since I didn't notify them the bike was lost/stolen they made the charge. They claim they tried to call me (but no email).  OK well let's reverse it because the bike was returned I request. They claim they didn't have it in the system. Then I talk to the supervisor. I ask how to resolve this since it's the first I'm hearing of it. She explains I needed to call within 24 hours of loosing the bike. Well, I put the bike back into a dock, why would I call when the bike wasn't lost or stolen. She informs me there's nothing she can do. I ask if I should call the police and make a report to see who stole the bike and see if security tapes can be obtained.  She asks me what the error code was that I saw when I returned the bike 3 days ago. Um, I didn't realize I needed to look. Well, she can see that there was an error when I tried to return it. Great I think, so the bike is in the system. No she says there was an error, therefor the bike wasn't returned and the she informs me I may do whatever I like and hangs up. I call back, this time I get another person, somewhat more helpful. She looks into again and can't find the bike in the system but she can see that the dock was not used again. Maybe the bike the bike is still there. Can I go check and call them back. Yes, I can.I go to the bike rack and lo and behold the bike is there exactly where it was 3 days ago. Still locked in the dock. I call the rep. She asks me to push the bike in hard. I do. She says did you just put it in. No the bike has been here since the first 'error reading' on friday, less than an hour after I took it out. She says well, sometimes when you return the bikes if you push them in too hard it causes the error. But that's exactly what she asked me to do. Anyway, she says the bike is in the system, sorry for the inconvenience you will not be charged.I get home, and there's an email saying it will be 3-5 days before they release the $1300 but in the meantime they are charging $171 in additional late fees. WTF.I email. I call back. Finally, later in the evening I get a truly polite and professional individual. They take the time to look into the matter and again, check with a supervisor. And again, I'm told they will reverse all the charges. Great. I go to bed thinking the matter resolved. Today, I get another email stating they will be charging late fees and there's nothing they can do. I need to speak with another supervisor. So nearly $1500 of fees they may or may not return in the next 3-5 business days for a bike that was returned in less than an hour. The was the most expensive bike rental ever. Never again. I've learned my lesson. Tell your friends, tell your family but don't tell your enemies. Tell them to use citibike...it's the best revenge."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/02/2016,Citibike has a rule that even if you rent the bike for a day you have to dock the bike every 30 minutes! This turns out to be very difficult especially for tourists who usually aren't even aware of the rule. They are back in their own country before they see a huge extra fee for not searching for a docking station every 30 minutes. It happened to my friends. Why such inflexibility? I guess citibike make a lot of money that way. Welcome to New York!
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/16/2014,Never ever ride more than 30 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ridiculous High Payment for Overtime cost me 77 dollars.  if you exceed 50 seconds after 90 overtime you will pay 12 dollars for that just 50 seconds.

When I called customer service they say according to their system the bike was used for over a day. The bike was properly docked! but I suppose their systems don't work. What a shitty service!

NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,12/15/2014,"Spent weekend in NYC and loved the idea of exploring on the bikes. Girlfriend and I bought 2 day passes. The weather was cold so I think the idea of renting bikes wasn't overly popular so there was never an issue with available bikes. Bikes seemed to be generally in good working order. The problem came with the aspect of getting codes and unlocking the bikes. We routinely could not get one or both codes to work which then required waiting 2 minutes and then retrying. We also encountered a broken kiosk screen after locking up bikes which prevented unlocking a new set of bikes, requiring us to walk to the nearest station. After couple hours we were totally aggravated by the system failures and Citi Bike refunded our money. We have rented bikes in DC and always had great experiences with Capital Bikeshare. Hopefully the Citi Bike system problems can be worked out and the system will improve. The customer service dept was always prompt to answer and courteous but they didn't have the ability to issue codes over the phone when kiosk generated codes failed or kiosks were broken so their support is limited. Bottom line, it's a fun way to tour NY and the price is right but the system isn't reliable at this time."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,10/17/2014,"UPDATE: After purchasing the annual membership, my experience improved greatly (for daily and weekly, look at my original review below). I have it a three because some weeks it's a 5 - no issues, jump on and go, life is good. Other weeks it's the same old story, no bikes a) are there, b) unlock, or c) are in working condition. Overall, it needs some serious investment, but when it works (45-65% of the time), it's great. ___________________________________From my short 4-day research, it seems specially designed only to work for true NYers (meaning those with an annual membership). So I signed up for annual membership, but while waiting for my key to arrive (any day now?) I did the weekly pass. Then my daily nightmare began. In my journey from Grand Central to 10th Ave (which should take 10-15 minute ride) it inevitably takes more like 25: 10-15 min of actual riding after 10 minutes of attempting to unlock the bike on either side by putting the code in, seeing red, trying it 3 more bikes, getting a new code after waiting the requisite 2 minutes, trying the next code and repeat until it eventually works. Or I give up and walk to the next station - eating up more time. Why is this better than a taxi again? I guess it depends on how much your time is worth. It's not that I don't like the concept or want the program to succeed - I absolutely rely on it to get to an area the subway doesn't go, but in the first week I've had some issue every day. Sometimes both ways, but mostly GCT. It seems like those with an annual membership don't have any problems, so I'm hoping when the key arrives I can come back and add a few stars (unfailing optimism or delusion?) Until then - I hate it. It's one of the outer levels of hell. With a blue bike."

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/22/2014,"Watch Your Wallet - These Guys are Sharks!Make sure to check your credit card statement DAILY. Day one went pretty well with only a few stations that had problems offering up bikes against provided codes. But day two in lower Manhattan (Wall Str) was an ABSOLUTE DISASTER!First - it took 3-4 codes at each station to get a bike - which cut into riding time as there were three of us. Then we ended up at two stations that would not give up bikes regardless of the number of codes generated.Customer service advised us at the first station that would not provide a working code, that it was probably low batteries at that station and to walk to the next closest station (which was a pretty good distance away and in the wrong direction). After getting there - that station would also not give up a working code. Customer service was customer NO service and was not helpful.Woke up this morning to find my debit card charged for $303.00 rather than the $9.95 contracted. Obviously due to the stations not registering the bikes.Now I am in a dispute with them and my bank that will take WEEKS to repair.While I applaud the city of New York to be so forward thinking and evironmentally conscious by deploying this bike system, the company mis-managing this i program is an absolute disaster. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE AT RISK OF GETTING STRANDED without a bike. And then charges on your card resulting due to a break down in their system"

NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/24/2013,"I LOVE Citibike! I had soooo much fun Citibiking all over the city for 2 days this weekend. We rode for about 6 hours the first day and then about 4 hours the next. We took our Citibikes from the East Village over to the West Village, then over to the West Side Highway. We rode all the way up to about 46th Street and then took them back down to Battery Park. The bike lane on the west side is really so nice and it was so much fun because you can go fast without worrying about any cars or having to stop.  I have to say, I was super hesitant about this whole concept at first and was definitely nervous to take the bike out onto busy avenues with lots of cars and no bike lane. But after a days worth of riding, you get used to it and become more daring, the same way you would walk as a pedestrian. The bikes themselves are great.  If you put a bag in the front, it makes your bike feel top heavy and weird, so I would advise riding with as little things as possible. We figured out a way to strap in our bottles of water in the front. The bike has these two elastic bands that you can strap in your stuff to the front. Oh and if you feel like your bike may be broken, (which happened to me with the first one I took out), all you have to do is lock the bike back in and wait 2 minutes to get another code in order to take out another bike. You also should press the repair button on the dock where you locked in the broken bike. One thing that really was annoying and kind of unacceptable considering this is brand new and it's Citibank - is that the touch screens and machines at many of the stations are not working properly. Several times my code wouldn't work and I would have to wait another 2 minutes in order to request a new code. Several times the machines were broken, where it didn't allow you to request a new code with your credit card. I had a 24 hour pass, so I unfortunately had to keep inserting my credit card into the machines in order to get a new code to unlock the bike. If you have an annual pass, all you do is use your key to unlock a bike at the actual dock where the bike is and you don't have to deal with the codes. Oh and sometimes the app will show you that a station has a certain amount of bikes available, but when you get there, all of them are broken. So you have to then find the next station and hope there are available bikes. I learned that if the app is showing there are any less than 5 bikes available, that your chances of finding a bike you actually can take out is low.  However, I do see the van going around the city re-distributing the bikes so hopefully they are working out these quirks. I loved it so much that I ordered the annual key and will be anxiously waiting for it in the mail!"

I do use the bikes regularly.The idea might be beautiful but their whole system is completely flawed to the point where it beats the original purpose: convenience. It seems citibike has really striven to become less convenient than the existing transit systems such as subways and buses.Why? As everyone who's tried the bike share for a few days knows:* You can be waiting over 2 weeks EASILY before receiving keys for an annual membership. You think you can stop paying the unlimited metro card but then end up spending way more to cover all the weeks these jerks take to mail freaking keys.* The machines are CRAP. The software is slow and glitchy as hell, like 4-graders made it. The card readers are specially prone to malfunctioning -making the system specially sucky for people with temporary passes. NO RELIABILITY. I'd say more than half the times I've tried to use one they either weren't there or didn't work at all - not even showing an error message. CRAP (Like every Citi bank system, BTW)* 0 RELIABILITY, something will go wrong 50% or more of the time. The system will be down, the machine will be off, the reader is bad, the bike is broken and you can't tell until you get it (and then need to wait 2 minutes to try again)... the list goes on and on. It's almost like the MTA's dream come true, a conspiracy to prove bike shares don't work. Bottom line YOU CAN'T RELY ON THIS CRAPPY SYSTEM because it sucks, like Citi bank (again, BTW)* Entire stations dissapear! WTF. There's no information, and the diagrams are comlpetely unreliable. Not even the website or app have accurate information. Stations are literally removed overnight with NO WANING.

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/09/2013,"Horrible customer service. My husband and I purchased 2 week-long bike passes. But because we bought them both on his credit card in the same transaction, it turns out that we can only use them when we're together and using his card to get an access code. Awesome. I called and spoke to a manager who simply refused to help solve the problem. In fact he told me he didn't care that we were having a problem with the system. Way to go Citibikes, we wanted to buy annual passes, but your customer service pissed us off so much that you just lost 2 annual subscriptions."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/08/2015,Citibikes  NYC do not describe very well how much they charge you when you are using their bikes.  The charged me $51.00 for 2 1/2 hours.  I guess they are there for locals to go from bus to where they need to go. little quick 29 minute trips.  Plus they hold onto your $100. deposit for several days.  Not cool and I will not use this service again.   feeling overcharged citibikebank.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/03/2013,"I really wanted to like this concept, but it remains a disaster. I have a long commute to the far the east side and cutting down the 15 min walk to the train each way sounded like a good idea. Gave the program a few weeks to work out the kinks and decided to try it out today. I was really ready to be patient and understanding but in one word - AWFUL. First, ridiculous pricing structure is ridiculous and seems designed not to encourage people to try it. $10.80 for the only option (24 hour pass) for what would be two rides back and forth to the office..seriously?! Why no one ride? Anyway, I realize the yearly is the only way to go and was willing to shell just out to give it a try. Second, the kiosk was horrendous to use. The screens barely respond to touch, you have to basically punch it with your finger to respond. Then it plays 20 questions with you. For crissakes this is new york, I'm in a hurry. Let me pay and be on my way. Finally I get my code. I had read how to get the bikes out so I was prepared. Unfortunately after trying 5 different bikes, none would release. I called and asked for my money back. The only positive experience was the customer service rep was nice. Sorry but never again. You've lost me, Citibike."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/26/2013,"The first month or so I would have given it 5 stars. However, the past 2 months getting trying to get a bike a round Penn Station is a useless task. Only once in the past 6 weeks have I been able to get a bike in the morning. 6 bike stations in the area and EVERY single one  is empty, EVERY morning. I'm not exaggerating. I've sent multiple emails, at first just saying 'hey, just letting you know...""  and now last one just telling them I'm bagging it."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,06/04/2013,"I'm a keen bike rider from Vancouver visiting New York--Manhattan, Lower East Side. I've been here many times and I ALWAYS get a bike as soon as I get to town. My last 3 visits I've zoomed all over the city, even in February, and I absolutely LOVE biking in New York, so I was super excited to see the Bixi bike idea here in NYC. It *is* a Canadian invention, after all. It's fine, for non-serious bike riders--like my mother or my wife. For someone who is a seasoned bike rider, though, it might fall short. I never went out of gear 3 the ""highest"" gear, i.e. the one for going the fastest--which is nearly the lowest gear on my ten speed at home. I suppose these bikes are good for grannies, but for a ""normal"" bike rider, it needs a few more gears. Bottom line: you cannot go fast on these bikes.My main criticism is that there is NO FEEDBACK about time. I checked the time when I released the bike (which takes a bit of a learning session to get it out, but OK once you learn it, it's a no-brainer). Then as I was riding I was constantly checking my smartphone to see what time it was. Then when I had about 10 minutes to spare I started to use the CitiBike iPhone app to find the nearest docking station. I found it, with minutes to spare, but was not precisely sure if I was over or if I made it under the 30 minute wire. How to tell? No idea. The bike gives no indication if you are going to be billed the $4 penalty, nor does the docking station. Do I have to wait until I get my VISA bill? That seems like an odd way to run a business. Can I go to some website to see what my charges are? There's no instructions or indication of overage charges.Nowadays, with digital technology so pervasive, how hard would it be to have a 30 minute count-down timer on the ""dashboard"" of the bike? There's plenty of room for it. This would ease ""riding anxiety"" for the renter--that's for sure. I wish the bikes had this, and there's no good reason why it's missing.To end on a positive note: the seat is amazingly comfortable. The bike is super easy to use and adjust for seat height. The gears are perfect for old people and novices. The handle grips are spongy and comfortable. The seating is upright and pleasant. The tires are huge and won't slip into the many NYC sewer grates and street cracks. Everything about this bike calls: ""Ride me! It's fun and easy and safe!"" So that is all good, and hopefully more people will ride bikes in New York.However, if you are an avid cyclist, just rent a bike at a proper bike shop, or book a hotel that has good bikes for free. Finally let me say it again: there is no better way to get around New York than on a bicycle. DO IT!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/28/2013,"Woe be to you if you think you can take the bike out for spin. I visited New York this past weekend and thought it would be fun to take a ride in Prospect Park.  I rented two bikes.  The first station wouldn't accept my card or my companion's.  There were two very frustrated riders desperately trying to unlock their bikes in the allotted five minute window, I don't know if they were able to get their bikes.  We walked over to the station on 4th and Dean and were able to get two bikes.  It was not clear to me that you needed to re-dock the bike within 30 minutes or incur a $13 dollar overtime fee.  Citi Bike says it's clear but, it isn't at all.  We had a lovely ride in the park, brought the bikes back and went on our way.  Imagine my surprise when three days later I was charged the outrageous fee and the deposit fee was still be held on my account.  What a racket is all I can say.  If you are from out of town, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this rip off.Well color me stupid.  I finally figured out the mechanics of citibike and totally misunderstood how it works. I take it al back."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/23/2013,"BEWARE prospective annual members of Cititbike.  The $95 annual membership fee (plus tax) is not truly a $95 fee IF you want to be able to use a bike immediately.  There is a 10 day wait period for a key to arrive in the mail.  So if you are planning to ride today, you will need to spend another $9.95 (plus tax), making the cost of your annual membership potentially as high as an additional $99.50 or if you opt for a week long pass at $25.95 then the additional cost is only $51.90 (plus tax of course).  So in essence, there is no such thing as a $95.00 annual membership. It is a 355 day membership or, if you wish to ride immediately, it is anywhere from a $114.95 (pus tax) membership to a $145.90 (plus tax) membership.  When I called Citibike incredulous that the $103 I had just ten minutes ago forked over on my credit card did not allow me immediate access to a bike, I was told ""that's what it says on the website,"" but nowhere on the annual membership sign up page does it say you will not have access to a bike for 10 days.  It says you will not receive a key for ten days, but nowhere does it state that you must pay additional monies in order to ride a bike before ten days.  If Citibike allows one day or week long riders to have immediate access to bikes, why not annual?? Would it have been that difficult to allow the annual member to buy a membership at the kiosk and ride off immediately or a code when registering online to allow access before the key arrives??  Or does Citbike hope that more annual members will opt to spend additional money than sit at home and fume like this one is?  I do not fume quietly.  Before writing this review, when I called Citibike I asked to speak with a manager. It became clear that I was not the first angry customer.  Great news! - Citibike is just starting and already does not care about its customers.Bottomline, it is poor business sense to infuriate what could be the core base of a business - unless, of course, Citibike's operating plan involves maximizing income over benefiting city residents.  Is it too much to hope that Citibike has better plan for how it will maintain the bikes?  If not, then New York residents may be in for a rude and rusty surprise.  This program could be great for New Yorkers and for the environment, but like much of what Mayor Bloomberg has done while in office, it is likely designed to make money off the middle class at the expense of bike shops."

NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,11/10/2014,After 6 months using the annual membership 1/ service is really bad as docks are many times not working or full of broken bikes 2/ they are increasing prices by +60% to 149$ 3/ just got charged for a ride that 'never ended' because of a dock problem; the lights never work and they just suggest you should each time get e receipt or call them to lock the bike properly.Definitely not renewing my membership next year.
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/26/2015,THEY SHOULD PROBABLY MAKE IT MORE CLEAR THAT THERE IS A $100 SECURITY DEPOSIT EVEN IF YOURE JUST RENTING FOR AN HOUR. Called Citibike to ask why and they were like it was on the screen you missed. K yeah it probably was but clearly it wasn't clear because I wouldn't have $110 to ride a bike over the bridge. Customer service was super rude and they can't expedite the process. Ridiculous. Never again!!
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,07/26/2013,"It's a great idea, but seems to suffer from overwhelming demand.The pros are obvious, so I'll focus on the cons:1. It's absolutely impossible to find a bike in residential areas in the morning or in commercial areas in the early evening. You might as well be looking for winged unicorns. 2. The software registers broken bikes as ""available"" because they are in the docks. This is very misleading and leads to a lot of frustrating wandering from station to station looking for a bike. 3. Software glitches leave entire stations out of service. No bikes can be checked out when this happens, regardless of how full the station might be."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/01/2013,"citibike should be ashamed at the completely incompetent roll out of this service. Let me say that the idea of it is amazing and when it works I am a huge fan of the service. However, they cut out the old software company and we are all suffering because of it. I constantly get trips where the return is not credited so not only can I not get another bike without calling and waiting to speak to someone, but my credit card gets charged for overages that dont exist (even though they tell me it wont). My girlfriend just joined and after 3 weeks they charged her card $206 in overages that didnt exist!The app is completely inaccurate as far as where there are bikes and docks available which makes it worse than worthless."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/27/2013,"I'm giving two stars because the concept is obviously great- I'm really rooting for this to succeed. They need to improve their logistics. We took bikes from the lower east side to Williamsburg, where there were many people waiting at each station to re-dock their bikes. We had to dock them two miles away from our ultimate destination. There need to be more convenient stations set up to accommodate demand. I hope they continue to refine this concept in NYC. I did not have trouble finding convenient stations with available spots when I frequently used the city bike rental system in Paris."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/04/2014,"It was really nice to have access to bikes without having to bring them along to the city. I would have liked a 1 hr ride option rather than having to dock the bike every 30 minutes and then get it right back out. Numerous of the dock stations were broken. Many of the bikes seats were cracked, but not a huge deal. Will certainly make use of them again."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/18/2014,"I don't get the complaints.  I am sure we are subsidizing the complainers.  A hundred bucks a year.  They need to raise this, if for no other reason to be sure that it continues.  Sure, once in a while there aren't any bikes.  Heaven forbid you have to walk a block to get another one.  Raise the annual, lower the daily and hourly, keep it going.  They need better security, because I hear about teens, especially, able to wrest a bike off the racks."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/18/2013,Citi Bike is the worst. The system is completely broken and should be ripped out of NYC. I had to wait to dock my bike because 2 stations were completely full in Tribeca. The purchase process is ridiculously slow and you have to use Mastercard to purchase? What a racket.  I'm sorry but it is totally inconvenient and to top it all off I got a ticket because I was riding the Citi bike on the sidewalk which caused me to get charged extra for the rental! Citi Bike was the worst experience I have had in NYC in a long time. This is a complete waste and I know this will eventually fail because of the poor design. What a waste. Get your own bike and ride.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/18/2013,"Completely, utterly, wildly awesome. Opens up the city in so many ways.Money for what would have been a 25 minute walk, which a subway could only shave a few minutes off due to wait time. Citibike turns that into a 10-12 minute trip for no marginal cost once you've purchased an annual membership. The whole city feels smaller having the ability to make such great time between neighborhoods.Saves lots of scratch on subway tickets and is good exercise to boot. Best thing ever."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/25/2013,"It probably works better for annual members. I used it for 5 days last week with a week pass and found I wasted more time running from station to station trying to get bikes. If you only have a pass you have to run your original purchase credit card at a station for an unlock code that lasts 5 minutes. One station had a busted screen so you couldn't use it for a code, several others had out of order credit card readers. The App is supposed to tell you how many bikes and how many docks are available at each station and it was never accurate. There were almost always 3 bikes out of commission at a station.First morning I tried to use it the first station screen was busted so I moved to another station. I was able to purchase the week pass and get a code but the 5 bikes docked were locked with a red light saying they needed maintenance. I then found one more station with functioning bikes, but the credit card reader was out of service. Very frustrating. I learned from a year membership person that he has some sort of fob that gives him access without all this, but that didn't help him much as he was trying to park his bike at a completely full station which according to the App had 10 docks available. Very disappointing overall.I sent an email to complain and received an email back within a day saying that my email was received and to please join their email list. Not likely. 5 days later, no other response."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/02/2013,"i wanted to love citibike but my experience was pretty meh. PROS:*docking stations are easy to find (EXCEPT there weren't any near SMORGASBURG in williamsburg so i had to walk quite a bit to get from the nearest docking station to the 'burg).*it is pretty dreamy to get on a bike, ride to your destination and then drop it off without having to worry about where to park itCONS:*the station just at the end of the williamsburg bridge (on the BK side) had TONS of broken bikes and i might even say all. so many so that i called the citibike phone number and after 10 minutes the representative finally found my account and advised me she didn't know why i was having trouble unlocking a bike. ANNOYING. i had people waiting for me and it really held up our day (add the ten minutes prior: trying to figure out what i was doing wrong and why i couldn't unlock a bike with my new code = 20 minutes late meeting friends).*the fact that you have to switch bikes after 30 minutes is annoying. they should have an option where you can rent for four hours or even eight hours. that way there's no stress and you're not setting your timer on your phone every few minutes.CITIBIKE: PLEASE MAKE IT BETTER! i can't tell you how many times i've passed a docking station and potential citibikers are hunched over, swearing at the kiosk because it won't accept their card or the touch screen isn't working."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/05/2013,"Loved this idea, especially because the MTA is getting worse and more expensive. There are tons of Citibike stations in my area and in most of the places I need to go, since I mainly move around below 40th street. They are awkward and heavy but get me around the short distances I need to go.Citibike maintenance needs to step up their game though. I have seen the same broken bike (broken chain) sitting on 32nd and Broadway today that I saw on Friday night! So that's 3 days later! Friday night there were no bikes available, so much that I ended up walking from 42nd street to 14th street because every station was empty or only had broken bikes docked. If you check the app it will tell you there are bikes there -but it seems like it was the broken bikes that it was indicating to me! The app definitely needs some work. I don't think it updates as quickly as you need it to in real time. This weekend I encountered a lot of other frustrated Citibikers as I had trouble re-docking because the docks were simply not taking the bikes, others had the same problem, and also complaining that the stations were full and they had to keep requesting time credits. Seems like the system doesn't work well for commuting...as much as it is good just for fun to take a quick ride around. Earlier today in Chinatown I ended up riding around with a group of 8 people who were all riding around trying to find stations to dock their bikes! Its a great idea! So its such a shame to not have it work as efficiently. NYC is a complicated city to accommodate with something like this, every station I had been at for the last 4 days had a gliche and/or angry people who were having problems with the bikes! From tons of broken bikes to having docks not take bikes or let go of them. On the plus side, I happened to check my account online and noticed that after returning a bike after a short ride, it did not register as ""returned"". I quickly called customer service, took about 10min to talk to someone, and I gave my key #, explained my story in detail about the particular ride and where I returned the bike, even though it didn't register the customer service person gladly fixed my account and took my word for it since I guess all the stations were glichy the whole weekend but at least she didn't try to blame me or charge me for it!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/17/2013,"So finally after months of curiosity about the whole Citibike craze, my boyfriend & I decided to try it.So went for the full days pass at $10.00 a bike. First of all you hv to be a rocket scientist to understand the instructions. We stood at the stand for 10 minutes trying to decipher the instructions. Finally after getting the bikes out with the code they gave us, we went on to enjoy our ride through Brooklyn & prospect park. But what we thought was a great ride for a great price turned out to be a complete scam. When my boyfriend got his bill, the charge was not $20.00 but $180.00 for both bikes, which was outrageous. So what is not completely clear when you go to get the bike, is that although it's $10.00 for the day, you have to check in every 30 minutes, re-dock your bike, put in the same code & get the bike back out, which is ridiculous since docking stations are not installed in every neighborhood in the city. So what are you suppose to do? Stop what you're doing to go search for a docking station? Come on man!So when my bf called to explain & fight the charge, the customer service person said the bikes are not for leisure but for commuting around the city. Are you kidding me? Even if you did only use them to commute around the city, with New York City traffic, it's nearly impossible to get anywhere in 30 minutes.These bikes have only been a way for the city & citibank to scam you out of your money. Money for the city in all the tickets they have wriiten since they've been installed, and money for citibank for keeping the instructions obscure which are sure to confuse to buyer & they end up paying more. Needless to say, we will not be using these bikes ever again but investing in our own.DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY!!!!!One thing to note is that the actual company that runs this is NYC Bike Share LLC. through Citibank."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/01/2013,"DO NOT USE CITIBIKE!!!!My boyfriend and I got the one day access pass but we were charged double the price as they claimed that we were over by 30 secs - 1 min for two of the trips. Upon returns of the bikes, there were no receipts provided to prove the duration or the return of the bikes; thus, they can say whatever they want! They simply made the decision and blocked my email address so that I cannot inquire further. This was the worst customer service I have ever gotten. Assuming timers were correct, for simply less than 4 minutes, a price of $20 was charged! And we were certain that we arrived at the bike stations with minutes to spare and if anything, those couple seconds overtimes were due to issues with the bike racks as some of them did not accept the return of the bikes properly. The UNREASONABLE charges and POOR customer service certainly ruined part of the trip! This definitely poorly reflects citibanks line of business. I will never rent a bike from them again!!!"
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,07/29/2013,"Ok, I have to give some stars for the system and bikes. They are in very good shape and easy to ride.This service is a must in all cities nowadays and operations should be flawless by now... it is not the case:- Their system does not print your code after your first ride. Not a big deal, but they could tell you that... be aware. Meh- App does not reflect availabilities in real time. So you show up somewhere you think there are enough bikes... and there is not enough. Meh Meh- Card reader did not work at several locations. So you go to a place, try to get bikes and can't because they cannot read your card... Meh Meh Meh!!! Very frustrating and waste of time, especially when you want to head back to your hotel to catch your flight... - Customer service: well, we had no idea that the card reader was faulty so we called customer service and asked for help. They had no idea of what was going on and after 2 or 3 minutes they told us verbatim that they had other customers on the line waiting and as we were not a yearly subscriber they had no time for us and hung up. That's it! I wonder why they have a customer service... useless, irritating, and very rude to say the least. So if you have plenty of time, ready to walk some blocks to find a bike, and ready not to call customer service in any circumstances, it's ok."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/22/2013,"Great Service... BUT, CitiBike's ability to service the current customer base is overshadowed by their greed to sign up members. They tout 90,00 members, yet only have approximately 6,000 Bikes; what are the odds of finding a bike using their crystal ball app?ZERO availability at Penn Station and surrounding areas during early morning commute.... and Zero Bikes avaialable in Midtown East in the reverse commute. ABSURD!Stop enrolling people and taking money for no service. Local politicians, as expected could care less... and turn a deaf ear to this issue. Perhaps the new Controller wanna be - Stringer (if he wins)  will investigate this take the money and run scheme."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/27/2014,"Bike in bad condition; terrible customer service. I picked up a bike at Central Park South. I immediately discovered that the seat did not tighten properly and turned left and right as a rode. Then, when I was halfway to Tudor City, the chain got stuck, broke, and fell off in the street. I had to walk the bike the rest of the way.When I called customer service, there was no apology, they just told me they would send someone to fix the bike. When I asked for some discount, they apologized. I repeated that I wanted a discount. The customer service rep checked and said sorry, not possible. Since when are customers expected to pay full price for a faulty product? The only good thing about my experience was that I only bought a 24 hour pass to try it out. Bike share is a great idea, but this is poor execution."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/21/2013,Absolutely fantastic operation for manhattan- bike trails are easily marked. $9.99 for a day rental- but set your timer on watch and switch bikes after 30 minutes to avoid overcharges. There are racks everywhere in the city/ get app to see where. We picked up bike in village- rode down west side highway ( all for bikes! Along river/ gorgeous!!! ) parked bike in citibike rack at Staten island free ferry/ took round trip boat ride- saw Statue of Liberty/ then got new bike and rode up east side by river to 34 th then up first ave.

Finding a dock in daytime popular areas, like SoHo, is nearly impossible. Finding a bike near Penn Station before noon is very difficult.I still use my own skateboard/bicycle to commute. I use the Citibike for daytime errands only.It still beats a car, but like the car, you'll have problems finding a parking spot."

NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/18/2013,"I really wanted to like this service.  But it was really frustrating. Touchscreens did not work at two stations.  When I finally got a touchscreen to work, neither of the two bikes at the station were open to riding. After 20 minutes of messing around with the system, I had my credit card entered, but no bike ride.  The iPhone app was unclear and unhelpful in identifying other stations to potentially use to ride.  Customer service did refund the charge, but I never got to ride a bike. As I say, I wish it had worked.  But for me it was an exercise in frustration.  Hopefully they can work out the kinks with the system because it is a really great idea"

I love the concept, so I gave it 2 stars."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,11/20/2013,"This is a mixed review.  I got a day pass when in New York recently.  The price was right, $10 day, and I certainly got my money's worth.  The bikes are great, sturdy with three speeds that ride very nicely.  They are equipped with bells, automatic flashing lights and a nice place to put small packages on the handlebars.  The payment kiosks are pretty easy to use and there seem to be plenty of stations around the city.The problem comes with the limited 30 minute trip.  It became a real game to get where I wanted to go and return the bike to a kiosk in 30 minutes especially when the mobile app wasn't loading and it's hard to consult your phone when you're riding a bike!  I think an hour long trip would be much more reasonable especially with the day pass that it seems would be used more by tourists.  I hope they fix this glitch. Otherwise, kudos to NY for this new program!"

Hope they will bring the quality up to par with DC at some point."

It is inexpensive and reliable and has changed the way that I use the city. A lot of people complain about empty stations on occasion or bikes that are broken. This is true, but I you will also find headaches and problems on the subway, bus or in a car.  No system of transportation is perfect.I think this system works as well as other bike share programs that I have used (Montreal, Tel Aviv and D.C)."

Everything worked out well for me, except for a few times when the machines would inexplicably not read my credit card (for the week pass you have to swipe or ""dip"" your card each time to get a new code for the bike). Well about twice the stations weren't reading my card and it wasn't just me and it wasn't just one station. The first time it was about six stations, so I called up Citi Bike and they couldn't do anything for me. The next time the exact same thing happened. I'm guessing there is a bug in the system, but who knows. There are a lot of bike stations across the city so finding a station isn't an issue. But if you want to do anything north of 60th St you are out of luck, as well as parts of Brooklyn. Once they expand and fix all the bugs it will be a good system. Right now it's just an ok system. Note: NYC drivers can be really aggressive, but I didn't really feel in danger at any time and I rode all the way from Williamsburg to the south side of Central Park. All the one way streets are confusing so your best bet is to get an app where there is a bike map so you can plan it."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/07/2013,"it showed so much progress but it seems that the software is a total FAIL !!! App is never accurate as to when bikes are available or docks available.

What gives  as that is suppose to be whole beauty of the program??(its apparently ""a known it problem"" ... Ya think.. for two months ?

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/08/2014,I would give less but don't ever rent a bike from them as they bang u with overtime charges so instead if being 9.95 day. How about more like 25.00 per day a bunch of BS  no wonder they still building banks in every corner.  SCAM
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/28/2014,this has been my main mode of transport for the past 6 months. everyday i commute across a bridge and don't have to worry about the bike.  i work early so i don't usually have an issue finding a bike or finding an open dock...about 95% of the time.    but i think if my work hours were different it wouldn't be as convenient.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/28/2014,"I live in Brooklyn but had to relocate to Manhattan for one week. A great time to try Citibike! Wrong. It took nearly 45 minutes just to buy the weekly pass. Two sets of German tourists had the issues and we walked to 4 different stations before we found a machine that would work properly. Unfortunately the codes they spit out to unlock the bikes did not work. The help desk was unhelpful and pretty much useless and you are on hold for an eternity. More than the yearly memberships, it is the daily and weekly rentals which will keep this enterprise afloat, but one year+ in and they don't have a clue on how to operate. When I finally got codes to work(usually the 3rd or 4th code works) most of the bikes were in terrible shape and docking stations wouldn't accept the bikes. Clearly the machinery is not handling the elements well. About as bad as trying to use a credit card on parking meter kiosk, none of them work. Too bad. they need to fire every top exec at Citibike, rip out the existing system and start over."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/25/2014,"DO NOT USE CITIBIKE. First time I used it and got a 1 Day Pass. I docked the bike every half hour and got a new bike each time with a new code from Columbus Circle to Brooklyn. I was charged $108! They said I never docked a bike I got from BK and their system did not show I docked/got a new bike every half hour! Crazy! I can't believe their system doesn't show that. Also, the machine in Brooklyn to get a new code did not work. I tried several times inserting my credit card each time and it wouldn't process. Their system does not show that either! Also, they should get cameras at each station to show the bike was docked. NOT COOL at all. If I had known i'd be charged  $108 - I wouldn't have docked it and got a new bike every 30 minutes. SO ANNOYING. They would not give my money back. I'm going to call them again. I went with my boyfriend who has an annual pass so hopefully this will help when they look up his history in the system versus mine. So ridic!!!!!! Citibike, go rip off a criminal not an innocent person."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/09/2013,"I love Citibike. I use it to commute from home in Brooklyn to my office in Downtown Brooklyn, or if I'm working in Manhattan, I bike to the subway instead of taking the bus. it means I get an extra 15 minutes of sleep in the morning. Occasionally all the slots are full at the bike rack I use by the courthouse in Brooklyn, but otherwise I haven't had a problem getting or returning a bike. I've biked in Manhattan a few times in Midtown, which was pretty hair raising. I don't know that I'll bike there too often. I love having a bike without having to worry about storage or security. As other people have pointed out, Citibikes are heavy, and they're not fast."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/08/2013,"I highly recommend trying out Citibike. I love owning my Bianchi bike, but I will absolutely continue to use Citibike when needed. On my 24-hour adventure, I loved the convenience of docking it and not worrying about where to park and lock my own bike. There was a momentary glitch when some other patrons and myself were unable to get the bikes out of the docks but customer service was easy to reach by phone and were extremely friendly and helpful (the way customer service should be). After about 5 minutes, the kiosk was back to working order. I biked over the Manhattan Bridge, the Brooklyn Bridge and rode along the Hudson River. I had a great and inspiring time. I've visited over ten bike shops over the past few weeks and each employee I spoke to fully supports Citibike and said it has not hurt business; it has helped business with cyclist buying helmets, biking bags and accessories. So there you go."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/23/2014,"Don't bother!  A wonderful idea ruined by poor planning.  They are supposed to have staff that ""re-balance"" the stations, but there are never any bikes available so what's the point?  One argument is that it's inexpensive, but I don't know anyone who wants to throw money away; even if it's only a dollar.  It is a rare occurrence when I can actually find a bike and the stations and bikes are in very poor repair.  The app does not update often enough and the telephone reps are nice by not at all knowledgable about the system they are there to service.  A waste of money and I will not renew.  I'm better off purchasing a foldable bike which I can bring to work."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,02/14/2014,"Okay, let me provide an updated review of my Citibike experience. See the original post below for the entire history revolving around an improper overage charge of $108 during the snow storm, after half the bikes were off the road due to snow, and many of the docks were busted. They claimed I did not dock the bike correctly; I stated that I had called customer service to be sure, and had been told that I have no open trips. My credit card company contested the charge, Citibike claimed they had ""proof"" I failed to dock the bike, I raised a complete stink (again, see below), posted angry messages on their Facebook page with photos of the snow-covered docks, filed a complaint with the Department of Consumer Affairs, and requested mediation from the Small Claims Court division. After all that, Citibike called me three times today and left voice mail messages, the last of which stated that my refund would be processed. So yes, it all worked out in the end, but it was awfully time-consuming for me, and involved me unloading a ton of Mega Bitch on them, which was really unpleasant for me as I am not a hateful person set out to destroy Citibike. I just don't want them to rip me off. Despite this terrible experience, I would still recommend Citibike. It has its perils - very often the docks are either empty, or full, making it impossible to get a bike or return one. Their redistribution algorithm needs a lot of improvement. Even in good weather, docking's not so easy and requires brute force as well as finesse. The advantage is that the yearly  membership fee is really cheap. It will pay for itself in all the saved subway and bus fare. The bikes are sturdy, easy to ride, and easy to see even at night. Generally, except for my one terrible experience with the overage charge, customer service is good, you can always get through to the hotline. My biggest complaint is busted docks - those with electronic problems, as well as those that are just plain broken because they weren't built to withstand the ramming necessary to dock a bike. But overall, it's a convenient service for New Yorkers and I hope they expand it to upper Manhattan. ORIGINAL POST: Do not let these scammers have your credit card and especially not your debit card. You will rack up hundreds of dollars in ""overage"" even if you properly dock the bike, and Citibike will not refund these charges even when they know perfectly well that you docked correctly. You will have no choice to open a fraud investigation with your bank or credit card company. That is not to say that Citibike isn't convenient - it is. The question is, do you want to let a bunch of scammers steal hundreds of dollars in fees from you in return for that convenience?UPDATE: Citibike won their case against me in the fraud complaint division of my bank, so they scammed me out of $108, despite the fact that I called to ask if I had any open trips and they said No, no open trips. For all I know, someone at Citibike just pocketed this $108. Definitely do not let these scammers get a hold of your credit card."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/28/2015,"BEWARE!!! CitiBike is a huge ripoff!  The concept is great; however, the requirement that the bike needs to  be checked back in to a kiosk every 30 minutes makes the whole process inconvenient, and renting a bike pointless.  I purchased a 24-hour rental for a friend to ride around Dumbo, but actually used the bike for only 4 hours.  Long story short, they charged me an additional $93 dollars because I ""did not return the bike every 30 minutes.""  (Words of the customer service rep.)  What's the purpose of renting a bike for 24 hours if it needs to be returned every 30 minutes!!! I will stick to Bike and Roll or one of the other more reasonable bike rental services going forward.  Never again."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/13/2013,"Completely false and misleading advertising on price of rentals.  Heavy, slow bicycles.  Difficult kiosk system.  My boyfriend and I couldn't wait to return our bikes and continue exploring NYC on foot."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/13/2013,"The software they use is very glitchy.  I have an annual membership.  In order to take a bike, you first have to find an available bike at a dock (obvious), then you have to check if any of the lights on the dock are illuminated (if they are, you likely won't be able to unlock the bike), finally you have to insert your key into the slot in the dock and leave it there until the light turns green.  Once it's green, you lift the bike up by the seat to unlatch the lock, then you can lower it again and remove it from the dock for riding.  Don't forget to take your key back!  Pros:1.  Annual membership is not prohibitively expensive.  2.  The allotted 45 mins between docking is adequate and in line with the whole bike share premise.  3.  Bikes feel solid like tanks.4.  Better than walking.5.  Cool app.  I guess I'm one of the few people who actually like the official app.Cons:1.  30 minute limit for daily/weekly passes is kind of bs.  'Dock surfing' or 'daisy-chaining' will almost be a necessity, lest you're willing to pay the overage fees.2.  Bikes are heavy and don't track in a straight line particularly well.  3.  Sometimes entire dock stations are down.  4.  Sometimes, when you return a bike, their computer doesn't register the return.  It docks and locks fine, but if you check at the kiosk, or on your account online, there is no record of the return.  In these instances, I had to call customer service to get it corrected.  The hold times aren't terrible and they were always able to correct it without fuss but the fact that I have to keep calling them because of their faulty software/infrastructure sucks.  At least I'm an annual member and can readily see their inaccurate records by logging into my account online.  I'd hate it if I was a daily/weekly pass user and didn't find out about it until citibike billed me.5.  I wish I could access my account from the app.  That way, I don't have to use the kiosk to determine if their computers logged the return of the bike.The fact that this isn't their first rodeo -- as I understand it, the same company is responsible for bike share programs all over the world -- says to me that they're not going to, or maybe they're unable to, fix the glitches.  I can't believe that their other bike share systems in place don't experience the same issues."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/11/2014,"I like that this business is creating more bikers, but the system seems to be run by idiots. Checking in and locking up simply doesn't work at some stations. Customer service is horrendous, and refunds are passively denied by putting the caller on indefinite holds."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/13/2014,Citibike changed my life. It reduced the time and money that I spend on the subway considerably. The bikes themselves are quite comfy and speedy enough for NYC. The stations are placed conveniently for both commuting and for just getting around town. It takes a few weeks to really get good at knowing where the stations and when to worry about full or empty  bike racks. Citibike is the best thing to happen to NYC since I moved here 22 years ago.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/24/2013,"This review is purely for the customer service department. I was told by a Citibike employee at an event that if you signed up for the annual membership that it would take about 2 weeks to receive your access card. But have no fear, he told me- just call customer service and they'll provide you with a 7 day access code to access your bike sooner. So I signed up and called customer service. Although the people on customer service, both the lady who answered the phone, and the ""team leader"" were very nice- neither were helpful. They told me they could not provide me with an access code, even though a team member had told me so. Although they wanted to fix the problem moving forward, they said they could do nothing for me. Citibike is already getting a really bad reputation in the City, and this does not help the situation. If they have team members telling people information on the streets, they need to follow through with it. Unfortunate customer service."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/24/2014,"I would say the pros outweigh the cons here. I have using Citi Bike for a year now and I can honestly say it has improved my life and saved a truck load of money. I had the membership paid off in 3 months of not taking the subway. I have always wanted my own bike but honestly this is so much better. I work up at 38th and Broadway, last year there were never any bikes at those stations and I'd have to walk to 33rd street. Its not that big a deal to walk a few blocks to get a bike. This summer has improved I can now get a bike about 50% of the time--at rush hours. Much better and much faster and much more enjoyable then being on a hot subway platform."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/15/2013,"I thought that the Citibikes were a great idea, but was surprised and disappointed by what a bad, ineffectual system it is. I live in NYC and have my own bike, but my boyfriend and I wanted to try them out. We tried three times to use the bikes before giving up. The first time, the touch screen we tried was completely impossible to operate, even though the system had only been operational for 3 weeks. Yes, we could have gone to another site, but just ended up taking the subway. The second time, the code that was given for the bike didn't work. I tried it on every single bike in the rack, but none would open. I called the helpline and all they could do was re-set the code, not refund the money, which I wanted because I had lost all faith in this system. But one day a friend was visiting and we tried the bikes again. He has a Citibank Mastercard, the ""preferred card"" according to the Citibike computer, but his payment ""couldn't be processed.""So I am very surprised that so many people use these bikes. The fact that you have to dock your bike every 30 minutes, and clearly there are WAY too many kinks in the process of getting a new bike out of the rack, means this needs some serious improvement if it is ever going to be viable. It would never work for people who have to be somewhere at a certain time, if you have to worry about all of these issues. Maybe it would be acceptable for very patient tourists who have plenty of time to fart around, but not for anyone else. Very disappointing."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,02/23/2014,"A WORD TO THE WISE....DO NOT RIDE CITI BIKE... their docking stations dont work and will run up your time and charge you past your 30 minutes to receive more of your money. When calling to report, they have you on the phone for a long time and are rude. Their customer service sucks, I called to explain that their bikes were not docking correctly and was told their was nothing they can do about it and the charges will remain on your card. It is def not worth the hassle. I will NEVER ride with them again."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/18/2014,"Bought two day passes for me and my bf to use while we were visiting NYC. Figuring out the costs was confusing, initially thinking we had to wait 30 mins before taking out a new bike but then realizing we just needed a new access code. We biked across the manhattan bridge and went to insert the bike, we made sure they were locked in. We walked and explored for about an hour and then tried to get another pair of bike to get back to our hotel. We received a message on the kiosk saying one of the bikes was not returned! I called the help line, the lady while polite was not very helpful. I asked her what I would be charged & what my options were. She basically told me that I had to wait for someone to get the bike and redeposit it another station or go back and check for it. In fear of the bike getting stolen and my card being charged, me and my bf decide to take a taxi from Soho back to the manhattan bridge costing me $13. Get there and the bike is locked in perfectly! Call back and the agent asks for a barcode number and says shell close the trip. This was a total inconvenience for us and costed us $13. This was very disappointing. I would recommend if you do get a day pass for CitiBike to make sure right away thats it locked and you can access another pass code to get another bike. Hopefully they work out these tweaks because ultimately this concept of bike sharing is great."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/09/2013,Disaster.  Got hit by a cab. The locations they chose to put the kiosks are redic. In major traffic areas with lots of opportunities for accidents.   The bike was returned late because of the accident and this heartless company refused to refund the extra time.  BIG SKIP for me!  And I live in NYC ! They ONLY care about $$.  Terrible!
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/06/2013,"Would like to reduce it down to 1 1/2 but I can't.After over two months, one would have thought citibikes would have had time to work out its kinks.  However, they just seem to only get worse.  Again, it is a great program in concept but the actual execution has been shockingly poor for a city like NYC which tends to get other things right. A huge part of the problem lies in the pathetically AWFUL software (seriously, heads need to roll at the company that put this turkey out) that runs Citibikes.  I read that this had to do with a licensing dispute Alta (which runs Citibikes and similar programs in other cities) had with its previous software developer.  Understood.  But did it have to resort to going to what is obviously an untested developer to develop the software for the largest bikeshare system in the US????  The only other city using this same software system is Chattanooga, TN.  Chattanooga!!!  Software aside, there are also other issues like poor placement of the docks and the fact that docks seem to come in only two varieties - fully loaded with bikes so that you can't dock, or completely empty so you can't get a bike.  To make matters extra annoying, some docks can go from completely full one night to completely empty the next for no reason at all.  Anyway, I've detailed some of the issues with citibikes below.1) A Multitude of Malfunctioning Equipment. - I can't count how many times, I've pulled up to a dock stand, found one of the rare docks still open and tried to dock and only found that the reason the dock was open was because it was broken and did not allow the bike to be docked.  Part of the problem seems to me to be the fact that people - not knowing how to dock their bike (you have to lift it first and then drop it and allow the dock to latch it) - have taken to brute force slamming the bike into the dock.  No doubt this has led to many a broken dock.  The problem stems from the docks being designed so as to make it unnecessarily hard to dock the bike.  At the very least, some instruction on how to dock is needed and I'm surprised that the stands provide no such instruction. With that said, the bigger problem is software-related.  Again, it's that AWFUL software.  I've come across many stands where ALL the docks had a red LED light on - meaning that the bike docked in cannot be released because either the dock or the bike or both are not working.  Then there are the stands where 1/3 or 1/2 of the docks have the red LED.  Why so many?  My only guess is that citibikes is not maintaining their docks/bikes.  Once broken, they remain broken and thus there's a backlog of broken docks/bikes.  Needless to say, the generally poorly maintained and busted equipment make the entire program unreliable.  Basically, the program is like a lemon car.  You can't count on it getting you from point A to point B without breaking down.  In other words, you can't count on getting a bike at point A due to broken docks which would release a bike and you can't count on there being a functioning dock at the other end which can receive your bike.2) Dock Blockage - ANother major problem is that many dock stands are just full constantly and it is a struggle to find a stand with empty docks in certain neighborhoods - Midtown during the day, West Village, East Village and Battery Park City at night.  Again, this defeats the purpose of citibikes if you can't rely on there being an open dock to park your bike at.  Despite people saying that a lot of this is due to the unique density of NYC, a huge part of the problem is related to poor location of the dock stands (which I get into in 3) below.3) Poor locations of dock stands - It seems that, in deciding where to put the docks, they decided to randomly dump them wherever they felt that they would be the least opposed.  The locations make no logical sense.  For example, why are there NO stands at all in the FiDi west of Broadway????  Then you have Battery Park City which has large residential complexes and large office complexes served by only three stands.  Also, why are there so few dock sands along the very popular Hudson River and East River bike paths?????????????  There are two, count then TWO, bike stands along the Hudson river bike path (Chambers St and 42nd St) and THREE along the East River bike path (Staten Island Ferry terminal, Pier 11, and 35th St).  Then, if you're riding along the East River and looking to continue past 34th St, you must take a detour up First Avenue to get around the UN.  Again, this is another popular bike route.  However, the first stand on First Ave after you pass 34th St isn't until you get to 44th St!!!!  4) The App - AWFUL!!!!!!  This one is shamefully bad.  It is absolutely painful to use since it takes forever to load and the map takes forever to move around.  What's more, it is completely inaccurate.  It is always showing open docks where there aren't any."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/02/2013,literally twenty seconds over the time limit because the docking station we went to was full.I Contacted customer service via phone and they informed me that i had to email to try to get this waived. They emailed me back saying that they couldnt waive this but a friend of mine was thirty seconds over and it got waived? hmmm shady practice I will never use this again and inform my friends of this scheme they have going
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/29/2013,"The concept of Citi bikes is awesome for those who are tired of waiting for a train in those overheated platforms. However, the Citi bike definitely took some time getting used to.  I am a short person standing at 5'0 ft tall.  Even with the seat adjusted to the lowest, my feet could barely touch the ground.  Although, it was fun riding the bike, I did always have to think twice every time I stopped to ensure my foot actually touched the ground and I wouldn't fall over.  It would be nice if the bikes were built for those who are vertically challenged as I am."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/31/2013,"What a rip off! Don't use this bike share program. Local bike shops are much better. If you go over 30 minutes you start getting charged more more more!!!! No wonder Citi bank is involved, they are getting so much $ from people going over 30 minutes!!! Don't use it--stay with local bike shops who are fairly priced, and provide helmets, too!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/11/2015,"Super misleading. We rented two bikes for 1 hour and a half thinking we had a 24 hour pass for each bike. After checking my credit card statement, I found 3 charges. One for $202 as a credit hold to be returned (never warned about), the $22.00 for the 24 hour pass, AND a $54 charge for using both bikes for longer than 30 minutes under the understanding that we had them for 24 hours (never warned about). What?! How can you market your pricing structure as $10 for 24 hours but then only allow your customers to use the bike for 30 minutes without incurring additional fees. That is so misleading and straight up criminal! Nowhere did it say that the bikes were good for only 30 minutes within the 24 hour period that we thought we got them for. I feel bad for people who rent them for the full 24 hours and are paying upwards of $500 thinking they only have to pay $10. You could buy a bike with the amount it takes to rent this piece of crap for a full day. Please don't use this service!"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/20/2013,"I tried Citibike last Saturday because I won a 24hr pass at the Summer Streets event. Overall I think that the system is a great idea but needs a lot of work. To begin with, finding a bike rack with bikes can be challenging. There's a station right in front of my building and every time I go out there's only one or two bikes docked and at least one of them happens to be out of order. Also, the machine's software is very buggy so it took forever to get a bike in the first place. The person in front of me bought a daily pass yet the machine wouldn't read his card when he requested a new code so that was $10 wasted. The 30 minute limit per ride is also annoying because you always have to be aware of where you're going to dock the bike. If you're in midtown or lower manhattan, finding a station is not that hard but in other areas the number of stations is lacking. I feel like the program will be better once it grows and becomes more widespread throughout the city. I did enjoy riding the bike up 1st ave and down 2nd ave because of the green bike lanes which make riding less stressful."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/11/2013,"let's count the ways how terrible citibike is1. all bike racks are empty or broken2. when you can get a bike, impossible to return because racks are broken or filled3. real-time app is not real-time and shows inaccurate dataso basically citibike makes my life more inconvenient because i have to go out of my way to find a bike and return a bike, completely useless"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/16/2015,"The concept is great, but in practice it doesn't work. All summer I've wanted to use the bikes but have not been able to. Why? Because they don't ""balance"" the stations. Too many times, every bike station in the area of one's destination has no available docks, or two few to count on there being one available when you arrive. I learned this the hard way one night when I spent 30 minutes searching for a free dock and ended up almost as far away from my destination as I started. Other stations have no bikes. They are supposed to ""rebalance"" the docking stations routinely every day to avoid these problems, but they don't spend the money to do it. At this point, I have found that about 70% of the time that I want to use the bikes I can't because docks at stations near locations I'm going have no slots. I've called to complain several times about particular areas. As far as I can tell, this accomplishes nothing; days after the complaints all stations in the union square area have virtually no free docks. Then they charge you a large fee for a key that you can use for ""unlimited"" rides. It's beyond annoying that they don't offer reasonable memberships in which you pay per ride, so that they are only compensated if they can offer you a service. Just be aware that if you buy a membership, it won't provide you unlimited rides. And if you pay per ride they make it cumbersome and absurdly expensive. Take the subway!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/24/2013,"Great idea and will be a wonderful asset to the city. Teething problems have to be resolved.Two of us tried the 24 hour pass on Sunday.Pros:Bikes are comfortable and in good condition3 gears; a bell; a carrier rack; seat easy to adjustThe Citi smartphone app is very good - it shows the number of bikes and available slots at each docking stationCons:The initial sign-up takes far too long and is confusing e.g. at one point they say hit 'Next' and 'Next' is nowhere to be found; it's a forward arrow.As a result, at popular docking stations, the lines are long and move slowly.Using a day pass, we ran into three very different problems: - trying to return a bike within the 30 minute-deadline, no slots available at first station we tried, headed to a second station and were told by others leaving that it was full, had difficulty finding a third station until we realized it was on the other side of the street. Once we got there, a family of French tourists were having a terrible time trying to get bikes. So we were about 15 minutes late.- tried to return a bike later in the day and the empty slots weren't 'accepting' the bikes. You can't leave a bike that is not firmly held by the docking station.- After scurrying to an alternative station, we returned the bikes successfully but then despite multiple attempts, no bikes were being released; others at the same station had the same problem including one person with an annual membership.Eventually we just got on a bus up 10th Avenue.I think that 30 minutes is too short particularly for tourists who don't know how long it takes to get from one attraction to another. You've barely got your bike and you have to start worrying about the mechanics of returning it.Another issue - and not one that the city can resolve - tough to be so reliant on an app on a bright day when you can't see your screen easily.If you run out of juice on your smartphone, you are dead in the water.For tourists, who I assume are mostly using wireless, the inability to use the app would be a problem.I'd give it a whirl but only if you are relaxed and don't have to worry about meetings or other commitments.It can only get better."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/24/2013,"Customer service is terrible!My husband and I rented out two bikes for the very first time and unfortunately misread their misleading pricing.  We were under the impression that you pay $9.95 for a 24 hour period.  In a different section, it says that you can only have the bikes for 30 minute periods.  Their kiosks are not even placed at eye level.  We returned the bikes after 2.5 hours, thinking we were within our time alloted, and later saw a $154 charge on our credit card!  I called customer service to inquire about the charge and asked for some sort of break as it is insane to pay $154 ($120 +$34 in tax!) for a 2.5 hour bike ride.  Any large company forgives first time mistakes and works with their customers.  The representatives I spoke to were condescending and heartless, and did nothing to help us with this insanely high charge.  This is a big rip off.  We will only be renting bikes from local businesses in the future!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/23/2013,Terrible experience stations broken- had to go to three different stations to dock bike and then to find out a month later I was charged $30 for 4 minutes of overtime.  When I called to customer service they told me I should have requested the extra 15 minutes of time.  Nice theory if the station would have worked and been able to swipe my card to request.  Customer service rude and no credit given back. I will continue to write reviews as until justice is done.  Reading the other reviews I'm not alone
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/08/2013,"First time riding a citibike and sorely disappointed.  My first bike station was near Fulton Street. Lo and behold, the code does not work for both my husband and I. Customer service is called and they tell us to walk over to another bike station. After wasting about fifteen minutes in the first bike station, we walk about fifteen minutes for the second bike station. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? The credit card reader is out of service. I was frustrated but I wanted to experience riding a bike on the Brooklyn Bridge. We take another ten minute walk and finally find another citibike station. Finally, my code works but my husband has to call customer service again because his code does not work. I realize that the bike is too high for me even after I have adjusted the seat. THIS BIKE IS NOT MEANT FOR SHORT PEOPLE(rides better if you are above 5'5 in height). I had lots of trouble riding this bike because my feet would have difficulty touching the ground when I had to stop. It was too bulky and heavy. Too expensive for long rides if you do not switch bikes after 30 minutes! Will not be renting from this service again!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/24/2019,"Reasonable price, very easy to rent and the bikes rode great.   Can't wait to ride them again."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/16/2019,MAKE SURE YOU READ EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU RENT. Misleading rate information. The whole instruction and pricing structure is to manipulate first time riders to think the day membership let's you keep the bike for the day. Later you'll find that even though you paid for 24h you can only take the bike 30 minutes at a time before they charge you additional fees. Found out later of their pricing then the next day I was charged 32$ for the additional time on the bike.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/17/2019,"I agree with those saying that you need to READ THE SMALL PRINT! My boyfriend and I went on a ride for a few hours on a nice day and were charged $75! The machine was telling us it would just be $15, but apparently that was just for the first 30 minutes. I later read online that this service is more like a ""Lyft for bikes,"" so you are only supposed to take the bikes for 30 minutes or less, otherwise you have to re-dock them every 30 minutes to avoid facing huge overcharges. This was not clear when we checked the bikes out. I felt that overcharges were very misleading. Luckily, the company will reimburse your charges the first time, so make sure you give them a call: 877-430-2453."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/15/2019,"I live in the DC area and we've used the service a couple of times. It's such a great way to show friends the city. We used them most recently a couple of weeks ago for about two hours. We went to dock the bikes (there are guidelines for this, you watch videos, etc. to learn how) and began receiving texts that the bike wasn't docked. We returned to the docking station to make sure it was docked and did all their ""checks"" -- the bikes were docked. We called Capital Bikeshare three times and emailed twice that night, trying to solve the problem, but got no response. The next day we FINALLY got in touch with them and they immediately told us we'd be subject to a $1,200 stolen bike fee (?!). I explained the situation, that we had checked the bikes and tried to resolve the issue, and they said someone had JUST found the bike (?!) so they would make the feee $60 instead. I continued to ask questions and before long, when it was clear they weren't interested in what I was saying, I asked for a customer service number and the name of the representative. She said she didn't have to give me any information and hung up on me. I then contacted Lyft, the company who owns Capital Bikeshare, and was totally ignored for two weeks after multiple customer service tickets. (Keep in mind, they require your credit card info before you ride so they can charge you for anything they want afterward.) Ultimately, these bikes are a fun and cool idea. But know that if you ride them you're opening yourself up to $1,200 in fees if ANYTHING goes wrong (even if their technology fails!) with absolutely no customer service. I am not willing to take that risk, and unfortunately will not be using these bikes again."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,02/18/2019,"Capital Bikeshare has demonstrated that a well run, well maintained system partnering private sector with government can work on a large scale. For the most part, the dockless competing bikeshare companies have come and gone. This is a testament to the viability and health of the dock stationed based system. There are so many stations that you never feel you're out of touch with a rental or a refresh on your ride. The bikes are well maintained and they fit taller riders well. I really enjoyed using the bikeshare during my visit to the city."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/05/2018,"Read before you rent! Every 30 minutes you must dock the bike. You cannot ride continuously for more than 30 minutes so plan your trips accordingly! Dock the bike every 30 minutes and check it out again. If you download the app it's easy to find a dock close to your destination. You can also see how many docks and bikes are at each location.  We rented these bikes several times on our 3 day trip in DC and had a wonderful time zipping through the city! Each ride is $2 for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes you will be charged late fees. I don't know how much the late charges are because all our rides were exactly 30 minutes or less. You can get an all day pass for $8 so if you plan on taking more than 4 trips that's a good deal. You still have to dock the bikes every 30 minutes. It's very easy to find a dock, but I do think 30 minutes is a bit ridiculous. They should make it 45 minutes. Most of the bikes are in good condition. They are very popular during the evenings for some reason. There are a few electric bikes floating around if you luck up on one. We had a hard time finding 2 bikes after sunset. Using the app we were able to monitor the nearest dock and find out when 2 bikes became available. The one positive about the 30 minute time limit is that a bike may be coming soon if you're waiting for one. However, this doesn't guarantee a bike is coming. If someone just needs an extra 30 minutes to ride they can dock and rent out the same bike again. There are a few bike lanes in DC, but unless you have a helmet or are very experienced riding alongside cars I wouldn't recommend the bike lanes. Plenty of people ride bikes and electric scooters on the sidewalks and there is enough room. Watch out for people that walk like they're drunk, are distracted by cellphones, people who take up the whole sidewalk, and people who are just completely oblivious to the world around them. I had fun using the bell and scaring people."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,02/13/2019,"The docks and bikes don't work also the promo codes. Lots of potential, sad how poorly run this system is. I'll be buying a bike."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/25/2018,"Bikes didn't dock properly, one went missing. Looking at a steep $1200 fine (wtf?) if it doesn't turn up. Ruined my DC trip. Be careful while returning bikes.Edit: bike was eventually returned. I called up customer service to cancel my day passes, which they complied with."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/29/2017,"Capital Bikeshare is another major city bike-share program that works quite well, IMHO.I've enjoyed city bikes in Montreal, Boston and D.C. and found them an excellent way to explore a city.To best enjoy the benefits of the program, I recommend visiting the Captal Bikeshare website to fully understand how it works - easier than standing at a Bikeshare kiosk trying to figure out what the heck you are supposed to do.The bikes themselves are built like tanks - they have to be.  As an avid rider of expensive bikes, I have a great appreciation for the bike-share beasts.  Frankly, I find them very stable and easy to handle.  I like the bell, flashing LED lights and the basket on the front of the bike - all quite useful. Most bikes are in decent shape, however some squeak and are a little more beat up than others.As far as billing, it's quite clear that the intent of these bikes are to use them for under thirty minutes at-a-time and there is a modest charge for 30+ minutes. During my recent afternoon exploration in D.C., I bought a 24 hour pass ($8) and used 9 different bikes with only one 30+ minute ride (additional $2).  Basically, $10 for several hours of riding, docking bikes, walking around and riding again.)So, if you like to get out and about and have a flair for adventure, Capital Bikeshare bikes are the ticket.  It's fun to plan a sightseeing adventure, grab a bike, roll from rack to rack and walk a bit in-between.5 stars from this cyclist!Oh, and bring your own helmet if you so desire."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/16/2018,"I love these bikes! $2 for 30 min isn't a bad price either! You can get to most major spots within a half hour of each other for sure so it's nice and remains semi-cheap. The bike racks for pick up and drop off are literally everywhere and they go around and pull some from the over populated racks and bring them to the low supply areas every once and awhile throughout the day so that everywhere always has some! It's a great way to get around especially if you don't have your own bike, they have Day, week and year passes too if you know you'll be using it a lot, which is helpful! They're easy to use and return and send you emails to confirm everything. Bikeshare in general is such a great concept!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/02/2019,"ZERO stars!!!!  Please don't commit to these shysters (my opinion).For a service that is supposed to provide convenience - it's nothing but a headache 95% of the time.  Pure frustration - broken bikes, docs that are full, so you can't return your bike and may have to visit numerous racks taking you far out of your way,,, keys that swell up for no reason and don't work, etc etc. and the customer service is a JOKE.  The fine print on a yearly contract - IF you call and ""cancel"" your membership, they keep your money --- no refunds!!!  and you are not allowed to take out bikes for the remainder of your term.  So, I called in a moment of frustration - to inform them a station was not working / or perhaps it was my key,,,and the agent suggested I try all 20 bikes on the rack / and or go to another rack.  LOL --- well, sure, that sounds reasonable!!!  I have all day to walk from rack to rack and insert my key at every bike.  NP!  That's exactly how I want to spend my time - in the cold rain no less!  (#*%@!!)So, when I said I'd like to cancel my membership in a moment of despair after three stations not working, lacking bikes, etc -- being a prepaid member -- the agent informed me - and I quote ""you can NOT cancel your membership, you are prepaid,, but, I can take you off auto-renewal"" - I asked - ""am I still able to rent bikes until the end of my term?"" - Her answer:  ""YES!"" ---- However, that is not the case.  Capital Bikeshare is NOT reinstating my membership for the remainder of PRE-PAID time left, AND they are suggesting I PURCHASE a new membership -- So double pay??!?!?!?!?    Let me think about that.  Ummmmm, NOOOOOOOOO!f-ing RIDICULOUS.I'm a long time member - and have put up with all the flaws in their system, and yet they don't have my best interests at heart...  it's very disappointing, as I think the concept is great in the city!!    It's a poorly run company with HORRIBLE customer service in my opinion.  And it is my advice to buy your own bike,, or seek another option.  I would definitely advise NOT to sign up for any contracts -- you could be out money, like I am.It's super disheartening to see they will not step up to the plate and do the right thing ---  refunding me or honoring the time left that I've PAID FOR..... I also see some positive reviews on here that I look a little sketchy to me - I've heard MANY horror stories of being overcharged etc.--  avoid Capital Bikeshare.. Try the scooters, etc.  Don't deal with a company that does not appreciate you!!!!  The only thing they provide is 100% frustration / 0% support."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,05/06/2017,"For my 1st time usage of Capital Bikeshare all went well. I wanted to walk the 2.5 miles & my co-worker wanted to bike it...she paid, easy compromise. I didn't hover while she used her credit card to obtain the print out code used to unlock the bike from the secured docking station. You have 15 seconds to input the code or you'll have to start over. Just my luck that Alex, a Bikeshare employee was present checking bikes. I took that advantage to ask the questions I do so well as a newbie. You can pay per trip, get a 24 hour pass or sign up for an annual membership...the 'under 30 minutes' is the key factor in what you will pay.  Over 3500 bikes within 440 stations & counting. If a bike is not rideable, he radios his counterparts, provides the information & then loads the bikes into the van...looked like a patty wagon on a positive note. These are not tour de france bicycles, yet they are comfortable enough to get you to where you are going. If you get tired before your destination, there are massive docking stations in close proximity to drop the bike off. How do you know how close a docking station is you may ponder? My co-worker has an App (real time programming) that shows where the nearest docking station is located & the availability.There's no colorful basket with streamers present, yet a bungee cord apparatus that securely holds your tote, briefcase or what have you. I appreciate the bike lanes, it's a small safeguard...using a helmet is a bigger one.  Back to the banter of walking & such, I asked my co-worker how she'd be able to ride in her pumps...just as easy as I rode in my dress. & we blended in amongst the masses of red bikes just fine."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/05/2018,Would rate 0 if I could. I took a bike trip with my friend on the Mt. Vernon Trail and paid almost 10 times as much as we thought. Did not understand the business model from the signs and don't understand how you're essentially buying another bike every 30 minutes with overage fees after already paying rental fees. I will never use this service again.P.S. be prepared to have customer services hang up on you at least twice before taking your call/calling back.
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,12/01/2016,"Bottom Line: A good concept that needs some refinement as does DC's bike lanes.I like the idea of communal rental bikes but I think Capital Bikeshare could execute a lot better.  For starters, the pricing and rules can be confusing.  First you have to purchase a membership and there are about five choices.  Next you pay by the minute but you have to redock the bike every so often or you'll get charged extra. So if your feet need a break and you want to ride a short distance to the closet Metro station it would cost about $8 which isn't worth it.Recently, because of the Metro Safetrak initiative Capital Bikeshare is temporarily offering $2 rides if you return the bike under 30 minutes.  If Capital Bikeshare adopts this model for the long term I think I would easily give it four stars.There are stations all over the DC area so that is great although the stations could be empty when you need a bike or full when you need to return one.  That is a bummer and probably means more walking. The bikes are durable which means they are heavy so no popping wheelies or Tour de France sprints.Helmets aren't available but are often needed. If you're a tourist wanting to cover lots of ground in the federal city you might want to consider renting a bike AND helmet through Bike and Roll.  I suspect they might even provide route maps.  Exploring DC by bike is great because you can get to places that are not accessible by the Metro like the Jefferson Memorial.About those helmets, biking parts of DC can be very challenging. You can't legally ride on sidewalks or even on the gravel paths along the National Mall. Although that isn't really enforced as evidenced by all of the people doing it, I'm a rule follower so I try to stick to the road.  The trick about that is you might find yourself riding in the wrong direction an extra 1/4 mile because you get stuck on a one way street or divided highway.  There are few dedicated bike lanes and they often run down the center of traffic lanes instead of along the shoulder."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/25/2018,"Very misleading 24h pass: you pay 8$ and can use the bike for 24h but what's only in the small print and really easy to overlook is that you have to put the bike in a docking station every 30 mins. If you keep the bike for longer than 30 mins they charge a service fee of another's 8$ each time you overrun. So we went for a longer bike ride, using 3 bikes total and paid 24$ despite having the 24h pass. Scam alarm! Already deleted my app and won't use Capital Bikeshare ever again."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/19/2018,"Code malfunctioned. Beware of unfair customer service policy. I paid for two 24-hr bike passes. However, the code would not release any of the bikes from their docks. When I called in, customer service said that their system showed that 2 bicycles had been released from the dock and that I was responsible for the bicycles even though I never took a bicycle out. When it became obvious that there was a glitch in the system (there was a discrepancy in my printed time slip and their data on when the bikes were released) ,  I was told that I would STILL  be responsible for two missing bicycles and that I'd have to file a police report for stolen bicycles which I never even undocked. Long story short, even after having proof that I never even released the bicycles, Capital Bikeshare would not refund me my two 24-hour passes because I had activated them on my first ride.  I am a strong supporter of the bike share program, but the system is flawed, and it has terrible customer service policy."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,09/05/2018,"For the most part, had a great experience with Capital Bikeshare during our trip to DC. We bought 2 3 day passes for us. Unfortunately the bike passes stopped working the end of the second day, and wouldn't allow us to log in. We tried from both our phones. We will be reaching out to CaBi's customer service, stay tuned! Another bad thing, *extremely* uncomfortable after biking for so long!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/08/2017,"As many have mentioned, read the information and instructions before purchasing.  We got the 3 day pass and never had any difficulties or extra charges with it.  The only two minor  difficulties we had was when one of the machines was was not touch screen sensitive, and the other was when there weren't any bikes left.  Very minor issues, that could be solved by going to a neighbouring bike share location. Please do keep in mind that they are free if your trip is under 30 minutes! It would be difficult if you're not on data to find the closest station, so I would recommend taking a picture of the map if you're not able to use data. Overall, cheaper than the Metro and best way to see DC! It was faster for us to ride bikes than wait for the metro at many of our destinations!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/06/2016,"What's with all the hate on here? I mean are these fake yelp reviews or what? I'm a fan. We enjoyed our bike ride and the system was easy to use. No scary bike stealing. No horror stories about fees. It was fine. There are bike stations all over. You'll be glad you rented a bike instead of walking or dealing with traffic. These are no frills tourist-y bikes, okay. Don't be trying to pull out your cervelo fanciness, okay?It'll pay off to look at the map and do some planning ahead. Sure, the fees can be confusing at first. And yeah I have to admit that it's crummy to try and return your bike only to find the rack is completely full. Minus one star."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/05/2018,First: Watch a YouTube video on how to use this system.Second: be very careful on learning the pricing.Third: download the app SpotCycle.Forth: buy you day or 3 day membership -rent your bicycle for short distances.Under 30min are no extra charge.This is a great way to see Washington DC.
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/18/2018,"I love the concept of Capital Bikeshare! I randomly decided to take a 5 mile bike ride one day. Great experience but I'd definitely make sure to know exactly where your destination CB station is. I had a brief moment of frustration when I didn't know where the station was and my phone had died so I couldn't use google maps. I eventually found the station and I docked the bike and continued my day. The second time I used CB was a bit more chaotic because when I docked the bike to return it, the light was green instead of red when I walked away. This is bad because the light is supposed to be red when you walk away. So I was still being charged and didn't know until I received a text hours later. I called customer service and I ended up having to go back to the docking station to find the bike to dock it correctly. It sounds like a nightmare but it wasn't that bad. The woman with customer service was very polite and patient. I was given a serial number to look for and when I found it  I was able to undock, then dock it back correctly. All charges were waived as well. I would definitely use CB again and remember when you dock the bike the light must be red! :)"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/07/2018,Beware.  You rent for 24 hours.  You MUST check in every 30 minutes and they do not tell you.  It started out being a wonderful way to tour DC but then quite a disappointment with hidden fees.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/27/2017,"SCAM ALERT!! READ THE FINE PRINT, BE CAREFUL. I do not support this company.I do not support this company based on principal of their shady business practices.I do not have enough bad things to say about this company, their people, and their practices...About a week ago, I first rented a bike to take to the grocery store. Starting off, the touch screens were broken and it was a very poor experience attempting to get a bike rental. I can only assume based on this that maybe they don't upkeep the equipment well enough. Okay, so bad first impression, but once i finally got a bike, it obviously worked fine as a bike should. No flats, no issues, no problems.However, the second time I rented a bike, it was for a ""24 hour"" period of time, quoted at ""$8"" for the entire period. Now comes the fun part... a few days later i was charged an additional $94!!Apparently, you are supposed to dock the bike every 30 minutes or else you will be charged outrageous amounts for the time (that you supposedly already paid for). This is not disclosed in an obvious location or anywhere in the prompting on the tiny screen in front of you. This is only noted in the extremely long and arduous to read ""Terms & Conditions"" (which by the way is about 156 pages or so, and would take hours to read on the tiny screen provided for you)I immediately called Capital Bikeshare to dispute this charge and see if they would give me a one time waive, considering I did not damage the bike and followed what I had believed were the appropriate procedures. I spoke with 1 lady, Lawanda, who was a smart-alec and not helpful... She was only offering a 50% reduction of my fee and was trying to help get management (UNACCEPTABLE). Unfortunately I had to hang-up for another call coming in. I then had to call back and spoke with Brandy, who could not get her phone off of speaker or was having some kind of feedback loop issue with the audio. That may not have been her fault, but regardless, not helping my frustrations. At this point I am incredibly fed up and disgusted with this company. I have read other reviews online dealing with similar situations I had only realized after the fact.In summary, I am livid with these people and the company and hope I can get this charge waived. I will have only horrible things to say/share and will deter people from using this service if the topic comes up in conversation.  Hopefully management can reach out and help to fix my perception."

DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/13/2018,Hell yeah!! Now that they lowered the prices down to $2 the rides are getting more awesome than assome! I'm really loving my bicycle ride shares since August 2nd 2018.

I'm extremely happy about my met fitness goals from Capital Bikeshare which allowed me to bike each week after week with resolving other bike costs to within the means.

DC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/31/2017,"Total scam, don't waste your money . . .After months of walking past 2 bikeshare  stations connecting my Adams Morgan home to the Woodley Park Metro, I decided to purchase a membership and, in so doing, trade my 10-min walk for a 3-min bike ride. Big mistake.I purchased a 1-year membership, allowing unlimited 30-minute rides. Initially, I was happy with the service, using it primarily for traveling to the Metro (a 4-block, 3-min trip) on workdays. As I got used to the service, I began using it for trips to my gf's condo on the West End (a 2.5 mile, 20-min trip) on days when I didn't want to drive. But recently I came face-to-face with the unfair billing practices that other reviewers have complained about.  A recent review of my credit card statement revealed that I was charged $110 (an amount that is even more than I had paid for the year-long membership) for two trips--one to Woodley Park Metro and one to the West End. When I called to find out why I had been charged so much, I was accused of having had the bike in my possession for several hours (4 hours for one trip and 7 hours for the other). When I denied having ever spent more than 20 minutes on any single trip, the customer service rep suggested there was nothing she could do.Because all records of how long you've kept a bike on any given trip are maintained internally, there is really no way to disprove the company's claims or dispute excessive charges. The service can charge whatever they want at any given time and put you in the impossible position of proving a negative--that you didn't have a bike for as long as they claim you have. Rather than continue with the service, I've simply filed a dispute with my CC, canceled my membership (with 6 months remaining) and moved on. There are some companies whose business model is predicated on defrauding customers, paying back customers when forced, and holding on to the profits from those who either don't notice the fraud or choose to avoid the hassle of challenging. This appears to be such a company. This has the potential to be a decent service, but not as it currently operates. If you want a bike, just buy your own. This company is to be avoided at all costs.***If you currently use this service, make sure you are checking your credit card statements each month. They don't contact customers when excess charges are applied and simply charge the credit card that is used to secure the membership.***"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/08/2018,"On a quick weekend trip to D.C. my husband and I parked at a metro-station and took the metro into D.C. on a Friday where we walked and saw the sites, we spent the night at Hamilton hotel and spend the following Saturday in D.C. then left around 4pm. We purchased a 24 hour pass at 5pm on Friday and used the bikes three times. Once to ride around the Tidal Basin and to our Hotel, once to Union Station to grab some food and see the place and then again to the Museum of the Bible. All of which had amazingly close and convenient parking docks. The seats where uncomfortable for me and the bike was a tad too tall even on the shortest seat setting which I feel played a factor in the extreme discomfort. However, I highly recommend using this service due to its cheap price, convenience and copious docking locations. Taking a bike ride around the Tidal Basin was probably my favorite part of the entire trip highly recommend!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,11/30/2017,"I really love Capital Bikeshare.  When using it as intended, for short trips it is inexpensive and very easy to use.  I use it for occasional one way trips on my evening commute either all the way home from my office (~4 miles) or from the metro to home.  I have an annual membership, which at this point has paid for itself both in time saved and what I would have spent on metro/bus.  The bikes are heavy, slow, wobbly, and sometimes they are broken.   Don't expect them to be as nice as your personal bike, they are not exactly great for riding down Mt Vernon trail but on streets they are good.  I've ended up with a few that had mechanical issues and swapping them out for repair is easy enough.  I like the storage on the front and the lights are helpful.  If you want to cut out WMATA for all or part of your commute once in a while try the bikeshare.   You won't enjoy trying to bike from the mall to mount vernon or ride around downtown for 4 hours."

There are way better options and many companies doing it better. Ford Go, LimeBike, Spin, etc. I generally like the kiosk system because you don't have to spend time hunting them down if you need more than one, but this price gouging for something that is otherwise so good for earth friendly transportation is an insult."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/15/2018,"My daughter And I had a morning to wander DC before we had to return home, so we thought it would be fun to ride bikes to the Capital Building.  We picked up our bikes at one of the Kiosks, rode to our destination and returned in about an hour. We put the bikes in the dock, I quickly received a text saying we had been successful and we left, happy for our time in DC. Then, hours later while I am in the security line at the airport, I received a second text saying that a bike had not been returned and I was incurring charges. I called the number provided and was told I needed to return to the kiosk and re-dock the bike. Clearly, returning was not a possibility, and I explained that both bikes were returned together, that I had made a single reservation for two bikes, and had received a message saying we had successfully returned. I did realize after I called that the text message said a particular bike # had been returned but I assumed this was a reservation number for both bikes. The customer service rep. said since I couldn't return to re-dock  the bike, somebody from the company would have to go do it..... in approximately three hours... and I would incur charges of $8/30min until the bike had been re-docked. RIDICULOUS! When I asked to speak to a manager, I was told I could call back and try to speak with a different representative but they were following company policy and I would only hear the same from anyone I spoke with. This has been the WORST customer service experience I have had in a very, very long time. I would absolutely dissuade anyone from using Capital Bikeshare. There are many better ways to get around DC; walking comes to mind."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/12/2018,"Not worth the hassle!you have many better choices, Spin and Lime to name a few!Finding a dock is a hassle then docking is another.  Then it may not dock properly, in all these cases you will pay through your nose, so beware!Seems like they are mainly concerned with milking all their users on overages and other charges.  They should be kicked out of DC and NYC!many better companies to choose from the city should know better!Ciao,"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/07/2018,"Dont use. First time user. If someone steals a parked bike right in front of you, you still get charged $1200. What a scam. Why dont yall invest in your company and put gps on your product so your customers arent held ransom for the decision of some jackass."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/11/2018,My husband and I rented bikes when we were in DC over Memorial Weekend. We thought it would be fun and an easy way to get around. I had never rented bikes before so I looked through the options and I picked what I believed to be the $8 24hour pass after reading the options.  I just saw the charge on my bill. $16 for the the pass AND another $94.00. I am so livid right now. The pricing is INSANELY MISLEADING. NEVER AGAIN! $110 to rent bikes. Con artists.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/06/2018,Horrible!  What a joke in how to run a business.  First off we rented out bikes at night.  The touch screen said 8$ a day.  Fair enough.  I didn't know till afterwards you have to dock your bike every 30 minutes to negate late fees.  What??? My buddy who took his bike back to the hotel room overnight was charged 95$.  He called the business and got it reduced to 55$.  Thumbs down.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/19/2017,"Charged $94 for an hour bike ride. Happened to catch the overage on my credit card statement. Called customer no service and they said I was at fault, no refund. No chance to dispute this with management at all. They just gave me an email address and a nice stiff arm. I just ended up filing a dispute on my credit card so will wait and see. Seems to me a bike monopoly used to get money out of unsuspecting tourists for fines. Wonder how they wrote up the business plan for that one."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/07/2017,"Had an issue where my bike didn't register as returned. The girl I called and spoke to told me there was nothing she could do unless I can verbally tell her the bike is in the dock. I had to go all the way back to the dock and just say it was there. Then magically her supervisor lifted the late fees....  needless to say I'm pretty pissed offAlso incase you didn't know the thief's at bike share with only charge 2.00 for 30 mins, but once your ""late"" they charge an additional 30.00.... F*ck that. Never again"
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/28/2017,"Bikeshare is a great idea, but the actual bikes suck. They are heavy, unwieldy, slow and unsafe. I bike to work (on my own road bike) everyday, but last week had to rent a Bikeshare while mine was in the shop. The front steering column is so heavy and clunky that you have to use a lot of arm strength to hold it steady when starting, stopping, or turning. Its center of gravity is off, so if you're not careful you could fall over while turning and the heavy-ass bike will crush your legs and you will eat the pavement.The worst part is how slow they are. If I ever end up behind them in a bike lane, I watch out for the first opportunity to pass them because hey, I ain't got all day. Also most of the people riding them are inconsiderate and rude bikers who have no regard for traffic laws. Capital Bikeshare needs to replace their outdated fleet of shitty bikes, fix their bike machine panels where you rent them out, lower the cost from $8/day (what if I just want to do one 20 minute ride? I'd rather just take a taxi and pay $6) and do some rider education about basic traffic laws. (Don't bike on the sidewalk, signal when turning, don't bike next to your boyfriend at .0000001 MPH while hogging an entire bike lane because you're oohhhh so cute.)I see a lot of white entitlement on these bikes."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/14/2017,"BE VERY CAREFUL WITH DAY PASSES. Their website says it's $8 for a 24 hour pass. They have an odd definition of 24 hours. This only allows you to use the bike in 30 minute increments--returning it each time to a station. I made the mistake of taking two visitors on a tour of DC for an afternoon and got stuck with a $140 bill instead of $16. Their customer service people were not understanding and not able to waive any of this. If the 24-hour price listed on their site simply mentioned ""30-minute increments"" below it, I would have explored the details. While I understand their program now (with a much lighter wallet), it's not consistent with the common expectation of ""24-hour pass."" I really feel ripped off and will be hesitant to use them again or recommend them. If you are a regular member, it works well."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/25/2018,"Understand the fee structure first!! Wish I had read the other reviews before we checked out our bikes. My husband and I got them through the app during a fun trip to DC. We bought the 24 hr pass so we could ride around the National Mall. It was a ton of fun and we loved being able to see everything for the almost 3 hrs we had the bikes. But then we got home and saw that they had charged us $16 for the 24 hr pass (which we expected) and then another $60!!! When I went to see why we had been charged so much, there it was, on a hidden page that is hard to find. The fee structure says they can charge crazy amounts of money if you go over the 30 minute time limit but this isn't clear at all in the ""24 hour pass"" option. They purposely make it deceiving so that people have to pay more and it's really dishonest. I'm sad that what was a positive memory is now shaded by this frustrating experience. We definitely wouldn't have paid $76 for 3 hours on a bike had we known."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/20/2018,Sucks. Bikes are usually in terrible shape. The 30 min rule is ridiculous.  The app will tell you no bikes at a station and you walk up and there is 3. ZERO customer service if you try and call them.  Love the concept but this company is a fail!
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/12/2017,"BEWARE: When renting bikes of the fine print they hide that you have to return the bike every 30 min or you get charged an addition $30 per bike. This is a scam to get more money as it's hidden in the fine print. When I called to complain, they just fell back on I should have paid more attention to the contract. Shame on me for not reading all 133 pages of fine print on the little 4 inch screen."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/05/2017,Like most other reviewers on here I was unaware that there were any usage fees for over 30 minutes even when you purchase a day pass. It is not clearly advertised at stations that these fees exist. We paid $16 for 2 day passes and were charged an additional $44 in fees. This should be clearly advertised at all bike stations. It's not really worth it to have to go find a bike dock every 30 minutes because you'll probably spend half the time looking for the nearest station/figuring out how to dock the bike/accessing a new code.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/09/2018,"When something goes wrong the mask slips. I docked my bike correctly. They email and hour later to say I have not docked the bike correctly. I get that email 8 hours later and 3 miles from the dock. I call, they don't deviate from the Visio flow chart. Computer says no. You failed. You owe us. You owe us $150 in lost revenue and if the bike is lost up to the cost of the bike. It's is on you the customer to make this right they make clear. Go back and check. Or request a rep to go check. I ask if that is by request only then how much will it cost? They are deliberately vague. I walk 3 miles back to the dock. 8 hours after the event. The bike is docked like I said it was.Thank you for telling us they say we will send a rep out however until that happens you are on the hook for the costs. Why? Because computer says no. The Visio flowchart doesn't allow for the customer to be right or the contractor to be proactive. The customer must ask us to be helpful."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/06/2018,"This is the best way to get around DC; instead of UBER all the time and Metro. Exercise is important and this is alternative way to see the city very easy. I recommend the 3 days pass for $18. You are able to ride the bike for 30 minutes, unlimited times. The down fall is you can only ride a max of 30 min at a time but to us that was not a problem b/c we knew where we were going. Now you can take the bike out and reload and take it out again with out any problem.. great way to get around.. loved it!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/10/2017,"Capital Bike Share? More like Communism Bike Share.Pay attention to the usage charges Best to get the $8 24hr option, even though it's not 24hrs, more like 24 hours 30 min at a time, since they will charge $8 per 30 min regardless of what you do and it will leave you with a hefty bill. The  8 hour is a ripoff since it is not 24hr you have to dock every 30 min, no warnings on if you are coming up on 30 min, only a text after about 2 hours that you went over, by that time they made their money on you, and it takes a half hour just to find an open dock!  All a money making scheme targeting tourist. Boycott Capital Bike Share!!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/04/2016,Looking forward to renting a bike from this brand new bike rental location when they finally manage to install the 15 bikes. Capital Bikeshare chose a good location for this station but they could have have installed it next to the W & OD trail instead.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/23/2017,"Usage FeesTrips under 30 minutes are included in the pass price. If you keep a bike out for 30 minutes or longer at a time, usage fees apply.RIDE LENGTH USAGE FEE*0-29 minutes Included30-59 minutes $260-89 minutes + $490+ minutes + $8 per each additional 30 minutesThe above is copied from the Capital Bikeshare website.Want to rent a bike for 4 hours? - $8 + $2 + $4 + $40 = $54Four of us rented bikes for a tour of the mall and monuments last weekend.  At the kiosk it implies/states that the cost for a 24hr. rental is $8.  Perhaps buried somewhere else are the usage fees.  We were charged $280 for four bikes for the afternoon.Seems like a great way to fleece tourists and leave a lasting impression.1st kiosk had one bike so we tried to rent it but it was broken (if the light blinks yellow and then red after entering the code then the bike cannot be rented).  So we headed to the next station to find bikes.  What we didn't know is that the code expires in 5 mins.  Tried to use the same code at the next station.  No work. When you enter an expired code the dock light blinks yellow then red as if the dock/bike is broken and cannot be rented.  Because the next two stations only had one bike each and each time the light blinked red we figured these single bikes/docks were broken as well.  Off to the third station with plenty of bikes.  Kiosk is not accepting credit cards.  Off to 4th station.  Finally got our bikes and we're on our way.  Little did we know the meter was running."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/04/2017,"We were in town for a 3-day conference last week and knew we had to cram as much fun as possible to make it an awesome trip.  We decided that the Capitol Bikeshare program could help us maneuver town quickly and inexpensively.  A 3-day pass is $17 - perfect!First, READ all of the bits of info on the kiosk. Bikes are checked out in 30-minute increments, and you'll be billed for periods longer than 30 minutes. Returning bikes is as simple as slipping them into a station and ensuring the status light turns green. Sometimes it takes some muscle to get the green light, so don't be shy.Second, plan each trip. We used Google Maps with the bike route function to choose roads that were bike-friendly, and coupled it with the Capitol Bike share map to be sure there was a nearby station with available slots to return our bikes. The map shows how many bikes are at each station, too, so you can be relatively confident that a bike will be waiting for you when you're ready for your next bike. Did it take a few minutes to plan it out? Yep. But we saved SO much time by not walking. Put your phone in your workout arm band and affix the armband to the cord that secures your items in the basket for easy reference.  Third,  these bikes are not your road or fitness hybrid bikes. They're HEAVY. The tires are fat. And the saddle would make Grandma happy. It takes a beat to adapt to the geometry, but these bikes are meant to withstand potholes and anything else that can get in your way.  You have three gears on the right handlebar. Twist the ring to the right of the handlebar to find the appropriate gear. Bells are on the left handlebar. Make noise so cabbies and tour buses stand a chance of hearing you.Fourth, be sure to adjust the seat so you're getting a good, comfy ride. Fifth, bring your helmet - I wish I would have thought to bring mine!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/17/2017,"Metro can be unreliable and its stations too sparse sometimes. Traffic is too horrible for car or rideshare especially near the Mall. Walking is sometimes not a realistic option between two points.The perfect solution? Biking! But not everyone especially visitors has a bike, so Capital Bikeshare solves that problem!This bike-sharing program is seriously the best innovation I've seen in DC! Years ago when I first got to DC, getting around was a hassle, but with Capital Bikeshare, I could explore more on bike during my 2nd time back in DC. With so many bike docks throughout the city, it's usually not a problem finding an available bike unless you are around super-popular point like Lincoln Memorial.If you have at least a day pass, you can use the bike as many times as you want without extra charge as long as you ride for less than 30 minutes each time. Just make sure if you dock your bike properly (wait for the light to turn green) after you're done or else you'll be charged after 30 minutes! Use the Metro or rideshare to cover the extreme distances, but if you are traversing medium to short distance especially throughout the National Mall, I highly recommend using Capital Bikeshare!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,02/14/2018,"I have been a customer for 3 years paying for the yearly option. I found out I was moving to another state soon and emailed to inquire about canceling. Rather than telling me what the policy was, they immediately charged me 64$ (the amount for the rest of the year) and canceled my plan. When I asked them to restart it as I was not moving for two more months and I did not know I would be immediately charged, they said sorry no can do.For being a customer for so long I didn't deserve to be treated like this. With so many other bike share options you would think they would be more willing to work with their customers."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/30/2018,"Worst mistake of renting a bike. We were exhausted from walking and in a sketchy part of town at night, trying to quickly access a bike and didn't realize what we agreed to. We rode to the Lincoln memorial, parked, walked 5 steps away and took a picture and someone rode off on our bikes. On the scooters (that we used all day but we're dead at this time) they had GPS's and you can end your ride immediately if someone takes off on it. We didn't realize the bikes weren't like that (first time using it) and were devastated when they were gone, and read the ""you're responsible for up to $1200 if bike is not returned"" part. Called customer service immediately and the nice lady reassured me if whoever stole them returned them, she would waive the fee. Well, the man I talked to today said he would not be able to do that and was super rude and said ""well I could get my manager to review it but we don't normally waive fees.. but like at least they returned the bike""... yes we're SUPER grateful they returned the bikes... but it was 14hrs later (supposed to turn them in every 30min) so we were charged $94 each for a BIKE that we rode for maybe 20 minutes because we ""abandoned it""... at the time I was frustrated because he was making it seem like I was lying to him about the lady saying she would waive the fee, so I said forget it because he was SO rude. It was a good 20 minutes while it lasted but if you're in DC don't you dare get off that bike at ALL for anything at all or you'll be charged out the butt for a bike that isn't even worth that much money. Rent a scooter, it's cheaper in the long run and has a GPS. The lady in customer service was awesome, but the man who I spoke to today should not be in customer service at all. Such a shame because we enjoyed the bikes but we will not touch one again due to this awful experience."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,02/22/2017,"On Feb 21 at 2:45 pm, I picked up a bicycle in front of my building at 455 Mass Ave and peddled to Metro Center next to Macy's, where I intended to drop-off the bicycle at the Capital Bikeshare bicycle stand and take the Orange line. Unfortunately, there was no empty places to drop-off the bicycle so I drove to the other Capital Bikeshare across the street--no empty places there. So I drove to the Smithsonian Metro where there are two Capital Bikeshare bicycle stands; unfortunately, no place to drop-off my bicycle. I called Capital Bikeshare to explain my problem--I was told to go to Jefferson and 14th street where there are three empty spots. People...Jefferson and 14th street?! There's no metro station there and I'm wanting to get home: the time was now 3:30. I decided that the easiest solution was to drive back to Chinatown where I know there's a bicycle rack and try to get the Red Line--unfortunately, no empty places to drop-off my bicycle either. At 3:45 I found a place to drop-off the bicycle in front of the MLK library. Read the other comments and you will connect the dots and realize that Capital Bikeshare deliberately keep the bicycle racks filled necessitating the user to driver around town looking for an empty rack and paying overtime for the use of the bicycle. Great job Capital Bikeshare!"
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,12/22/2017,"The bikes are serviceable, but often times I would arrive at the Union Station rack and it would be totally full.  This causes many issues for me because I have to catch a very specific train out of DC and I have missed that train on a few occasions due to the bike rack being full.  There should be more oversight of that location due to its importance.  I'm afraid if this continues I will be forced to discontinue my account and find alternate means of transportation within DC."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,03/17/2016,"I've always been hesitant to purchase a bike because: 1) They get stolen in DC all the time, even if you have a decent lock; and 2) I'm too lazy to find one that fits my 4'11'' frame, apart from the occasional Craigslist search. Thus, I've renewed my Capital Bikeshare membership for the past three years because walking long distances gets boring and because the metro is a pain in the butt. Plus, there's something about riding home with the wind in your hair and your purse repeatedly smacking against your side that really makes you feel alive. Is an annual membership worth it? Only if you ride it at least 34 times per year, as this would approximate the amount of metro money you'd save by opting to bike instead ($85 membership divided by $2.50 for an average metro ride). As someone who rides to and from work/bars/gym etc., it's more than worth it. BTW, it's cool to see on your online account how many rides you've taken, where you've taken them, and the mileage. #memories #nostalgiaHowever, Capital Bikeshare's imbalanced bike distribution is the BANE OF MY EXISTENCE. On most days, there are zero bikes available around 9am at the two stations closest to me in the Shaw/Mt. Vernon area, so I have to walk to work instead. Or, there will seem to be a bike available to my utter delight, only for me to discover that it's actually out of service. When I emailed customer service about this, they pleasantly stated that the ""team of Station Rebalancers is working hard to augment the circulation of bikes."" Well, work harder? The station at V and 14th NW is another repeat offender with no docks available much of the time, forcing me to open my Spotcycle app and anxiously look for new stations before I get charged for having a bike for over 30 minutes. The uncertainty of being able to either find a bike or find an open dock when you need it is prompting me to think more deeply about buying my own bike. I wish it weren't a problem because Capital Bikeshare has otherwise been really fun to use - and I don't even mind their clunkiness (c'mon, we're not exactly riding rugged trails over here, so I don't exactly get the complaints about their bulky structure)."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/18/2017,"I've been using this service for almost two years and it seems like a great idea (hence the 2nd star). However, the idea isnt the problem. The company or the people representing it are a fantastic failure. First, the maintenance on the bikes is sub par. You may get a broken bike, you may find a dock that doesn't release any bikes, and sometimes docking your bike doesnt end your trip. On multiple occasions, the docking has shown a green light (success) and then I get an email stating that the bike I've docked is still in use. Once, I had to call and find out myself, as there was no notice. But there is a charge, and IF you call and IF they send someone to check, and IF they notice a problem then they will refund your money. So, my advice is to take a picture of the green light at every dock. (What a pain!).I had a technician watch me take the picture once during a lunch break and asked if there was a problem. I told him why I do that and he smirked and then removed all the bikes from that dock (even the one I just docked and planned to ride back). I then had to walk back.I know customer service in this city is crap, but even the adults at this company seem to get there cues from how an apathetic teenager would do their job. This may be my last subscription to this ""service"". The idea of spending way too much on a bike to have it possibly stolen or vandalized is starting to seem like a better value than Capital Bikeshare."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,02/16/2017,"Easy to use, automated, communal bike sharing service gets five stars all the way!It couldn't be any easier: purchase a membership for $8, first half-hour of bike use is included, then it's $2 for the next half hour, then $6 for every half hour after that, with a maximum lease time of 24 hours per lease.From the moment you walk up to the self-service machine in between the racks of bicycles, the process is very easy to navigate.  Simply select how many bicycles you'd like, how you'd like to pay, then process payment, unlock your bicycle with the code on the receipt, tour, and return.  The best part of it all is that you can return a bicycle to any station with available storage around the city.  I only wish we had one of these in smaller cities, like Reno, Nevada!The only area for critique with these is that the bikes we borrowed had tires that were starting to bald in the center.  I'm not sure who services these or how often they are checked, but it was about time for a new tire on both the bikes my friend and I borrowed.  Unfortunately, these are so popular that there were only three left (out of 20) available and we didn't have much of a selection to choose from.  Other than the balding tire issue, the rest of the bicycle was in great repair!Overall, a great experience with a communal bike sharing program that easily pulls five stars!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/10/2017,"Be very wary of this company.  We thought that it would be a great idea to explore the city on bikes until we checked our bank account.  They lead you to believe that you are renting a bike for $8/day; however, they charge you additional fees if you keep the bike for longer increments of time than 30 minutes.  Two phone representatives confirmed receiving multiple complaints from customers about additional unknown charges but state that they are only able to authorize the return of a portion of the fees charged to my card.  If you ask me, use Uber."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/03/2017,"This company is misleading. I loved the idea of renting bikes in the city until I saw my bank statement. I own a bike but thought it would be fun to rent one and explore. I picked the 24 hour bike rental several times. What I didn't know is that they will charge you every 30 min if you don't return the bike. You have to return every 30 min at the bus rental station and then enter your code again to take the bike back out.No one has time to read the 100 page outline and half the time the screens don't work properly. Misleading and very inconvenient. There are bike trails that don't have stations close by. This will be the last time I rent one through them. I suggest you invest in your own bike, it's cheaper."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/07/2016,"Completely unfair billing setup. Had to cancel my membership due to being relocated. Because i was ""outside of the 30 day renewal period"" i was charged for an entire year of service that i will never be able to use! Also, never knew that i was set to automatically renew once my initial term was over and had i known i would've opted out. This should be more clear along with your cancellation policies.  In such a transient city such as DC, how can you expect people to pay for a year when they are relocated? In addition, both bikes and docks are never there when you need them or the docks go for long periods of time without being fixed. Not a yelp reviewer typically but couldn't hold my tongue on this one. SCAM!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/17/2016,"What a scam!!!! Last Saturday I rented a capital bikeshare bike with the 24 hours hold ($8) to don't worry about 30 minutes return policy, even when I only needed the bike for two hours maximum. When I was ready to return it, three stations were completely full and I had to wait for 30 minutes to return the bike. I called the office to let them know that someone should come and pick up some bikes from several locations in Georgetown since there were like 15 people waiting to return the bikes, but of course no one picked up.Today Monday, I checked my bank account and I was charged another $14 on top of the $8. When I called to inquired about this charge, a very annoyed customer service agent (Ashley) told me that I need to return the bike every 30 minutes regardless of the 24-hours rental or I will get charge. Absolute false advertisement and the worst customer service. Will never rent a bike from  them again and I hope that you do the same."

This is not a great option for tourist because you are not aware of the area so it will be a challenge for you to find a bike station to return the bike before extra fees. If you are having ANY issues with charges, don't expect customer service to make the right call. I am very disappointed, as I have used the bikeshare many many times, and unfortunately this will be my last.I wanted to inform others so they don't lose out on anymoney"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/16/2016,"Don't do it! They are not effective at balancing where the bike stations are full, so you end up near your destination with no way to turn in your bike. We rented as a scenic way to ride to the Mall near the Holocaust Museum. It was a hot summer day and when we got there we couldn't get rid of our bikes.  So we went to the next closest.  Full. It's a bad feeling when you have to drop your bike and take a taxi back to your destination.        Also, the web page map is impossible to navigate on an iphone.  It was useless for finding bike stations.         There are technology solutions to these issues and Capital Bike share should invest in them."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/01/2018,"What they don't tell you on their website or without making you scroll through LITERALLY 67 screens on a freaking kiosk is that if you don't redock every 30 minutes, they charge you ""overages"". My niece and I paid for a 24 hour membership on bikes and used 45 minutes. We were charged $16 together and while pricey, it was fair for 24 hours. However, a few days later I saw a charge for $4.00 on my account. I called my bank first and disputed it then I called them. They explained that it was because they are a ""bikeshare"" and are used for short trips. Now, the station was so full of bikes when we returned that we literally had to wait for someone to rent a bike so that we could redock ours. This is ridiculous because it's not written in plain English anywhere that you can easily access or. It's buried in 67 screens on a kiosk (who's going to read that?) and doesn't appear anywhere on their site. I looked very thoroughly. It's a rip off to say the least, but if you want to rent a bike to sightsee, keep in mind where the stations are and be sure to redock every 30 mins!!!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/12/2016,"Avoid using Capital Bikeshare if you plan to take a ride longer than 30 minutes. I was visiting DC for the first time and wanted to visit the some different spots (White House, Embassies, National Mall, etc). I figured the 24 hour pass for 8 dollars would be the safest bet instead of paying hourly, but man did I get screwed. I saw a 54 dollar charge on my account and called their customer service number. I am told I have to check the bike in every 30 minutes otherwise more usage fees get charged to my transactions. I had the bike between 4-5 hours so the fees added up. Of course no one is going to read the 130 page user agreement on a kiosk in the sun when you can hardly read the screen.24 hour access as long as you dock it every 30 minutes.. The kiosk doesnt give any emphasis about this. Know what you're getting yourself into.  I understand how its helpful for residents, but I find it distasteful how easy it is for this company to scam tourists."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/19/2016,"AVOID AT ALL COST IF YOU VALUE YOUR BENJAMINS!  CBS charged me $30 on top of the $2 membership fee after I took a trip from the White House to 22nd & P. They claimed that I took a 3 hour bike trip.Why would I take 3 hour bike trip in a business suit/in the middle of summer/with humidity/during rush hour? What do you think I'm f* insane?? From the White House to 22nd & P is a 11 minute trip MAX. I tried to reconcile this mistake with their customer service department and even sent them a picture of my receipt. I always get my receipt after I return a CBS bike. CBS responded ""because you're a first time user ... We will credit you $15."" Well, CBS...(1) I'm not a first time user. I use the bikes all the time. But, now I won't any more! (2) I don't want your charity. Give me my money! They haven't responded. So, I decided to report this as fraud to my credit card.

DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/27/2016,"The locations of the bike stations are good and it's a good concept, but DO NOT sign up long-term. You're supposed to get the key within 7 days of signing up, but it's been 16 days now, and I still don't have a key. Plus, the touch-screen at the bike stations doesn't work half the time, and the kiosk didn't recognise my credit card. So after paying for a 30 day membership, I haven't been able to use it, and it's already 16 days in. Local management has said they have no explanation and can't do anything. The concept is great, execution is terrible. Bikeshare works in so many other cities, I don't know why the DC centre has to be so terrible at this."

The options they give you sort of force you to buy he 24 pass, assuming this will be cheaper. That is not the case. 2 -24 hour passes cost $16 with the first 30 minutes supposedly free. They have a small gray and black pixel screen reminiscent to a 90's game boy, which is difficult to read on their small screen in the blaring sunlight. We rode around for 3 hours, no problem. Docked the bikes back when we were ready to go. 2 days later we see 2 separate charges- one for the $16, and one for $76. Imagine my confusion! When called they said, and I quote, ""The bikes are supposed to be docked every 30 minutes and are not really for tourist use."" Well why put them in high tourist areas? Why not explicitly state that they need to be docked every 30 minutes? Why hide your hidden fees within 133 pages of terms and conditions on a screen smaller then my phone? They were not willing to do a refund of any kind, poor customer service Being from out of town this put a huge hold on my trip and the people I had accompanied with me. Save your money.

I think going to a bike rental place would have been better if youre short so you can choose the right size bikeFinding dock stations was a pain. Then when you find a docking station and there isnt room to dock your bike you need to look for another dock station which is super inconvenient. Downloading the app works but you have to keep checking it and sometimes even though it says there are 2 bikes available or two open docks available it is wrong because the sensor is broken. Happened only once but it was really inconvenient. Next time i will rent a bike for the size factor and the convenience of being able to lock it next to a post near by my destination."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/20/2017,"WARNING - D.C. Tourist Trap....  unless you dock the bike EVERY 30 minutes, which is pretty much impossible, you will be charged $22 additional dollars over and above the Day Pass of $8. Better to ride Uber. It will cost you less. I used the bike for 3 hours."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,07/08/2016,"I think many new people don't understand how the bike share thing works. My wife and myself found this out while we were in Colorado one year. We thought we could keep the bike for 24 hours but luckily we returned the bike. I found out later that you need to return the bikes within 30 mins so as to not get charged. These bikes are the same way. I just understand that customer services is probably problematic.  I would hope that customer service improves but you get what you pay for and these people probably don't get paid much to hear our daily problems.So keep this in mind when using these bikes:1. You need to buy an ""access key"" which can range from 1 to 3 days access. It's like a virtual key (the machine will give u a code).2. Have your payment method (credit card) with you whenever you need to get a bike. If you have a 3-day ""virtual access key"" I think you might need it to get a new code each time you access the bike. The codes are only good for a limited amount of time (which is good if you lose the code or drop it, no one else can use it).3. Map out where you're going so you can plan to return your bike within 30 minutes. There are hundreds of the bike share stalls around DC area. Look for one that's on your way to wherever you're planning to go.4. A way to get around having to pay the hourly fee is to plan your trip so you can hit a biking stall before you get to a monument, return your bike (babysit the bike), and then immediately have your significant other get a new access code and ride off (it starts the 30-min cycle all over again). Just make sure the bike is fully secure when you return the bike like this. * whenever we returned the bike we always made sure the bike was firmly secured and returned. Give it a couple of hard pulls to double check the bikes locked-in because the system doesn't really give you a receipt of return.  I would hate for someone to steal your bike with no proof of return."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/29/2015,"As a daily Capital Bikeshare user, commuting to my job on a bike happily, you would expect me to be more generous with my stars.  But my happy has more to do with biking itself than with the merits of Capital Bikeshare. Yes, I love communing with nature and the open sky, not being subject to the consistently breaking down and overcrowded DC metro system or unpredictable road traffic. I love riding one-way with the option of returning using another mode of transportation-- for example in case of thunderstorms, plain-old sick DC humidity, or other weather issues. I also like not having to worry about maintenance-- no more late mornings because I had to pump my tires at the last minute!  Yet, Capital Bikeshare sure is a drag.  My main issue is not with the tank-like bikes (three gears only and heavy, but functional) but with the system.The Bikeshare system was bought second hand from a Canadian city. Yes, the capital of the most powerful nation in the world could not actually pull together a modern system designed just for it. That's why the kiosks at the bike stands seem like IBM DOS-based machines from the 80s, you know black and white with blinking text. If you happen to hit sun glare on the screen, good luck figuring out what it says.  The kiosks often become a problem because the touch-sensitive function is antiquated.  If you want to return a bike when the racks are full, you have to navigate the screen to get the free extra 15 minutes of loan. This system requires you to punch in a keycode from your membership key...no easy feat given the touch screen; it functions poorly and seems like its on a delay. In an age where you can use a smartcard even on DC's old metro system and swipe entry badges against sensors everywhere, this is an unpleasant experience.I question the convenience of these loaner bikes at crunch time, when I intend to dock a bike and make an appointment, but the bikestands are full. This happens fairly regularly to me, be warned.  So you have to build in extra time to ride to the next available open bike stand...and navigate the aforementioned kiosk screens.Frequently I have had to call in (and have observed others doing the same) because of problems and not being able to use the kiosks to address an issue. It takes a good 15-20 minutes of explanation with the robotic customer service people, in loud traffic when you can barely hear....and it does lead you to wonder if you could have saved time by using metro...(likely yes!)The pricing system would be incredibly intimidating to me if I didn't have the annual membership.  It's a $100 deposit, and then a tiered system of charges based on how long you keep a bike.  Gazonkers! Their computer system is often not synched up with the bike stands.  So the kiosk may tell you there are three open slots, but actually those stands themselves may be broken and incapable of securely locking a bike.  Maintenance is pretty good but when the system is old anyway, you have more incidents of improperly-working bike parking stands (not the bikes themselves).Beware the stands themselves may appear to lock the bike but they actually don't.  Often you hear the whirring noise of a motor and walk off assuming the locks work when it may not...and you'll find out later when you get your credit card statement. Just wait till you see the green light before walking away, even if you are distracted and in a hurry.The SPOTCYCLE app for smartphones seems to work great, and helps with finding bikes.In general I am glad we have a Bikeshare system. I just think the system infrastructure is tedious, and desperately needs to be upgraded."

DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/26/2017,"This is the best way to see all the sites in DC. Plenty of bikes and stations. Pay attention to the wording though, as many others have mentioned. You get unlimited 30 minute rides but you have to dock the bike before 30 minutes to avoid extra charges. Just dock the bike and remove it right back out to avoid the charges. Overall $8 for 24 hours of use isn't bad at all."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/21/2017,"Very disappointed to see all the one-star reviews, which seem to have been left by people who didn't understand the pricing structure of Bikeshare, which is pretty common anywhere Bikeshare exists. If this is your first time using Bikeshare, here or in another city, please take some time to understand how you will be charged. These bikes are designed to be used for short trips. In DC, you can ""daisy-chain"" short trips together, docking the bike and then taking it out again, to avoid high charges.Capital Bikeshare is one of Washington, D.C.'s gems. I own my own bike, and I'm also an annual member. It's great for getting to appointments in the middle of the day when I don't have my own bike, or when I want to ride one way, but not necessarily the other. The bikes are very stable, and  generally well-maintained, and the companion app (Spotcycle) is super helpful."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/14/2016,I have used bike share for years but lately maintenance of docking stations has really been very poor.

Update:changing my review to one star since I see that Capitol City Bikeshare has not even bothered to respond! For a company that relies on local support this is very disappointing. After using it since their inception I do not think I will be renewing my annual membership when it expires.

But BEWARE: after charging our separate cards the $8 for 24 hours, several of the next stations were not working properly to read my husbands amex card. So really it was worthless and pain. After email to them, they refused to issue any kind of partial refund since we didn't call the phone number when we were having the problems.  Calling is the last thing you want to do in D.C.

Hey I don't like that answer and want someone else to tell me whats up? Wrong, no supervisor for me, they'll just make the poor kid who grabbed me from the queue tell me the supervisor has no balls and can't be bothered to reach out.I'm not an idiot, I was able to read their greyscale pixel screens in the glaring sunshine to understand the pricing structure so I'm not bitching about that, but rather the fact that they double dipped on two of my cards after the machine malfunctioned. Process can not be completed at this time my ass. Sure it's only 16$ at the end of the day but as a local member of Hubway, also owned by the same parent company its more than that.

I also realize that for tourist and D.C. environmentalists bikeshare may be the only way to travel. I often look at these red monstrosities and images of AL Gore and Gisele tooling through the streets of D.C. while Robert Redford chants a mantra for the XL pipeline's demise flash through my mind. Yes, thousands of eager tourist flow to these babies with smiles for miles Well, bully for them, but  for the rest of us, there is a sad reality to all this cycling progress. Yup, this may be how they do it in Amsterdam but the Dutch know how to ride a bike, which is something many American tourist seem to have forgotten. ""Hello, Walking here, Speed Racer."" And if some eager tourist doesn't turn you into a bicycle road pizza, there is the major annoyance of loosing primo parking spaces to Capital Bikeshare's bike stands. Anyone who has ever had to hunt for a spot in Old Town understands just how frustrating it can be to see this biking hoard use eminent domain to claim parking spots that are sorely needed in Old Town. So maybe every time someone rents a bikeshare an environmentalist gets a windmill, but for those  of us who still like to cruise down the road with Detroit steel under our rumps, the bikeshare stands are tantamount to automotive claim-jumping.  ,"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/27/2017,"HORRIBLE customer service. Everything is fine with Cap Bikeshare unless you get a bike or a dock that goes bad. If that happens outside of daylight hours they do not support you the customer at all. If it happens during the day, you're still screwed, because you'll have to wait for a technician to come take the bike from you instead of getting to work or wherever you're in a hurry to get to. Even then, there is no way to stop the rental if the lock is broken, and GET THIS: they don't guarantee they will refund you for the extra time even though it was out of your control. Instead, they send the case up for review/investigation because, after all, you must be doing something wrong.What happened to me: Grabbed the last bike out of Union Station with a very bad sounding lock on a Monday night after a late day at the office. Put it away at a station across from my house with another bad grinding sound, and a red light. I tested the bike and it was stuck in the dock, so I figured the red light meant it was now out of service, and I hurried off to let the dog out before he lost control. Turns out, somewhere in the 130 pages of fine print I'm supposed to have read that the bike releases again after 10 seconds and I'm supposed to call them and.. stay there with it?Got that email a couple hours later as I was climbing into bed, called, and learned that my rental was still running. Completely at their mercy now with a running rental, they pulled me out of bed on a Monday night to go stand in the rain and try over and over again to dock a broken bike.  When it (surprise) didn't work, they wanted me to ride around to another station a half mile away at 11pm in my PJ's, because their policy says that a bike has to be tried at two docks to show that it can't lock. WTH?! At first I thought they were joking.Of course it didn't work there either, and now I'm stuck with a bikeshare bike in my basement until a tech can pick it up (tomorrow).. WITH THE RENTAL STILL RUNNING! Thank God at least I have a place to put it. What would I have done if I were a tourist on my way to the airport with nowhere to put this thing?I was a frequent rider (142 trips in 5 winter months), and I'm sad to say that after tonight, I'm closing my account. What they put me through was utter and total disrespect. They treated and spoke to me like a criminal, abused my time, and disregarded my customer loyalty, all in the name of an idiotic policy."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/10/2016,While there could be room for improvement for novice users this is the best way to cover a lot of ground while touring DC.  Walking the 10 miles we rode would have been a lot harder.  No problem on getting bikes on a July Saturday.  Played the system to keep switching bikes every thirty minutes and all riding was free.  At the commuter store the lady gave us a code for a free 24 hour membership.  The app was helpful to find to docking stations which were close enough to what we needed.  Try it!
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/27/2017,"Just like most things in Washington DC, even the bike system is corrupt. It clearly says $2 for 30 min or $8 per day. We got it for the whole day thinking we wouldn't have to worry with returning it so often. We're charged an extra $38 for not returning it every 30 min. It's so ridiculous. We called and they said that we didn't read the fine print that explained this nonsense."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/08/2016,"We used Bikeshare during a 9 day trip to DC. IT WAS AWESOME!  Bikes were all in great shape, working order, good tires.  Kiosks are placed in excellent distance to distance locations. We only went over on our 30 min ride segment one time due to full bike kiosks during the Folk Life Festival. We still managed to find an empty slot a block away. We found that ample bikes were available and after a few days could strategize the times of day to find bikes or slots available near our apartment and sites. We utilized bike routes and paths and lanes with ease. Drivers were VERY courteous and generous with us on busy crowded streets.  A great experience all around! We recommend it!!!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/10/2017,"We purchased the 24-hour day pass for $8 and we rode for about two hours. We loved our bike ride in the city. However, checked our bank account and they had charged us $92!! Very inconvenient that they hid the fact that you can only ride a bike in 30 minute increments. I am so disappointed with this bike company. It's definitely a scam to try and get more money out of bikers because its hidden so deeply in the fine print. NEVER AGAIN! You'd think after all of the complaints and refunds they would have changed something by now...but no, this company is just dirty."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/05/2017,"Horrible customer service. When bike stations do not work they will offer you a promo code for a free day pass. However, that code will NOT work and they will have no record of your call to customer service and they will plainly call you a liar! Two Thumbs down!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/06/2016,"Excuse me while I gush about Bikeshare. The $85 annual option is a steal. You break even if you replace 49 bus trips with bike trips. I've had my occasional frustrations, but it's excellent overall. I commute to and from work every day with bikeshare. Pro-tip: Phone customer service is awful, but the twitter team is awesome. Also, wear a helmet."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/17/2017,This service has some serious problems and I wouldn't recommend using at all. I've had for a week and already have had two big issues. 1. The app that tells you how many bikes and open slots are at a station isn't always correct. The other day the app said there were a few spots open and when I got there they were all full. I checked the app again and it still said there were spots open when clearly there weren't. How does Capital Bikeshare handle this? You have to go bike to another station until you find an open slot. If you don't you get hit with fees. Horribly inconvenient way to fix their own mistake.2. I tried docking my bike today and the slot wouldn't register it. I tried several other slots at that station and none of them worked. I called customer service (by the way the dialing system makes you repeat everything unnecessarily) and explained the situation and basically got 'there's nothing I can do. Try a different station.' I did that and it still didn't work. Now I'm getting hit with fees while they send out a technician. The customer service rep could not give me an ETA on when the technician would arrive. She said if I left and the bike was stolen than I would get hit with a way bigger fee. Very disappointed with the overall experience and customer service. I guess that's why it's so cheap.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/25/2017,Terrible customer service that scams customers out of money. Good luck trying to get a refund out of the company if somehow the bike doesn't properly register when it's re-docked. They're completely unresponsive and very unhelpful when finally reached on the phone. I will never use Bikeshare again.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/29/2017,"DO NOT USE CAPITAL BIKESHARE-HIDDEN USAGE FEES-SHAM-  I was charged an extra $108 for 2 bikes a  24 Hour Day pass.  The ""24-Hour Rental Pass"" does not in fact mean that you can rent the bike for 24 hours...it actually means you have unlimited 30 minute trips for 24 hours and you have to dock your bike at a station every 30 minutes in order to not be charged EXTRA USAGE FEES. That is a joke of a business model.  They purposely do not make this clear in their branding and instruction wording at all so customers continue to rent the bikes longer than 30 minutes setting you up to fail from the beginning. Customer service is also terrible they blame you for not reading the fine print and not interpreting it correctly and only refer back to the contract on the tiny little screen of the kiosk. They do not refund your money and clearly don't care about keeping you as a return customer."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/25/2017,"I am an avid Biker in DC and my friend visited this weekend and bought a Capital Bikeshare Day Pass. We docked it every 30 minutes like is required and she was charged $94. Apparently although it clicked when she docked it at the end of the day, the light didn't go on. The bike was not damaged or stolen, however it did not register as docked until 11 hours later. When I called customer service they said it didn't matter that it was clearly a mistake and that the best they could do was a 50% refund - charging her $50. I wanted to let everyone know so they can be careful if they have a friend visiting or seek other options like Bike and Roll (haven't used them myself, but will next time).To top it off when I tried calling and asked to speak to a manager for her (she didn't remember where we docked it, etc.) they put me on hold for ten minutes then hung up, and they told my friend she had to accept the 50% and would not allow her to call back. As a big supporter of Bike shares I was extremely disappointed with this awful customer service and hope to see improvements in the future.I'd like to add that I had to speak with Indiego in Philly regarding an incorrect overage charge and they were helpful and friendly, and refunded the charge with no issue. This is not a problem with Bikeshares generally or the 30-min docking rule."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/01/2014,"I'e been visiting DC for the last three years and have always eyed Bikeshare but never used it -- until this last Saturday -- thanks to my son who told me that's what we were going to do.  Turns out I'm glad he was insistent.After figuring our way through the instructions, it was pretty easy.  One one-day membership and two bikes, print out the code to unlock the bikes, adjust the seat and off we went.  The bikes are in excellent condition, three gears, tiny little basket thingie in front. (Too small if you're going shopping.)There's no additional charge for the first 30 minutes.  So we changed bikes as we toured the monuments.  Change 1 at Jefferson Memorial, change 2 at Lincoln, change 3 at 18th & Penn. So far so good.Change 4?  No bikes!!!!  The first stand and every stand we walked by between 17th + Penn and Dupont Circle was empty!!!Change 5. Dupont Circle and then back to the hotel at 21st and Penn.At each stop we took our time. We didn't just shift out the bikes, although you could I suppose.So why four stars and not five?1.  No bikes on mid-afternoon Saturday when we weren't done with our day.2. The bike stations (?) are actually hard to see when you're riding the bike.  You know they're in the area but on which corner or side street? A flag or sign you can see above the parked cars would help.3.  No bikes.I like the way this concept has caught on.  I was in DC four days and saw loads of people riding those red Bike share bikes everywhere I went.  What a great idea."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/30/2017,"Convenient but...deceptive. Be very careful with 24 hour passes! As many of the other reviewers mentioned, the 24-hour pass is essentially a scam. Despite what they say when you try to dispute extra charges, it is not made clear upon purchase that for the 24-hour pass, you must dock and undock a bike every 30 minutes. A three-hour ride using a 24 hour pass ended up costing me $46, as opposed to the $8 advertised. I am the type of person who tends to read all of the fine print, and it is rare that I miss such details. The clause was buried in a ""safety waiver"". The terms for additional fees are not made clear at all, and customer service condescendingly refuses to correct disputed charges. If you opt for a day pass, set a timer for yourself or download the app to make sure that you re-dock after every 30 minutes of riding so you don't get nabbed. What's the point of getting a day pass if with so many restrictions it's not totally a day pass?"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/17/2017,DO NOT USE CAPITAL BIKESHARE.  This company is predatory.  Rent a bike for reasonable fee of $4.00 - return it thinking everything worked properly - then get a $156.00 charge on your credit card in the middle of the night. My group rented 8 bikes and used 3 different credit cards.  We all returned the bikes at the same time to the same location.  I'm confident we all docked them properly.  At midnight I got a notification of a $156 charge on each card.  The company customer service reps have obviously gotten my kind of complaint thousands of times.  They have stock answers explaining how the customer either kept the bike out too long or failed to dock it properly.  They finish by offering a 50% refund.  I think the whole thing is a scam.  It's hard for me to believe that 3 of the people in my group of 8 didn't dock properly.  It's even harder for me to believe that each of those 3 people happened to be on different credit cards.  Add to that the fact that we returned the bikes to a station in a residential neighborhood late in the evening where no one would have found undocked bikes - especially not 3 of them.  The only explanation is that this company makes a lot of money slamming unsuspecting users with this fee.  Even when they offer to refund 50% they're still stealing $78.00 from every person they do this to.  Pretty good racket Bikeshare - your victims are usually tourists who leave and can't fight back.  DO NOT USE CAPITAL BIKESHARE.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/29/2017,"Scam, scam, scam.  If you expect customers to dock every 30 minutes, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to prey upon tourists by leaving a station near the beginning of the monuments tour without any other docks within a reasonable distance nearby."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/25/2017,"We live in DC...my son's bike was broken, so I suggested using Capital Bikeshare because it is close to our house.  What a RIP OFF!!!!!  He got the $8, 24 hour pass.  Little did we know that unless you dock the bike EVERY 30 MINUTES (FREAKING UNREALISTIC/RIDICULOUS), you get slammed with charges.  A few hour ride turned into $78!!!!!!!  What a SCAM!!!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/15/2017,"A lot of people complain about the 30 minute thing but in their defense they post that everywhere when renting a bike that's not the issue. I have a year membership and the real issue is there's never any open bikes in D.C. Proper especially in the Columbia heights area.... With that being said, it is a good company. Every time I call in about an issue their customer service is amazing and my issue is resolved quickly. They have great employees even if there are logistical issues."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/06/2016,"If you live in dc, get a capital bikeshare. It's so little per year that you pretty much make the difference up right away. You get exercise, you don't need to look after the bike (just check it in and check it out) and there are so many stations that they're never too far to walk from. I started using CB to get to work and back everyday since if I wanted to go to an impromptu happy hour I could just go and didn't need to worry about the metro or looking after a car or bike. I biked to work year round (thermal pants help a lot during winter) and it was one of my favorite parts of living in DC. The only downside are 1) if it rains you will get soaked and 2) sometimes it's hard to find a bike or return a bike right at 5pm or 8am depending on where you live/where the major commuters are going.Seriously if you're hesitant just get a yearly membership (it was $75 when I was there in 2015). You'll really get to know the city better and save a lot of money on transportation (if your trip is less than 30 min it's free and you can always check in the bike and check it back out again). My only regret with CB is that I didn't get a membership earlier."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/02/2016,"While the concept is good the hidden fees and the fact that you need to return it every 30 minutes is hard to swing for a tourist who doesn't know the city well. Additionally, if you finally find a bike spot and it's full you are charged for something you can't even control and you are charged A LOT. You might as well take a taxi. They need to redo their contracts/policy to adapt to this problem. Or put up a lot more docks compared to bikes in order to prevent people from getting constantly charged for something that is out of their hands. I would recommend an hour stretch versus 30 minutes. It's just not enough time to tour or travel the city well and find a docking station that is open in time. Also, their customer service could use some major changes/new blood. The current staff is neither helpful nor very courteous."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/05/2017,"There are definitely a lot of self-centered idiots who don't read directions or like to follow their own rules when using this service.  Capital Bikeshare is a godsend.  I've had it for three years and have seriously saved hundreds of dollars and ridden countless times.  My list on dockings is several pages long.Tourists!  You only get a half hour to redock for free.  If it's full, re-insert your credit card and get a new code.  You get an extra fifteen minutes to find another station.  Also, yes!  Docks will be full at certain times due to traffic patterns.  You will have to find a new dock and sometimes have to walk a few blocks to your destination.  The horror!Homies who are complaining!  Follow the rules and suck it up if you have to walk a little bit.  And if you are afraid of it getting stolen, always dock it.  Make sure the green light goes on, then lift up the back seat to make sure it's securely docked.Finally, I had one bad experience with them.  I accidentally pulled a bike with a flat tire and it wouldn't redock at any station.  It was 4 in the morning and I left a message with the help desk and I went to sleep.  I forgot to call back to check to make sure the problem was resolved.  They charged me $75.  I then made my case that if they check my records, the bike had a flat tire.  They charged me $35 instead.  I was fuming like a lot of complainers on here and thought about writing a scathing review, but I'm glad I held back.It's an awesome service that will save you hundreds if you just follow the rules."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/19/2016,We loved using the Bikeshare. We liked always having access to bikes. It made it easier to get around from place to place. One of the tricky things with Washington D.C. Is that it is so spread out. It's hard to get to everything. The Bikeshare allowed us to see everything quickly and with little hassle. Our only complaint would be that many of the stations have old touch screens on them. Some of the touch screens don't work very well. They need to be updated to something better or more durable.
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,05/23/2015,"This is a really nice way to get around DC without wasting so much time and energy on walking everywhere. The stations are fairly conveniently located around town and the process wasn't too hard to figure out. I used it twice and both bikes seemed to be in good condition. I appreciate the little storage thing in the front that fit my purse perfectly, and the bell is nice for politely telling people to get out of the way.I researched this a little bit online before I took my first bike, so I was aware that I had to dock it within 30 minutes to avoid the surcharges. I don't remember it being blatantly obvious at the kiosk, but the policy is pretty clearly stated on their website and we live in the age of smartphones, so I don't fault the company for their pricing strategy. It might be a logistical nightmare, but if there's any way it's possible to rent helmets (I'd even be willing to pay a fee), this would be a good option for safety-conscious tourists like me who don't think to pack one and don't really want to buy one just for a day or two. Also, I like that the map on the website tells you how full or empty a rack is, but looking up the map on my Android phone was kind of a pain. Maybe having an app would help remedy that."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/19/2014,"It was worth 4 stars untilI checked my bank account and they overcharged me by $108 dollars, the customer service lady was French and rude and wouldn't hand me over to a manager. not to mention they put a $100 hold on your account per bike. I'm still waiting for that to get credited back. But being overcharged for false advertisement is worth calling the company to complain and then calling my bank to report fraud. these bikes are a rip off, it's not 24 hours for $7 so tourist beware!!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/27/2015,"Bikeshare has been a serious boon for me. I don't own a bike, but it has helped me get to work, to church, to friends' homes, and go on an occasional fun visit to the Cat Cafe in Georgetown. The bikes are workhorses, a bit heavy but they get you around, and for trips of only a few miles, they are pretty comfortable.  They also fit my purse and/or backpack in the front basket/cart.  In fact, one time I strapped a small cooking pumpkin in the front after visiting the farmers market. The lights are a lifesaver since I'm not always sure whether it will be dark when I'm riding home.  As they have expanded their racks, it has improved even more.Tip: I advise getting the Spotcycle app to see where bikes/open docks are available. It is pretty accurate and quite up-to-date."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/12/2017,"IMPORTANT WARNING... YOU MUST DOCK YOUR BIKE EVERY 30 MINUTES OR YOU WILL BE CHARGED EXTRA EVEN IF YOU HAVE A 24 HOUR PASS! I thought this was a fun and reasonably priced way to see the monuments around Washington DC with my 2 kids but once I got home I found I had be charge an extra $114 all because we didn't know we had to dock the bikes every 30 minutes. I've never used this service before and it's not clearly stated for a newbie that even if you have a 24 hour pass you can only have a bike out for 30 minutes at a time. I thought that with a 24 hour pass I didn't have to monitor my trip time. So when I thought I was paying $24 for 3 bikes for a 3 hour ride, I ended up paying a total of $138. An Uber would have been cheaper! This review is a warning to anyone new thinking of using this service so you don't get trapped like I did."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/09/2014,"Agree with a lot of the reviews below: Great for tourists, not for commuting. Also lots of convenient locations, especially close to Metros and sights. Best to use with an app, but not neccessary  A note: you pay for convenience, the hourly rate is kind of pricy, I believe it's somewhere like $7 for the day, then $6ish per 30 min. If you're going to bike all day, this is not a great option. Instead, rent a bike from a shop for the day. This is good for biking in spurts throughout the day. Suggestions: biking around the Mall and monuments, definitely a time saver! Sizing: all the bikes look the same size and are good for teens to adults. I am 5' 2"" and had no problem lowering the bike seat. May be a bit difficult under 5' and over 6' 3"" or so would be my guess."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/14/2016,"This company is misleading. Don't rent from them. There are a lot of hidden fees. On top of it all, their customer service is extremely rude."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/30/2017,Amazing experience touring he capital on bikes.  They worked great! Kids loved them.  I didn't completely read the fees portion so I messed up regarding the 30 min return policy!  I contacted the customer service to better understand the fees and they were extremely helpful.  I would definitely recommend to family and friends.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/26/2017,"We were visiting from California for a long sight-seeing weekend with our young teen-age boys....so looking to optimize the Mall experience and not intent on penny-pinching.  Capital Bikeshare was one of THE BEST parts of our trip.  Super easy to use, bikes were sturdy and resilient, and it was worth every penny to be pedaling to all the monuments and museums rather than wasting time on foot.  Of course we would have loved to walk if we had all the time in the world, but we didn't.   NOTE:  only two bikes are allowed per credit card, so plan ahead if you're a bigger family/group."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,04/10/2017,"Most of the time this service works efficiently but increasingly bike stations will not have any bikes available and anywhere from one to three bikes that need repair. Alternatively you will try to return a bike to a station with multiple slots free, but there is a glitch in the system.  I get the impression that no one is driving the train. Are any progressive city politicians paying attention to this. Get some better management."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/20/2015,"First lets start off that people need to understand how this system works.  Most of the complaints here are because they do not read or understand how the bikeshare works.  Do people really think they are getting a bike for $8.00 a day and that is it?  It is a membership and if you go over 30 minutes without checking in the bike there will be extra charges.Do keep in mind there will be bike stations that have no bikes or there are no docks.  There will be bike that do not work and docks that are broken.You want to make sure if you are riding and pass a bike station to check the bike in,.  You can not be sure your destination station will have empty slots.  You can get 15 minutes extra time if there is no slots to drop the bike.  However you need to know where the next station is.  That may also be full.  There are maps of the locations at the stations but there is no place at the station that you can check the status.  There are apps available for cell phones but they are not that reliable.  They are not always up to date or the app does not work.  The Capital Bikeshare app it has for itself never worked.  Try Spotcycle or others.We had two bikes and rode about 15 miles over the two days and 2 1/2 hours hours of use,  It was easy to check in the bike and get the same bike out again.  There we a few spots there were no empty slots.  What we did if there was only one slot was to check in one bike, get it out again and check in the other bike and get that out again.  That we we got another 30 minutes until we could find an open station.  One time we had to go to 3 stations before we could return both bikes together.  One time we had to check-in and leave one bike and then go drop the the other bike at the coral bike station at 13th and New York Ave then walk backKeep in mind commuters ride the bikes to downtown to work and take them back near their home.  We found walking and riding around that most of the bike stations where full around the downtown area and the museums.during the day with people waiting for an empty slot to open up.We used the bike system for 2 days and had a day key card for convenience.  We could have got a day membership or 3 day membership but then you have to use a code each time.  There is also the question of the deposit charged for each bike.  I never got a clear answer from customer service on this.  We were not charged a deposit with the day key card.There is also a problem with Capital Bikeshare answering e-mails.  They don't respond.  Not once did they respond to any e-mails I sent in weeks prior to the trip.  I ended up calling most times.. I also brought it to there attention of the negative reviews here and other sites that they should address.  They did not seem to care.Still we wanted to give this a try.  It worked out fine even with the hassle of finding a open bike station to drop a bike.  The bikes are nice and study and easy to use.Give it a try but know how it works!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/22/2017,I love the red bikes around D.C. Its very affordable and convenient for everyone. Will definitely rent again when I go back. It made my trip more exciting and saved a lot of time. I don't have to walk everywhere note. It's a must have in your to do list while down in D.C. Only thing I wish it was different was if I was able to rent more than two bikes at a time with the same Card.
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/29/2015,"The the bikes themselves are great. They are easily adjustable, have sufficient safety equipment like front and rear lights, and are comfortable enough.However, the system which includes the rental terminal is an absolute nightmare to use! The touch screen is so unresponsive it took me over 10 minutes to rent a bike."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,12/19/2014,"It's a very ""you get what you pay for"" concept. These bikes are made to be durable and will not compete with any bike you would buy yourself.The benefit is you can bike around the city and just leave it when you're done. No need to come back for it, worry about it, etc. They have bike stations virtually anywhere you'd want you go.Definitely worth the annual fee!  I feel like I'm getting my money's worth."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/06/2017,"DONT USE!!!!!Warning, it is a scam. We purchased $8 for day, the first stop we put in bikes and one didn't register. They continue to charge $8 every 30min. Turns out it was there error as the bike was clicked in but not registering. We waiting half the day with customer service who was not helpfulI think they do this on purpose to make more money as you would never know there is an issue and they have your credit card number.Customer service was smug in saying you signed the agreement so we can legally do it"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/19/2016,"I took a 10 minute bike ride to get from point A to point B and rented two bikes. I docked the bike immediately and should have paid no more than the $2 charge for it's use. The system did not register me returning the first bike, but did register the second. Apparently Robin, the supervisor at Capitol Bikeshare thinks I rode the bike around from 11pm until 7am and charged me $94 for the ride. There is no reasoning with them. Their decisions to not refund me was based off of their system, which did not register my bike's return in the first place. If you are having ANY issues with charges, don't expect customer service to make the right call. I am very disappointed, as I have used the bikeshare many many times, and unfortunately this will be my last."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/04/2014,"Optimally, you would want a smart phone and an app with this system. But even with paper, you could be very very happy.Pluses:With an app, you are assured access to bikes and parking.If you got no app, there are lots of stations. They give you extra time to find a parking spot.Easy.Cheap.Solid bikes that ride well & even have ringers!Fairly stress free: DC has wide sidewalks & except for downtown where the streets are wide.Down side:You need your own helmet.  Also, if you want to travel outside of stationing area, or don't have a pal to baby sit the bike while you run into a store, you need a lock.If you don't have smart phone with app you could get stranded and Real Pissed Off."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/10/2015,Coolest concept ever. So easy and simple to use you don't even need to use the app or become a member. I highly recommend to to tourists and locals alike. My boyfriend and I recently used bike share to bike from AU all the way down embassy row to DuPont circle. It was upper fun and very scenic and interesting to be able to see all the embassies and stop when you wanted unlike in a car. Thanks capital bikeshare for making it hassle free for my boyfriend and I to use your company! ***First 30 minutes free. I forget the rest of the fees but know it's only $8 for the entire day which is super cheap in my opinion!
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/13/2015,"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!! Capital Bikeshare is as corrupt as the men and women in Congress.Go to Bike N Roll and pay a flat fee for a 24 hour period. Buy your own bike if you live in DC!Both options are way cheaper!!Yes I know I should be an adult and read the fine print whenever I agree to terms. Or maybe I should have reviewed their website because unlike their kiosks, they are clear about the outrageous charges after the first 30 minutes. BUT why would I do that when I am spending the holiday weekend in DC and just want to rent bikes to move around the city?  The kiosks are deceptive and only mentions the 24 hour pass purchase for $8 and I'm sure mentions the hidden fees in the 60 page terms of agreement. Of course when I got to check my credit card, I find a nice $100+ surprise charge. I cannot recommend and hope no one else falls for their deceptive practices. Seriously Bike N Roll or a local bike shop is the way to go. At least you know the prices up front ."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/28/2017,Pay attention to the charges- the 24 hr pass is for 30 min at a time so you have to dock it every 30 minutes.  This isn't clear at all at the kiosks. Otherwise they charge you $8 every 30 minutes and you can imagine it adds up quickly. Not worth it.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/30/2016,I tryed to rent a bike the first terminal wouldnt respond second one took my code but didnt unlock the bike the man on the phone then tells me ill have to use a different card but he would refund my money. Therefore i cant use the same card ill have to use another. I dont believe in cards so i only have one. Why shouldnt i be able to reuse the same card. I uber drive in dc and would recommend capitol bikeshare to tourist. Never again will recommend your service to anyone.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/12/2014,"So much fun rt after our dinner date in Capital Hill we decided to grab Two bikes to check it out instead of riding the train. We rode our bike using WAZE to make it back to Columbia Heights. A 3 mile ride about an hr and 20 min walk so about an hr ride. We got misguided a few times bc our GPS didn't have bike GPS so it took us about 1hr and a half but it was super super fun. Burned all the calories I ate from Pound the hill which btw DELICIOUS...  The cost is a hold of $105 per bike but you get that back,  $7 cost and additional $2 per hr or you can the 3 days pass which now I wish we should have done. There's also a yearly plan of only $70. That's what we're getting... So much fun to learn our city. Priceless moment."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/12/2016,"Beware of SCAM fees:I rented a bike for the 24 hour pass ($8).  We returned it after two hours and made sure it was securely returned. I was then charge a $22 late fee by the company for keeping it over 30-minutes, even though I had the one day pass. I am contesting this as a fraud charge with my bank. Their pricing page is misleading and their customer service number doesn't assist at all. I wish this had been a more honest company."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/17/2015,Completely predatory practices. I rented 2 bikes for 24hrs ($14) it was not made clear in any of the material that you have to dock it every 30 mins other wise you will incur additional costs (in my case $28). It does not make it clear anywhere that you need to dock the bike every 30 mins. Customer service is rude and did not want to help out with this issue. I would steer clear of this bike rental.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/03/2016,"I thought that because I was a DC resident and was aware of the tourist accidental full-day rental reviews, that I'd be okay.  I was wrong.I rented a bike for 10 minutes.  I had some issues with the one docking station (there were only two available), but after a couple of tries the light flashed and the bike locked into place-- I checked that it locked because of my difficulties.I look at my account the next day, and it claims I've had the bike for 5 hours.  I email customer support.  They note that they did have my bike at the station after 10 minutes, but there was an error message.  They claim company policy is to only give a 50% refund, no matter what.  I call them.  They say that the phone support is not authorized to do anything beyond give a 50% refund, and they don't even communicate with the company itself which makes the policy.  They can't even give me a contact person, just a generic support email address that never responded. Their practices are incredibly fraudulent, and they really need to be investigated."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/25/2017,"It is a good business practice to make sure customers understand potential fees! How hard would it be to say...check your bike every 30 min to avoid potential fees? This is fraud! I feel violated because I read the sticker over and over and no matter how many times the representative on the phone repeats to me what is says...it is still unclear to ME!!! So those that don't understand are stuck with being screwed!! This experience has made me very angry. The intent was to mislead, otherwise they would publish a simple instruction--check your bike every 30 min or else!!! Will never use this company again for shear principle. I spend my money with good people and not with those who rely on fraudulent business practices to get a few extra dollars."

After my ride i secured the bike in a duck but at a different location i had picked it up. Went home and noticed my credit card was charged for $70.!!!!!Called bike share and the guy at the customer service was not responsive at all and seemed to not be aware of their own policies. He told me because u dropped it off at a different location the bike was available until next person used it and the securing process hadn't worked. Next time drop it off at the same location and i'll talk to our manager to see if you can get 50% refund on the charged amount. BULLSHIT!Never got a penny back!I was an idiot renting a bike for the second time thinking that if I drop it off at the same location i picked up it will be fine.Finished my ride in George Washington pkwy trail in 1hr &45 min and this time even dropped it at the exact same duck ""thanks to God it was empty"" hoping it will be less than 12-16$ aside from min 8$ fee.Guess what?! I was charged for 94$!!! Called them again and the same guy said u had to make sure bike was secured when u returned it. IT was secured and I couldn't even move it :)) i even heard that beeping and lucking sound...he said no i can see from ur trip that it lasted for 16 hrs something. Then here he goes again: i ask our manager to review this and give u a 50% refund...! I'm so disappointed with ur shitty service and ducking issues..how the hell i'm supposed to know the duck didn't secure my bike nor did sent u a signal that it's returned? Huh?And how can i prove it to u that I returned it less than 2 hours? Please at least provide a receipt from the same machine showing the return time and amount charged and description of charges for God sakes you thieves!!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/15/2015,"PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS It seems a lot of the unhappy reviews revolve around misreading (or ignoring) the 30-minute rule with the bikes and therefore paying a hefty overage fee... and DANG yeah it can get pricey. But if you stick to the rules... $8 for a full 24 hours is an awesome deal! Between that and the metro there was never a need for my tourist self to get a car.THERE'S STATIONS EVERYWHERE. Especially in the tourists areas--there's like a bike station a short walk from every memorial. Getting the station's app is very helpful because it not only shows station locations, but they show how many bikes are available as well as how many places to return your bike (We had trouble in some less visited areas because the bike racks were totally full and we had to double back and return our bikes elsewhere)BIG AND BULKY BIKESI'm a petite lady who rides a road bike. It took me a few minutes to get used to these--as cruisers they just seemed HUGE plus I never got fully used to the wide placement of the handlebars. But once moving I never had problems with the bike itself."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/12/2017,"Buyer beware....the 24-hour day pass sounds awesome, and a bike is definitely the best way to see DC. Note, however that you can only take bikes out for 30 minutes at a time. Kiosks are not clear, so be sure to look at the fine print in the website.  Our $16 quickly became $60+. Very frustrating."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/12/2016,"Tip: do not make the rookie mistake I did. Check to make sure there are open docks where you intend to return it. I got giant blisters walking and thought I'd be bright and grab a bike to go the remaining 1/2 mile to my house. The dock outside was full. I had to try three others and then walk 3/4 mile home in the end. Plus it was locked in first gear, so basically impossible to get enough momentum to not be wobbly.  I take back most of the bad things I've said about terrible riders weaving around my car as I drive."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/21/2015,"Overall, I like that it was only $18 for three days and their are many stations throughout the city. I love biking and I think this is an excellent addition to the city except for one thing. I think the $100 security deposit is a little ridiculous and they do not return it for 7-10 days. Sorry I did not have time to read the 87 pages on the little screen at the station when I registered for the pass. Chicago, Minneapolis, and NYC did not charge deposits when I rented the bikes in those cities..."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/15/2016,"BEWARE SCAM: misleading and deceptive: I got charged $248 for 1 dayCapital Bikeshare expect you to get the bike and return it every 30 minutes, how absurd is that? When you read the sign or website it seems that it is $2 per ride or $8 for 24 hour but it is NOT.First day they charged me $16 for 2 bikes and the second day they charged me $248. Make sure to read other reviews on another sites, there are many people complaining for similar issues and same problem that I had. I wrote and called customer service, they simply do not care. If you try to return the bike and the station is full, then you are stuck with the bike and you will get charged enormous fees. If I had know that I would have purchased 2 bikes instead and gave them away to people in need. This is plain wrong, misleading and deceptive. This practice is a dishonest way to make money by deceiving people. I got charged 1450% more than what I was expecting to pay. C'mon, this is outrageous!This is a scam! and how can this be endorsed by government agencies? It is a shame that they use our united states capital name to make it such a deceptive business. I am very disappointed and upset to have been misled and over charged.Visited Memorial Day Weekend May 2016"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/26/2017,"My review is based on my experience using the 24-hour pass. There are very few situations where it makes sense to buy one of these passes when you will still accrue the same usage fees you would without one. Despite their staff claiming it is clearly marketed, it isn't. Take a close look at your price options before you use one of these."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/28/2015,"So on my recent trip to DC, we bought metro passes, and well their bus system was awful, and the subway was a little bit better.  So we ended up walking a lot.  Our feet started to hurt and we wanted to have some fun with Bikes.  We read over the very lengthy and semi-confusing pricing.  So basically, you pay for a membership, which allows for free rides for the first 30 minutes and then it's an extra $2 for the next 2 hours? I believe, but then it gets stupid.  It's like an extra $8 for every 30 minutes after that.  Granted, I understand what the point of this program is for, but that is just plain price gauging.  There is a cap for max spending but I believe it comes out to be almost $100 per day if you go past a certain amount of hours.  We figured we would use it for less than the 2.5 hours and those overage charges would not come into play.  They have a physical map and they have an app.  The app is quite useful, as it tells you how many available bikes and/or slots there are at each particular location.  The problem is, one, there was way more bikes than return slots, so even though there was a station near by it was no use to you to return.  And then other places by the time you got there the slots might have filled up, so we were in the 3.5-4 hr range by the time we could return the bikes.  We got hit pretty hard.  Overall, I would have went with a flat rate daily charge from one of the other vendors such as bike and roll.  But if you use this service purely from 1 stop the next, it's amazing!  Proceed with caution!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/14/2017,I wish I read the reviews prior to renting it. This is a perfect scam! How can you advertise it as something thats perfect for tourists to tour monuments? Also they notify you over usage by email even though I chose text.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/29/2016,"This is the biggest waste of time and money. They are misleading with their information. I paid $16 for two 24 hour bike passes. I was then charged $22 two days later. This was due to not docking every 30 minutes. First off, who rents a bike to dock every 30 minutes, second how can you plan a route to have docking station every 30 minutes. THIS IS A SCAM!!! I will never use Capital Bikeshare again and I will tell everyone/anyone to never use it."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/26/2013,"I had so much fun using capital bikeshare. I've lived in the city 2 months now and I've seen the kiosks everywhere, and tourists using them all over downtown but for whatever reason it never appealed to me. I guess I was too intimidated by crazy DC drivers! Today I decided to go for it, from Dupont to the White House, around tidal basin and the memorials, to Lincoln, and back up constitution and then 15th to our final docking. It was a really fun experience, mostly due to the downward slopes and big sidewalks, but it was also a really nice change of pace from the metro and walking everywhere. I will definitely use this in the future."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/10/2016,"Beware. They will charge $$$ and claimed you did not return the bike. I used the bikes for over two years to bike to work. I clocked over 3000 miles on the bikes. I would state that the system has significant problems. First, the bikes are good and they rarely breakdown. However, there many negatives. The slots to return the bikes do not work on a consistent basis. I would guess 35 to 40 percent of the slots at some stations are inoperable. Consequently, you can attempt to return the bike and do not know if it is in fact returned unless you get a green light, which takes several minutes to happen. Many times you will not get a green light and can't move the bike to a new slot. You call customer service and they are clueless, don't care, and have no ability to fix problems.This continued to happen for many months when I used the bike. I complained and nothing changed. I returned the bike one day and Bikeshare claimed it was not returned. They charged me a significant sum claiming I did not return the bike. Then, Bikeshare discovered I returned the bike and still charged me for it.(?????). I mentioned the problem and they did not care. The customer service is terrible and unresponsive. There is a problem with bikes availability at many stations. As of December 19, 2016, the problem remains an issue. Clearly, there needs to be changes in the system to make it work. I don't know when that will occur.  Update: I have discovered new bikeshare programs that don't use slots and are available in DC. They seem cheaper and don't use slots. I would go with them."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/20/2016,"Capital Bikeshare is a a great concept that needs to seriously look at their pricing. The other day I rented two bikes. On the computer screen it said that I had each bike for a 24 hour period and that I would be charged $16. We joyously rode the bikes for 2 hours and then returned them. A few days later, two charges from Capital Bikeshare appeared on my credit card - one for $16 dollars (2 bikes for 24 hours) and the other for $44 dollars. I called the company and the woman explained that when you rent a bike you only have it for 30 minutes and then you have to return it for another bike. The concept of this is absolutely ridiculous in my mind and I would much rather spend $20 renting a decent bike for a day then using one of their crappy 3-gear bikes. I am so disappointed by their misleading 24-hour price and will not be using their services again."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/09/2016,"BE AWARE OF ADDITIONAL FEES IN THE SMALL FINE PRINT!  My wife and I used capital bikeshare to bike around the national mall, which was great.  However, I was shocked to see the additional fees added to my credit card after my vacation was over.  What I expected to cost us only $16 for the day, ended up costing us $76.  To put that in perspective, we had paid only $80 for a lengthy bike tour that was led by an experienced tour guide.  Capital Bikeshare makes you believe that it will be only $8/day.  However, you have to return the bike every 30 minutes for that fee to apply.  Otherwise, additional fees are added.  They need to clearly state that it is $8/day + an hourly rate if you go over 30 minutes.  This disclosure needs to be included up front and not buried in the fine print that no tourist will ever read on a hot day.  This is obviously a ploy to obtain additional money and is an unfair business practice!"

DC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/23/2015,"Great to tour the city or bike through trails! I biked from Alexandria, VA to Georgetown, DC, the National Mall and then back to Alexandria this Saturday. Didn't think we would make it using Capital Bikes, but the ride was pretty smooth and easygoing. We had no trouble at all renting the bikes nor finding stations. Please note: After you return your bike, if you want to get another one within your membership time, you have to use the same credit card from your previous transaction. Click on rent a bike, and you will be given a new code to unlock. You will only be charged for the additional time you use! Furthermore, you may check the cost of your trip using the machine once the bike is returned."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/23/2013,"We used Capital Bikeshare to get around DC during a recent trip down to see the blossoms.  We had come with friends, one of whom had trouble walking, so we decided to give the bikes a try.  I personally thought the kiosk had clear information about pricing to include the usage fees so no problems at all there.  There are plenty of kiosks throughout the city and you can return the bike to any one of them.The bikes were three-speed, in decent shape, comfortable and easy for even the inexperienced rider in our group (me) to navigate.  We had so much fun riding around DC on these, we went out and purchased some bikes this past weekend.  Looking forward to getting out to ride this spring/summer and all with thanks to Capital Bikeshare.  What a great concept for getting around the city easily!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/10/2015,"I love Capital Bike Share. That being said, there are a few things you must pay attention to. My husband and I are locals and have our own bikes, but since we moved out of the city to Arlington, we've been taking advantage of the bike share service and it's great! We either ride the bikes to the metro or ride them into downtown via the Washington & Old Dominion and Mt. Vernon trails. And then we spend our day wandering the city, dropping off and biking up bikes from various stations throughout the day. It's awesome and so much better than having to deal with our own bikes on a day out - plus we can Uber home if we decide to later. I also use bike share for work so I can decide at the end of the day if weather and plans permit a bike ride. A few things to know: 1. In addition to the membership fee, you will get charged a small fee per trip if you ride over 30 min and a larger fee for 60 min, and it increases from there. So try to always dock the bike before 60 min. You can dock it for less than a minute and take it right back out again.2. If you are planing to pick up a bike somewhere in the city and dock it in Georgetown on a Saturday - EVERYONE else has the same plan. Look at the real time app to see what docks have space available and know that if you're going to Georgetown, you may want to dock somewhere else and walk in. 3. Always wait for the green light when you dock it - that means it has registered as returned - if you don't get a green light, it didn't dock. On rare occasion, the station isn't working correctly and it won't register as returned even if you do get a green light. This has happened to me twice. I called customer service. Someone answered quickly each time and resolved the issue to my satisfaction. So - it's good to know they will work with you if you encounter any problems. 4. The bikes are heavy. That means you will be slow and aren't going to carry them up any stairs. But that also means they are sturdy and comfortable for most riders - the seats are comfortable too.In sum - I really love this for commuting and exploring the city. It's great for tourists, but as a local who rides my own bike on the trails, I love this for my leisurely weekend exploration of the city and for commuting."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,11/12/2010,"Build bikeshare, and they will ride? Looks like it! I've been seeing these babies zip by all over Capitol Hill. (yelp.com/biz_photos/Flml) Check out all of these stations!!(capitalbikeshare.com/sta)First off, I haven't really ridden a bike since my tween years, so comfort and ease of use were big factors. Three speeds seemed to function pretty well, and the brakes were very solid. I also like how there is a default light on the bike that flashes at night. The bungee was handy enough to secure my medium sized purse to the front. The $5 a day system and kiosk was very easy to use: just keep in mind that they do have a $100 hold on your account for a few days, so I would be careful which card you put it on. Also, it's only free for the first 30 minutes, with unlimited check ins and take outs during a 24 hour period. It's clearly stated on the stations I've seen, but keep that in mind. Not sure I need to scroll through 100+ pages of disclaimer and agreement on a tiny electronic screen, but it works.  The annual fee is now $75, and monthly is $25. Allegedly, they'll send you a key in the mail within a week and you can get riding!The main reasons I did not get a yearly membership is because I'm still not sure how bike friendly DC is (Capital bikeshare has a station on 16th and Columbia NW, are they trying to kill people?), I'm pretty klutzy on a bike and walking is safer, and because I'm short. Not insanely short...just somewhere between 5'2"" and 5'3"". The bikes, even on their lowest settings, are just a smidge too high for me to put my feet on the ground. However, the seat is fairly easy to adjust, and I would encourage  the less vertically challenged to take a spin.Capital Bikeshare also has a pretty extensive network, and not just right next to metro stations. I like that they have H St NE stations (smartbike didn't even have ANY stations on Capitol Hill). They do need to create an online app so you can check where bikes and free spots are though. I can tell that some stations are always full or always empty, and it would be nice to check it from a phone instead of on a computer.UPDATE: They do have an app now to check on kiosks to see how many bikes/open slots they have. Check out SpotCycle on Android or Apple."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/31/2016,This bike rental is a scam. Unless you re-check the bike in every 30 minutes they will bill your credit card an additional $8 for every 30 minutes!!
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/27/2016,"It was nice riding the bikes, but it is frustrating because there are not often bikes at a lot of the stations. In addition, you must return the bike within 30 minutes to not be charged extra, which can be tricky. I also was charged $100 after riding for not properly ""docking"" the bike, although there are no clear instructions and the dock makes you think the bike is locked because it locks it for 2 minutes apparently and then rejects it. I could BUY a bike for $100. It is ridiculous that they would charge so much after letting you think that you docked the bike properly. And the customer service agent was absolutely unhelpful and rude. Their policy is to only refund 50% - must be nice for them to always be making money off of people with hidden fees! I WILL AVOID IN THE FUTURE."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/05/2016,"VERY misleading company! Buyer beware! We authorized $40 for five 24 hour passes and ended up being charged a total of $162. They lead you to believe you have unlimited use for 24 hours. This is not the case. We loved biking around the National Mall, but Capital Bike Share is NOT the way to go. They have a great product. It's too bad they take advantage of folks. Clean up your act, Capital Bike Share!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,02/27/2015,"I've had an annual Capital Bikeshare (CB) membership for only about a month. Since the CB started I debated whether or not it would be worth it for me. I live in Alexandria and work in DC so using CB to commute to/from work isn't an option since the nearest station is (currently) over three miles from my house. I decided to buy an annual membership because I had a $10 off code and the annual membership will be going up in spring 2015.  So far I've riden a Capital Bikeshare for six trips -- mostly getting from point A to point B in Alexandria, and once going for lunch in DC. These are my impressions:(1) Mostly well-placed docking stations, especially in DC -- but I wish there were many more in Alexandria (perhaps in time there will be).(2) The system is intended more for transportation than recreation. The 30 minutes ""free"" per trip and the overall nature of the bikes aren't conducive to going on long bike rides.  (I assume most customers would recognize this.)(3) So far I've been happy with the number of bikes and empty docks per station.  (4) The bikes themselves are a bit disappointing. I certainly didn't expect high end bikes, and recognize they were built with utility and durability in mind.  However, there's not very much gear range in their three-speed hub transmission. Also, the brakes are very week -- you need to plan in advance of stopping.  (The bikes use some sort of hub brake (I think), and it's possible the brakes will perform better when it gets warmer (it's winter now).) I have two personal bikes that I ride about 3,500 a year, so I'm a huge fan of bicycling (and I WABA member for several years).  I mention this because I'm probably biased towards anything ""bike"". Despite my criticism of some aspects of the bikes, I really like Capital Bikeshare. It's a great addition to the DC/MD/VA metro area that provides another transportation option."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,05/11/2016,"Great way to traverse the Mall, but be watchful of your time !  Capital Bikeshare is great, easy, and fun way to quickly zip around the National Mall taking in all the sights to see.  My boyfriend and I took two bikes from the Jefferson Drive station - nearest the Washington Monument, and proceeded on a clockwise tour around the Tidal Basin taking in the Jefferson Memorial, George Mason Memorial, Tidal Basin sights and Cherry Trees, FDR Memorial, MLK Memorial, DC War Memorial, Lincoln Memorial, Reflecting Pool, Vietnam Memorial, 56 Signers of the Declaration and pool, the WWII Memorial, the White House, finally and Capitol Hill before riding our bikes back down the Hill past the Smithsonians and returning our bikes, ultimately back to the same original station on Jefferson Drive.  Aggravatingly, between all those sights, there is only one station over between the FDR memorial and Lincoln memorial to park the bikes again and reset the 30 min free window of time.  This makes it impossible to pay the $8 for a daily pass and maintain a free charge by staying under 30 mins, as there is simply not enough bike stations to check your bike back in, not to mention you'll find yourself easily spending at least 30 mins or more at each memorial if you really take your time to relax and take in the feeling of each sight.  In the end, we were charged much more than we expected, but after doing the math it was the correct charge as advertised.  In hind sight, I would do it again as riding the bikes sure did beat walking, (there is no way possible to cover that much ground on foot and not want to kill each other from exhaustion and aching feet), feeling the wind as you bike along, and laughing the whole way riding along made the entire experience on the Mall so much more enjoyable.  Just be prepared to spend about $50 a person so you won't feel suckered when you see the charges appear on your card."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/25/2015,"These are awesome bikes. I'd say better maintained than when I had my own bike - because unlike my bike - these bikes get proper maintenance work done by bike professionals constantly. Looking up your route in advance or on a smartphone can help, especially if your destination might have a full rack. I hope the BikeShare expands with more stations and DC gets even better biking infrastructure."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,11/24/2012,"A great way to get around DC to take in sites and to quickly get around. $7 for a 24 hour rental -- can't beat that! Although I was dead tired by my last ride, and don't want to see another bike for months, this was awesome. Just return the bike before 30 minutes and you won't have to pay any additional fees. And there are so many stations, so it's super convenient. Just dock the bike before 30 minutes and take it again if you need to go further.Tip: The app is really useful to find docks and the number of bikes and spots available."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/05/2016,"My son and I rented bikes in Arlington and rode them down to the Mall and to see several of the monuments.  The quality of both our bikes was fine. They are three speed bikes which is enough. The only minor problem I had was that after I hiked my seat up and locked it into place, it very slowly slipped back down.  It was easy to figure out how to rent the bikes and return them.  The place we wanted to return them to was full so we easily got a free 15 minute credit and rode them to a nearby place.  An easy, fun experience.  Since there are great bikes paths around DC I definitely recommend giving them a try."

I have had to ride further than I wanted bcuz there wasn't a stall for my bike. Yes I had to call the number because my bike was registering at the stall as not being returned. Yes, the system is DOS- like. Yes, the bike is bulky. But it gets the job done! And I'll use it every time I visit DC."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,06/20/2016,"We were in DC for the weekend and saw all these people with Capital Bikeshare; thought we'd give it a try.  While I love the idea of this, I wouldn't use them again.  They are crazy expensive with an opaque pricing structure for one thing and secondly, they are terrible to ride.  I have a bike at home and this was like driving an out-of-control blimp on two wheels.  I'm surprised I'm still alive.  We definitely didn't get the use out of them for the price so I can't recommend.  If you are commuting or want to try something fun with cash to blow, this is a good option."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,10/17/2014,"The idea of a bikeshare is fantastic. Think of the pricing like a paid library membership where the library charges overdue fines. You pay for a membership (24 hours = $7), which gives you the right to check out one bike at a time during that window. Once you have a bike, you can use it for up to 30 min for free. After 30 min, you will be charged more fees until the moment you re-dock that bike.Whether or not it pays off depends on a few things:1) How many trips you are taking. The more, the better. (Lower per-cost use.)2) How long your trips are, individually....AKA how quickly you bike. The shorter, the better. (You'll avoid usage fees if you're only taking 15 minute hops, or re-docking in the middle of long-hauls.)3) How BIG your group is. The smaller, the better. (Groups are slow, and Uber or a taxis can make trips cheap)4) If there are available docking stations where you're going. If you can't dock the bike, there's no point.5) Whether you're biking for efficiency, novelty, environmental reasons, or something else. Biking around DC is charming in itself.Basically, any combination of the above desired factors indicates you should hope on the bikeshare train - er, bike. Unfortunately, my personal experience wasn't great.- Not enough bikes were available at our initial station- Not enough docking stations were available at our destination - nor the TWO other nearest stations (if this occurs you can request 15 more mins free, but then you still need to find a station and walk to your intended destination)- All our trips were slightly too long (we kept going over the 30 min by about 10 min)- My reading comprehension went out the window and I ended up paying $44 for two bikes to take only three trips.In a group of 5, we would have been better using Uber for the longer trips and walking the rest. But the bikes are comfy and functional if you can get one....and good luck parking it."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/10/2016,"Terrible customer service. Their system broke and failed to register my returning their bike. I called to tell them that it had broken. They said they'd fix it. Instead, they sent me a bill!  What?!  Then when I called to ask them why I was being billed they removed, ""as a one time courtesy"", the fee they were charging me, they then lectured me about returning bikes on time (which I had and which they knew I had because they had sent someone out to verify that the bike was where I said it was). Then, they hung up on me.  This kind of terrible service is typical of monopolies like CBS has in this city. The District government needs to hold them to account for treating their customers right. Meanwhile, know that if you use Capital Bikeshare and they make a mistake... They'll punish you for it and lecture you to boot!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/15/2015,"Best way for tourists to see the Capital (but start at the Capitol building and it's literally all down hill from there - we loved it! Ok, so you have to return the bikes every thirty minutes, just set the timer on your phone and switch bikes-it isn't a big deal and as a tourist and probably infrequent bike rider, stop and have a look-see of the sights!  We have visited DC a few times but on a sunny, mild day and with Capital Bikeshare bikes, we were able to see tons more in less time leaving us more time to enjoy the monuments and museums.  An added plus was that you can get closer to say like the US Capitol building easily (tour busses have to park below then you walk up the oodles of stairs- not fun).   A definite easy and hassle free way to enjoy your visit."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/19/2015,"This was perfect for me. I was a lone female using these bikes for a few days and it was great. Each bike I got was in great shape, the three gears are all I needed, convenient locations to take or leave bikes, just wish there were more farther toward mount Vernon, I would have loved to bike from Arlington all the way to Mount Vernon but I had to stop in downtown old town Alexandria and take an uber car the rest of the way. Still ok, but I would have preferred a bike. There needs to be a kiosk for bikes at Mount Vernon!!!!! Wonderful experience, great way to see DC and memorials."

DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/11/2016,"User beware! The $8 24 hr charge only gets you access to the bike. In order to not incur additional charges, you need to return the bike every 30 minutes. READ THE SIGNAGE VERY CAREFULLY. If you do this, DC is a great place to bike as a tourist."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,05/05/2012,"I love the idea of capital bikeshare... I pay a yearly fee and I get to take a big lazy red bike out ofn the street for up to a half hour an unlimited number of times. No worrying about locking the thing up because there is a docking station at the other end. I use the thing nearly every day to get to and from work. The bikes are not fun to ride, but they get the job done and you definitely don't want to steal one. And the truth is that there isn't anywhere that I would want to go on one of these bikes for more than 30 minutes anyway, so the time limit is not a big deal.So why only three stars?The good:Cheap - saves me so much money over metro.Open 24/7 - I often take a bikeshare if I'm working past metro closing.Quick - when it works the system is simple and easy. I also have the yearly pass, so I don't know about the 3 or 7 day versions. I know I've often considered using it when I'm in Toronto as well, so I would definitely use it as a tourist in DC if I knew where I was going, but not a good system if you want to slowly bike around and hold onto the bike for long periods of time. Good number of locations - There aren't as many docking stations as there are CVSs, and there definitely could be more, and you feel it for sure when you can't drop off your bike, but you don't have to go too, too far to get one.The cons:Docking stations are often empty - I tend to commute after the rush, well after the rush in fact, but the docking stations downtown are still often empty at 11, 12 or even 1 am when I'm trying to commute home. There is nothing more annoying than walking around the city trying to find an empty bike share location... this would be easier with a smart phone since they have a nifty app..Docking stations are often full - Actually the only thing more annoying than empty stations are when  you want to drop off your bike and station after station is full. I just found out that in this instance you can get extra time so you don't have to pay incredible fees,but that doesn't mean that turning a 30 minute commute into a 50 minute ordeal of frustration isn't horrible. This happens all too often for me, both coming into work and returning home, especially when the weather is nice.Bikes - too often the bikes are a bit fidgety. since there is usually only one or two bikes at the station when I'm getting it, I'm often stuck limping along on a bike with sketchy brakes, or with gears that are out of tune. The bikes themselves are just not that fun to ride either. Even though they have three gears, only one of them is workable. The other two are too high to be at all useful unless you are trying to go up much steeper hills than we have in DC. What that really means is that all you can do is coast down hill. I'm sure it is a safety feature, but it is still annoying. There has been a lot of concern about the pricing system, and I do see a fair number of tourists cruising around on bike share bikes in places that have go to be more than 30 minutes away from a station (Old town for instance on the Mount Vernon Trail). In order not to compete with regular bike rental places they put up a system that is VERY expensive for anyone who has the bike out for more than 30 minutes. That means that tourists who want a lazy cruise around the monuments are MUCH better off just renting a bike from a store that does that kind of thing. The system really isn't intended to be used like that. Of course, I can understand how I could easily not read the fine print and not figure that out, and how I'd be pretty mad if that happened to me. Overall a great idea and a good addition to the transportation environment, but there are some kinks that need to be worked out. Unfortunately, I've been using it for almost a year now, and I don't see those things being worked out."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/09/2017,"It is a good concept, although I wish the bikes could be checked out for more than 30 minutes at a time, but the implementation is poor.  Only 30% of the time can I either find a bike at a station or dock a bike at a station.  The company needs to improve."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/09/2014,"Program is catered towards tourists. If you plan to commute, it's not worth the hassle of finding a spot to park your bike on the way home. I've wasted much time riding from 21st and E street NW to Farragut North station, only to have to ride the bike all the way back to the starting point and walk back because everything between Farragut back to E street is full up. I just put in a request to cancel my membership because I don't even want this to be an option anymore.The amount of users are increasing but the capacity for parking does not."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/06/2015,Never a place to park the bike near the smithsonian until visiting hours are over.You have to get the phone app and then race all the other hot grumpy people to a bike station when the app shows a parking spot is open
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,01/30/2014,"Capital Bikeshare is a fantastic piece of the broad transportation infrastructure in DC. It's not perfect, but I couldn't be happier that it exists.That said, the negative reviews here seem to come from people who fall in two camps: 1) visitors who don't understand the pricing structure and 2) commuters who rely on Bikeshare for daily transportation needs.Visitors: the pricing structure as per the website is quite clear. You pay for a membership fee plus usage fees. The first 30 minutes is free; after that you pay. The idea that you can get a bike for 24 hours of unlimited use for 7 bucks should seem suspicious when you realize that the private bike rental companies that actually DO offer that service charge 5-times or more for it. Please take some time to read how usage fees work before racking up minutes on the bikes. It's not that hard.Commuters: balance has been a problem for the Bikeshare system since it's launched. I've been burned by full docks before. It's frustrating, I get it. Like any transportation system, it will have problems. Traffic jams are common on the Beltway.  Metro breaks down all the time. Bikeshare has its issues too. When you use one mode of transportation enough, eventually the little problems start to add up into greater annoyances. The bikes are heavy and not especially fun to ride. But again, it has its place. I have a light hybrid bike I mostly ride around the city. I have Bikeshare for when I need to make a one-way trip, or when I want to get someplace a little quicker than it would take to walk. As long as you don't need to rely on it for all or most of your transportation needs, it fits in well with the other options we have."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/11/2014,"I moved to the area recently, and got a 3-day membership a few times to test it out, before deciding if I wanted a year-long commitment. There are bike stations near my house and near my work, and both are usually half-full when I need to pick up or drop off a bike, so at that point, I would have given five stars for the service. About six weeks ago, I went online, paid my year-long membership fee, and waited for the key to show up. As of today, I'm still waiting. Their website happily explains that there's a shortage of bike keys- and they're expecting a big shipment in ""next week."" I've called, a few times, and each time they say ""next week."" Meanwhile, I'm now on month two of being charged for a service I can't use."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/22/2017,Major Pain!! Hard to find available bikes. Racks would be empty more often than not. The racks are far and few so next to impossible to make it to another location within 1/2 hr if you stop anywhere even for a shirt period. The app was useless. They make it sound D cheap and easy but it's neither!! Go else where and rent a bike for the day. You'll pay more upfront but no Hassel afterwards.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/16/2016,Very approachable on the phone if having an issue. Best thing we could have done in DC
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/19/2014,"This is a review for one of the technicians that helped me and a buddy out the other day.  To make a long story short, we had lunch the McDonalds on River Road in Bethesda and when we got back to the car, the battery was DEAD.  We were parked next to a Capital BikeShare rack and one of their techs - Larry was kind enough to offer his help with the use of some tools.  MY friend and I actually had to go across the street to the Volvo parts location and pick up a battery for his recently bought S-80.  Larry was kind enough to wait until we got back to ensure that we would have the tools necessary to install the new battery.15 min later, we were on our way.  He refused our offer of a tip and was totally an all-around cool guy.Capital Bikeshare......thumbs up for having an awesome employee!*I live in the area and have my own bike, but will recommend that you deal with a company that employs great employees like Larry!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/05/2015,Worst experience renting something!!! For three hour they changed me $ 54.25 when it was suppose to be $8.00 When I call the customer service they said they only would reimburse me 50%
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,04/07/2014,"While I love that such a service exists, the pricing structure used by Capital Bikeshare is clearly not tourist-friendly.  Now that I've seen the website I understand it, but their kiosks are misleading as they tout the low prices for short-term rides.  And it's difficult to find kiosks around the monuments, the area that would be most helpful to tourists.The fact that I did not catch on to the pricing structure is on me.  Buyer beware and all that.What's not on me is that I've got hundreds of dollars of charges on my credit card that I was not expecting.  Apparently there is a $100 per bike deposit which they don't tell you about either on their website or the kiosks.  But the customer service guy was really decent about it when I called, and he actually knocked a bit off the charge.On a positive note, the kiosks are easy to find and the bikes are sturdy.  The bungee cords for gear are a nice touch."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,12/30/2014,"It's not perfect, but for the logistically complex puzzle the bikeshare probably is, I am overall impressed. Given how expensive the metro is for daily use, and how frustrating buses can be, Capital Bikeshare has saved me hundreds on public transit overall. The only thing you can't really do with bikeshare is go for long joy rides given the fees. It is a very utilitarian sort of set up. I suppose if you wanted to go joy riding, you can always just rent a normal bike, but how nice it would be to just grab a bike from a kiosk spontaneously and just pay some day fee? I guess that would make the number of bikes at the stations a little too unpredictable though. Anyway. I am thankful for Capital BikeShare."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/01/2017,"Be careful of the fine print.  We rented several bikes and chose the $8 for 24 hour option.  They charged us almost $100 because they say we did not dock the bikes every 30 minutes.  I don't recall seeing this requirement clearly on the kiosk.  Great concept but very expensive.  When we shared our experience, another friend of ours had the exact same issue.  Beware."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/13/2014,"I have a car, Zipcar, Car2Go, two bikes of my own and an annual Capital Bikeshare membership. And I love, love, love CB. So convenient if you're heading one-way on a bike but not sure how you're going to get home. The bikes are easy to ride, and the system is easy to figure out. More than three years into their service here in D.C., the fleet management continues to get better and better -- it's rare to find a bare rack or one that doesn't have a space to leave your bike. The smartphone app is awesome, and customer service is super fantastic. I had to replace a broken membership key, and the fellow that helped me out on the phone was super friendly, and I was back up and running within a few days! Memberships are great even if you have your own bike -- perfect for out-of-town guests!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/26/2016,"Buyer beware! There is a lot of fine print with this company and I made the mistake of thinking a 24-hour pass for $8 was just that. I rented the bike in Silver Spring suburbs and rode into D.C. on the Georgetown trail. The ride was about 2 hours. Then I docked the bike and hopped on the Metro to return. Fast forward to a $30 charge on my card in addition to a separate $8 charge -- I called the company and the RUDEST person explains their punitive policy if you don't dock the bike every 30 minutes...This was virtually impossible. There were no apparent docks along the trail between Bethesda and D.C. Agent: ""You should have planned your trip better."" He honestly came off as snarky and irritated as though he frequently receives the same complaint. Newsflash: Obviously you are either intentionally or unintentionally unclear with relaying this policy. I'm guessing the former bc no one in their right minds would willingly agree to those terms. I did ask if this information was buried in the terms 120+ page agreement on the 2x4in kiosk screen. He did not know.  He did, however, let me know that it is stated on the recent (that you receive AFTER you've paid) and on the somewhere on the bike (that you retrieve AFTER you've paid). SMH.I wish I had come here first to find similar warnings. Hopefully this review bumps the complaint for the next sucker in line for this scam. Note: This is my first negative review. The single star rating is because the nasty phone agent that made a bad situation worse. WTF."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/07/2014,"After 4 years of resisting, I finally caved and bought a membership. Worth it? Absolutely. Being able to bike one way and not having to worry about keeping your own bike safely locked relieves pressure in so many different situations (plus I now have the much easier option of biking home when I decide to go for a run, which does not happen often.)The bikes are almost always well-tuned, and although they're sort of tank-like, that makes them fun to ride. It's a great system and I love having it here."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/19/2014,EPIC!I've been on this little train for over a month now just cruising the city every weekend and just enjoying the sites and sounds. Its crazy how many stations they have. Its key to have a smart phone with the app...it makes it all so much easier to maintain. The customer service is very helpful and very responsive. I haven't had a problem since I've used it over 20 times.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/15/2013,"The best way to save money on transportation, see DC, and exercise all at once. I purchased a month pass for around $25 and the key was mailed to me shortly before my trip to DC. Your pass isn't activated until you do it yourself online.There are countless stations throughout the DC Metro area and they seem to be adding more every day. If you happen to stay or live near a rack station, that means less walking for you. Once you insert your key, a beep will be heard with the yellow light lit. Once the light turns green, you can pull out the bike and your time begins. Remember, you have 30 minutes of free ride time. However, once you return your bike to another station (or the same station), you can retrieve another bike and the 30 minutes starts again. From my experience, you can pretty much get anywhere in the DC area in 30 minutes. It only took me 20 minutes to ride from Dupont Circle to National Park in the Navy Yard. You will be charged extra anytime you go beyond 30 minutes for any particular session. When returning your bike, make sure there is a beep and the yellow light is lit and wait until the green light is lit indicating that the bike was successfully returned. Before taking a bike, make sure the height of the seat is correct. Also, adjust the intensity of the gear (1 to 3) turning the right handle. Front and rear lights automatically come on when the bike is in use regardless of whether it's night or day.If you have a smartphone, having the free Spotcycle app is vital. The app will notify you of the nearest stations to your location, how many bikes/racks are available at a particular station, a map of all stations, and even a timer.Just a quick reminder. If you happen to ride to a station that is full, you can call Capital Bikeshare and they will add 10 or 15 minutes for you to find another nearby station to return the bike."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/21/2015,"WHAT YOU SEE IS NOT WHAT YOU GET.i'd like to first start off this review with the fact that i rarely, if ever, review anything on yelp. This should be the first indication that this is either the greatest thing to man or an absolute atrocity (harsh, but my feelings at the moment)I absolutely love the idea of capital bikeshare. In fact, I recently used capital bikeshare for the second time in DC to give my cousin a tour of the monuments and memorials. The idea is simple- rent a bike for what seems to be a measly $8 for a 24hr time frame and be able to travel through the city with ease by cruising through the streets. I'd like to preface this story with the fact that my cousin and I had an absolutely fantastic day full of memories that i can never and will never take back! We were able to see nearly every monument on her list in a quick and easy trip. To be honest, if i had not just checked my bank statement, I would continue to recommend this product to any tourist. However, what the extremely hard to view kiosk tells you, ""allegedly,"" in the fine print is that you are not only charged this flat rate of $8, but you are also charged additional fees if you do not DOCK your bike every 30mins........had this been clearly outlined- my cousin and i would have done this to avoid the rack up of fees that we were charged 4 days later.  We were charged 6 times the price after 4 hours because we did not dock the bikes in the randomly scattered locations. Not only is this completely, impractical, but also a S C A M. I called my bank thinking that the kiosk had been loaded with some sort of scamming material and was then redirected to a capital bikeshare employee who ruthlessly proclaimed that this was MY FAULT. Why in God's name would i rent a $54 bike................................. when i could just go on a proper tour??If you are into being ripped off, please by all means, place your credit card in their kiosks and roll out."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/22/2016,"Riders beware: the hidden fees and unauthorized charges that have shown up on my credit card have been insane. I've been using the $2 per ride option to try it out before commiting to a membership. I just ride back and forth between my apartment and a yoga studio about 2 miles away- the max time I've used a bike is 10 minutes. Well last week I had a recurring charge of $94 that I didn't authorize. When I called to ask why, I was told that there was an issue at the docking station and the station did not recognize my bike when I redocked it. So they charged me for a 21 hour rental! Who is riding a bike for 21 hours? I always make sure that the green light shows when docking but due to a supposed error they scammed me out of $94."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/22/2016,Pricing for single trip is unclear. Customer service is horrible.
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,11/13/2013,"From a DC Commuter:The Capital Bikeshare has made commendable gains:  expanding the bike culture in DC, increasing drivers' awareness of bikers, decreasing commute times, reducing dependency on cars/trains/buses, etc.  But....they have a long way to go.These bikes are actually horrible.  They are heavy, there are only 3 gears, and the bikes are sometimes in shoddy condition (either a piece is broken, the brakes aren't great, or the seat slides down as you ride).  Beyond the quality of the bikes they haven't quite figured out the basics of supply and demand, resulting in empty bike stations when you're looking for a bike, and full stations when you're trying to park a bike.  This morning, for example, I was one of about 5 bikers going from station to station trying to find an open dock.  I biked 15 blocks to work, but then I had to retrace my ride back 5 or 6 blocks past 3 full stations before I found an open dock.  This doesn't happen all of the time, but I've found full stations 4 of the 25 times I've parked bikes, and found empty stations about the same number of times.  Not a horrible batting average - but pretty frustrating when I'm relying on it as my means of transportation.Until they can open enough stations in the right places, I recommend they stage trucks at the most popular stations during the morning and evening commutes to quickly redistribute bikes."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/22/2014,"Excellent . Simple. Straight forward. Great way to cover alot in short time.I didnt really care to see much in ""the mall"" so while riding the bikes we did a ""summary"" of the sites, we did this in a fraction of the time it would take on foot.  This allowed more time for day-drinking"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/20/2013,"Great way to get around DC/VA. $7 day pass is all you pay if you stop at a station every 29 minutes (at 30 minutes you get charged $2 until 59 minutes). There are tons of stations and getting around will never take that long so it is fairly simple to keep the cost low while touring DC. The bikes are comfortable, my girlfriend is 5'1"" so she had some difficulty stopping and starting, I am 6'2"" and the seat post was plenty long. The brakes suck on all the bikes. Gears (3) change smoothly. Upright ride."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,02/21/2016,Terrible customer service--told me I didn't redock the bike and threatened a 94 dollar fee. Still don't know if I will be refunded or what. Also didn't accept American Express although they advertised that. Shaky bikes but decent enough. It was just the implementation and customer service that was horrible.
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/31/2013,"Great Idea!  I didn't read the website nor did I read Yelp before heading into DC to rent these bikes to tour around DC.  The machines and placards didn't really explain that there are additional charges. Or if it did, I didn't see it as I just saw that it was $7/day.  I rented 2 bikes, and it turned out to be $24 total instead of the $14 that I thought renting 2 bikes for a day would be.  I called the 800 line and the lady was kind enough to refund me 60% of the additional  charges.  She explained that the bike sharing program is really for a quick bike ride of 30 minutes and that is why there are additional charges after 30 min.  Even still $24 for riding around the monuments for several hours is a pretty good deal.  Now I know!capitalbikeshare.com/pri  click on link for pricing."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/22/2017,"I rented two bikes for my daughter and myself at Wilson and 31st in Arlington on July 21. We literally had the bikes for 10 minutes -- just enough time to ride to the bottom of the hill and dock them at Arlington Mill Road -- less than a mile away. This was only my second time renting from Capital Bikeshare and I didn't re-dock the bikes properly. I happened to check my bank account on July 22 about midday and noticed a charge of $62 in addition to the $4.00 rental charge from Capital Bikeshare. I called and spoke with two different representatives who explained that one bike was returned five hours later to a station on Four Mile Run and the other had not yet been returned and was still accruing charges. Maurice said they could authorize a one-time courtesy reimbursement of half of the charges -- which could not be finalized until the other bike was returned. I drove down two the Arlington Mill station and located the bike that was parked but not properly docked. I locked it into place and called back to speak with a supervisor. After calling back several hours later, I was told a supervisor would contact me at 11 pm. Irene did call me but said exactly the same. It was my fault for not docking the bike properly, the instructions are clearly printed on the kiosk, and she could only authorize half of the charges refunded. I said I found that outrageous as an annual pass costs less that my total charges -- which amounted to $157.00. I could have purchased a day pass, a three-day pass, AND an annual pass for less. I asked to speak with someone above her and was told there was no one. I called back later and asked another representative, Cynthia, for the name of Irene's supervisor. She said Ashley and Irene are the only two supervisors; there is no one above them. I find it extraordinary that a business can blindly rob people, legally. Capital Bikeshare is BANKING on novice users to make a docking mistake so they can profit. If they cared about the customer, they would notify customers via text when their time is near expiring -- that would be GOOD business. I never received any notification that the bikes had not been docked properly -- even though that is a question addressed on their FAQ page. If I hadn't checked my bank account, that bike would still be accruing charges. I am just asking for a little kindness and compassion. I understand that I made an unfortunate mistake, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Give me an annual pass OR reduce the rate to $25, and IMPLEMENT A NOTIFICATION SYSTEM to customers! I will make sure every online reviewer hears this story and I will never rent from a this company again -- absolutely no humanity!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/27/2017,"It's a fantastic idea, but it's absolutely unreliable/one of the worst services I've ever used. I rode a bike 3 minutes down the rode, docked the bike properly, and then was charged $98 the following day without warning. When I called in and spoke to customer service, they informed me that the bike was not docked until 1 day and 6 hours later. I argued that I indeed rode the bike1 mile down the rode and docked the bike properly. After several arguments relating back to the fact that the bike was found in the exact same spot, and they reduced it to $46. I had explained that I can guarantee the ""green light"" showed up signaling that the bike was docked properly, but they argued that this was not the case. It was an extremely unpleasant process that took nearly 2 hours on the phone. After reading reviews online, unfortunately I'm not the only person that's had this issue..... I will never use one of these bikes again."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/16/2013,"Greatest idea ever, or greatest idea ever? Wish we had this in Dallas (according to google, it's coming). Pay a daily price of $7 and bike around the city looking at all the landmarks and even getting from one neighborhood to another. If you dock your bike at a bike station in less than 30 minutes, then no additional charge. If you go over, it's $2 extra. 18 hours over the bike is considered stolen, if you don't dock it.So I was in DC for 2 days and my husband and I got these bikes to ensure that we could see the maximum amount of the city in the 2 days we were there. However, we saw many natives utilizing the system as well. I even rode home to the hotel after bar-hopping with friends. A much easier time than walking on my sore feet. Easy to figure out. I love things that encourage exercise and reducing our carbon footprint."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/14/2014,DO-NOT-USE-THIS-SERVICE!!!I am an exchange student so I have a card from my hometown. The machine refused my card -no idea why- and I used it with another one. Now I have TWO HOLDS on my account. ONE OF THEM I DIDNT EVEN USE THE BIKE. And now I have to wait 10 days to see IF they will credit me back!Worst service ever.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,01/29/2013,"What could possibly be better?  You can ride these bikes FREE for up to 30 minutes and then just dock it at one of their kiosks.  You don't need to lock it up, maintain it or worry about it at all.  You do have to get an annual membership fee of around $75 or so, but it's worth it.You get exercise, zoom around DC and save on cab or metro fare.  It couldn't be easier to insert your fob into the docking station and ride off and then redock when you're done.These bikes do get very expensive if you spend lots of time on them.  But you can just return the bike to a kiosk after 30 minutes and get a new bike for another 30 minutes.  Repeat as long as you want!You need to be savvy about making sure you have a kiosk with open slots where you want to return your bike.  You can check their website and/or get a mobile app for this.  Also, there is a computer screen at the kiosk that tells you how many docks are open and how many bikes are available at nearby kiosks.This system works in other cities like Paris and is a natural for DC.The bike are a little clunky, but you're not Lance Armstrong so don't worry about it!!!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/31/2011,"I love Capital Bikeshare! I just got a year membership and it is great. I don't use it for commuting to work so don't have any supply/demand issues some other do. My work doesn't have a shower and so that is not an option. Well I guess I could show up at work all sweaty and gross, but ewwwww. I've used it on the weekends and after work. After using a couple dozen times there has only been once that I have not been able to find a bike and that was in Farragut where there are a bunch of stations so no problem. I am getting a great workout and no longer have to wait for stupid metro for forever. Yay - no more metro! And I'm super excited bikeshare is expanding to even more area yippeee :)"
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/12/2013,"Capital Bikeshare is my favorite way to get around the city... when I can actually find a bike.The idea is wonderful. For $75 a year and get a fob that lets you rent a bike from any station; you get 30 minutes of bike time then you return the bike somewhere else. The problem is  half the time there are no bikes within a 1-2 miles of where I am (you can check where bikes are available from your smart phone which is very convenient). The good news is Capital Bikeshare knows this is a huge problem, addressed it on their blog, and is trying to fix it. Unfortunately their suggestion to frequent users ""just get your own bike"" seems to miss the point of why I signed up for bikeshare in the first place. If you are planning on using Capital Bikeshare for your daily commute I recommend you either leave to/from work 20-30 minutes early to make sure bikes are available or you have alternative transportation available. Ideally they would take the time to fix this problem before expanding into Maryland as it will likely exacerbate the problem.The bikes themselves are in pretty good condition and accommodate people from 5' to 6'4"" without difficulty. They are very heavy but  smooth and beginner friendly. Also when you sign up with capital bikeshare you get  discounts to many local businesses including   Zipcar and Car2Go. This is really handy if you like the idea of a bike/car share combo.I really like Capital Bikeshare and judging by its popularity so do many other people. I hope its currents problems are just growing pains and as time goes by they figure out how to make bikes available to everyone who wants one."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/22/2012,"Given that Metro was designed primarily to alleviate rush hour commuting, it's amazing that it can't even accomplish that.  ""Trackwork on Nights and weekends""... Christ I'll stop there.  I usually take Bikeshare for a short hops under a couple of miles.   They're nothing spectacular but it's a good option when your choices are a 30 minute walk, 10 minute bike ride or 20/unknown minute Metro wait.  The $7 is good for the day, so if you do it round trip, you're almost even with taking Metro and probably arrived faster. The one time I reported a maintenance issue about a kiosk, they responded by email to acknowledge it would be fixed.  Otherwise, bikes have been adequate and I don't see any surprises with pricing.Bonus points over Metro: nobody has ever tried to steal my iphone and I don't have to smell unshowered protestors from the bike."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/12/2015,"Don't try this on a busy weekend. Also, since we couldn't dock our bikes within 90 minutes (and would have to wait in a LONG line just to ""extend"" time by 15 minutes), we ended up paying an additional $8 each. So two people rode for two hours and it cost us a total of $44, which included the $8x2 registration fee for 24 hours. Not worth it at all and I deserve my extra $16 back. Also, you run the risk of docking your bike at a busy location and then there not being any bikes for you to take when you're ready to leave. If they figure out how to make it work better, it will be nice. But until then, I don't recommend this at all."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/08/2013,"If you're visiting the city and want to look adorable while sightseeing then the Bikeshare is a good option.  If you're hoping to commute to work then be prepared for a lot of frustration.Its great people are embracing the Bikeshare but trying to use this service to commute during rush-hour is practically impossible.  Most stations just outside of downtown are empty before 8:00am and it is more than likely you'll have difficulty finding a place to return a bike around downtown between 8:20am and 9:30am.  Capital Bikeshare is aware of the problem but has only advised people ""who use Capital Bikeshare frequently and for regular roundtrips, such as commuting from popular origin stations to popular destination stations, it might make sense at a certain point to just get your own bike"" and given that is the best they can do I'll pass on their own words and discourage folks from using the service for anything other than casual riding."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/28/2015,"I had a great experience with Capital Bikeshare. This was my first time using this type of system. My brother, sister and I decided to have a fun afternoon in DC before summer is over. and we enjoyed it, it was so worth it, we got plenty of pictures. This system is easy to use and they have many spots in DC to find and park it after you're done. they tell you to download this app on your phone to find map of locations: ""Spotcycle"". The system takes credit card or debit card (good thing b/c i only had debit card). The pricing is fair. You can call the tech support and they answer right away. Thanks."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/19/2016,"After you learn how the system and equipment work, this is a fantastic service.  Some aspects take getting used to, and until you've done so, you're likely to get frustrated sometimes. For example, you arrive at a docking station only to discover that there is no place to dock your bike (You have to learn to check the Spotcycle smartphone app first).  Also, most DC residents commute at similar times and in similar directions, and it's simply impossible for the rebalancing trucks to get enough bikes back out to the docking stations in residential neighborhoods quickly enough in the morning to cover everyone's needs.  I am still frustrated that there are huge areas with no docking station at all, including where I live - which is about 0.5 miles from six or seven different docking stations.  They form a chain of rosaries around where I live, but none are all that close to my home.  That last 1/2 mile is long enough that it's frustrating not to be able to ride closer, and when leaving in the morning I pass two bus stops before reaching a docking station, and often enough a bus pulls up and I just take it.  I keep hoping Capital Bikeshare will fill in with more docking stations, but I assume the problem is that the manufacturers aren't making the equipment fast enough and that it's hard to gain permissions or even find the right available sidewalk space that can be used for this purpose.  Still, I wish for more in-filling in the inner neighborhoods of DC.  Also, you have to learn to lift the bikes slightly when docking (otherwise, you sometimes don't get the green light that tells you you've successfully docked and can leave).  Some of the docking stations are wearing out and require this extra step.  But in general this system works so well for me and for others with annual memberships that I can no longer imagine living without it.  It is a fantastic substitute for car, bus, Uber, mass transit, etc., and it's essentially free, i.e., once you've paid the annual membership and assuming you don't keep the bikes more than 30 minutes at a time (which I never travel far enough to need to do).  I love it and would never want to stop using Capital Bikeshare."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/02/2016,"This company is a complete joke with the ""hidden"" fee crap.  A 4 hour bike ride cost $46, simply because they tucked away their 30 min re-docking requirements on page 87/120 of their agreement (which, as another user mentioned, is displayed on a tiny screen written in DOS).  I was extremely disappointed by this revelation of extra fees after checking my credit card statements, and then reading all the reviews.  I could have purchased a halfway decent brand new bike at Walmart for $46 had I know this.  2 star simply because riding around DC was fun & the general concept is decent.  Now if they could just fix their shady fee structure & false advertising, it may be deserving of a 4 star review."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/04/2013,"we were excited to see another bikeshare system much like the one in monteral. :) it's a great way to see the city because it allows so much flexibility. for a 24 hour membership, it is 7$. for the first 0-30 minutes, it's free. then $2.00 for an hour and so on. loves:-tons of bike stations to return to-super duper durable yet light enough for a little girl like me -front and back lights -- for riding in the dark-a little strap in area to hold you purse, backpack, small items-kickstand-very simple share systemthe only thing i didn't love was biking through the heart of dc. there are quite a few cars and they seem to tolerate the tourist/ bikers lol. it's encourage to ride on streets but i spent some time on the sidewalk. we rode these at night. got 'em in logan circle area and returned in chinatown area. all the while, we got to zip through the national mall, reflecting pool, capitol hill, lincoln memorial (ps. they don't allow bikes up there..)easily a favorite during our stay!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/05/2015,"HORRIBLE website!! Tried to find a location near our hotel and drop down box nor the address input would work. Tried cell phone, IPad and desktop. This company, which depends on the Internet should have a working site for its customers. In addition, the kiosks DO NOT ACCEPT AMEX.  So, you have to use a Visa or MasterCard....EXCEPT, you can only rent 2 bikes with 1 CC. So, if you are a family of 3 or more, you have to use multiple Visa/MasterCards. Very dumb and inconvenient. Would not use this service again. Needs to be streamlined."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/27/2013,"If I read these reviews or about the program earlier I wouldn't have racked up the bill we had for 2 bikes for 2 and a half hours. I'm not sure what I was thinking given my boyfriend having foot issues so the biking helped tremendously. It was the first time I rode a bike in about 15 years, and I was a little nervous here and there but I did it. It helped that the bike baths here were clean and easily marked, and it was nice to have wide sidewalks and paths up to the monuments and museums. The bikes are a bit heavy, but makes me feel good that it is sturdy, and it has a small basket to hold on to your purse or bag pretty securely. It was a great way to see the city. I highly recommend using the bikes and would do it again. It's quite affordable if you do it right and stop at the stations before the 30 minute mark and take out a new bike."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/22/2013,Capital Bike Share is revolutionary. We were in town for a quick 3 day tour and renting bikes from the easy to use kiosks was a great way to bike the city. We were able to bike along the Potomac all the way to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial--then dropped the bike off. The BEST way to see the city.
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,04/27/2015,"Easy and fun way to get around Arlington and DC. Their pricing is very deceiving. I emailed customer service about this and their reply was ""here is a picture of our kiosk, how can we make pricing more clear?"" Not really my idea of stellar customer service. Due to the price I most likely will not be renting again."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/11/2015,Complete SCAM. You have to return bike every 30 minutes when It Clearly says you are renting it for 24 hours... What a misleading way to earn money... Shame and will never Rent a bike from here again i was charged $188 .
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/17/2014,"Everything was fine until I was told that $200 will be held out of my account for 5-10 business days for the 2 bikes that I rented for less than an hour. I understand this is the policy, but it's still just super upsetting and RIDICULOUS to hold the money for that long."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/23/2010,"I signed up for Capital Bikeshare (or CaBi, as some affectionately call it) before it launched in trust that it would live up to expectations, and so far I'm thrilled.  Will this replace your primary transportation?  No.  Might you feel a little silly on a bright red and yellow bike?  Possibly.  Is this a totally awesome way to get around?  For sure!  Plus, it's cheap and it's green! The first thing everyone asks is about the bikes... unlike the SmartBikes, these bikes actually resemble a normal bike.  They're a little clunky, but seem to be sturdy and well designed.  Each bike has three speeds with a gear shift on the handle, chain guards, a bell, a basket in front (that surprisingly doesn't look too dorky), and front and back lights for riding at night.  In terms of comfort, for the relatively brief time that you will be on the bike, it's comfortable enough.For now, only about half of the stations are in place, but there's a Google map on Capital Bikeshare's website showing planned stations.  When complete, there will be 1,100 bikes at 110 stations through DC and Arlington, which is awesome, although until a mobile app is released (which is said to be in the works), you need to check the website in advance to find the closest station to your destination.  This time around, it appears that the District has chosen a well thought out bike sharing system that has enough coverage to be convenient and useful, and bikes that are actually worth riding.  If you're still not convinced, try it for a day, see how great it is, then sign up!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/15/2015,"I'm a yearly member of Capital Bikeshare  & used to be a big fan...but no longer.They are having real issues with their membership fobs, which in very short time no longer work  at the bike kiosks.  I had 2 fobs which went bad just in a few months apart. Getting the fob replaced the 2nd  time has also turned into a ridiculous debacle.So, the first time the fob stopped working it was easy, breezy to get it replaced- you simply called Cap Bikeshare...they popped a new fob into the mail and gave a couple 3 day passes to tied you over until your new one arrived.So, a few months later when the new fob also went kaput, I was annoyed but not excessively so because of the ease of getting a new one. Little did I know. It's now been over a month and 5 phone calls to their customer service...and still no replacement fob forthcoming. I've been give the complete runaround in the process as well, where 2 agents will say the replacement has been shipped, only to find out weeks later from a very insistent call to their management that no such shipment occurred. And management was not overly helpful either- his suggestion was that I should call the local office. Mind you, this is on the 5th call already on my part to their customer service dept yet my request then for HIM to call the local office fell on deaf ears.Now, in that interim, while they did give me day passes (some agents more generously than others) on each call to get me through the month so far, those are a bit of pain to use. It's more the total experience and inept customer service which has left a complete sour taste in my mouth.Bikeshare commuters take notice."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/14/2010,"YOU GUYS...I'm obsessed with Capital Bikeshare. I tried it out a handful of times and finally bought the $50 annual membership right before the month was up. I feel like I have already made up that amount in ""free rides"" of less than 30 minutes that I would have paid at least $1-3 on the metro or circulator. In other cases, it just gives me a connection that saves walking. I even rode one from Chinatown to Capitol Hill (okay, I walked it up the hill...) at 3am after the Harry Potter 7 premiere.In 2ish months, I've only had two instances of getting to a station and finding it either full when I have a bike to return, or empty when I need to grab one. Just yesterday I was in a rush and got to the station to find that my key didn't work and instead flashed the red light and beeped at me repeatedly. The technicians that happened to be there said to call the number and someone picked up right away and fixed the problem in seconds.The bikes are sturdy and stylish (a teenage boy I rode past near the mall exclaimed: ""Oh man! I want a bike like that!""), with 3 speeds and a bell. The docking and undocking process is super fast, and the key/keychain is small and unobtrusive. The seat is pretty comfortable as well. The tires are like what you'd find on a mountain bike. There's also a basket with a bungee cord to secure your things.The only downside of this service? Constantly being asked by people at stations or when stopped at lights what I think of it and how does it work and how much does it cost and is it easy to use, etc.! I always tell them it's worth it!"
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,12/10/2012,"Good idea. The bikes are in good condition. Major draw backs: you are ready to leave and there are no bikes.You.can't get a 30 day pass at a station. Takes 2 weeks.to receive long term passShort term pass does not transfer so if you need a bike you can pay $74 PLUS the hourly rate while waiting for your pass to arrive ----- just buy a NEW BIKE, it's cheaperI tried to join with the monthly pass but I need a bike now. I liked the idea of a bike that was always clean and in working order but it's too much to spend while waiting.  I tried calling to see if there was any way around it. If I could get a credit for the 3day passes I would need. No effort was made to address the problem.The bikes are in good condition because they are made of steel. Or lead, heavy!I would be a monthly subscriber Sweet job customer service. I have a super cute vintage road bike from Craigslist. Paid $125 for a super tune up so it's just as road worthy"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/22/2015,"My wife and I both have annual memberships and love the system. We live in the city, so the system makes it incredibly easy to zip around town. It has easily saved us more than it costs in short trips in a Lyft/taxi alone, and a huge time saver in instances where we'd walk."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/17/2014,"If I could rate 0 stars I would.  I was charged $7 originally for a bike. When I tried to take the bike the key wouldn't work and I couldn't use any of them. So I walked the 2 and a half miles I was planning to take the bike on. After I called the company to get my money bag, they told me they would hold $101 for 10 days.... $101 for a bike I didn't use... For 10 days.... Then sent me on a wild goose chase saying my bank could fix it so when I called my bank they said they have no power over the bike company and when I called the bike company back they told me there's nothing they could do and if have to wait 10 days..... Worst service, worst customer service, DO NOT USE!!!!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,12/22/2013,"Definitely worth trying! They do a better job than I would have thought possible, and they are part of the cutting-edge worldwide in urban bike rentals. Some things are a little confusing the first time. E.g., getting your ticket to unlock the bike, figuring out the lock code (""aha, it uses only the numbers 1 to 3!""), locating the nearest return spot, etc. CB might benefit by using a 'focus group' of suburban elderly people who have never heard of them, and watch carefully and LISTEN to them as the old folks try to figure out how it works. If/when the old folks get stuck, this means Capital Bikeshare is not communicating well at that point in the process (via the signage or instructions at the bike racks) -- the problem is with CB, not with the old foks. :-)   (Not that the old folks are the main users, but they are a great source of candid reactions, whereas younger hipsters might not be willing to admit they are stuck -- but the small hurdles may prevent them from using the system.) That said, once you figure it out (and figure out how to locate bike racks near you to return to, and to check if they are full, etc.), it's a pretty cool system. A lot cheaper and faster than taxis, better exercise, a way to get some fresh air between meetings, see the city, etc. Recommended!"
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,11/08/2013,"Convenience of the service is great (as long as you can find a bike to check out and find a dock to turn the bike in). The quality of the bikes is terrible. Imagine cycling on a tank. Be sure to test your breaks- I have had multiple experience with screaching breaks and low resistance!!!The Capital Bikeshare customer service is also terrible. They are inconsistent in service- the first year, my account expired after a year (understandably and I had to renew). The second year, I was simply notified that I had been charge $75+ to auto-renew. I was never even given the option!! In fact, I had expressed previously that I did not want to renew! When I called promptly to cancel this auto-renew, the customer service agent was rude. Hopefully the credit will come through and I will have no further problems."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/01/2014,Cap Bikeshare only gets worse.  They run this like an old soviet supermarket. The city gave them public space to run Bikeshare and they know they have a monopoly and are indifferent and not very knowledgable about dc -- there is a slot at ct and mass 2 blocks away -- well no it is 8-10 blocks -- but whatever.  So ride there and take a cab backKind would be to call them smart ass idiots Ugh.
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/30/2014,"Reviewing as a tourist who loves to use these bikes to get around the city/surrounding areas on a nice, warm day.For the cost ($7/per day), the bikes are nearly indestructible, easy to ride, and easy to find. There are stations all over the city, particularly in the areas that you are most likely to visit (near monuments, museums, and restaurants).The accompanying smartphone app (SpotCycle) has a nice interface, and is easy to understand after a few minutes of playing around with it. I use the bikeshare each time I am in town - for $7, you can give yourself a tour of the city (just be sure to map out your trip to avoid the surcharge that accompanies a trip greater than 30 minutes!).Edit: Note that there is a review stating that it is $6 for 30 minutes, on top of the $7. This is patently false. For any ride UP TO $30, it is free (only the $7/day fee kicks in). So if you ride around town in 20 minute increments, you will spend $7. It costs $2 for any ride that is 30-59:59... but just find a station (there are plenty) to dock and undock. Some might find this to be a pain - I think it's part of the fun of the journey."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/21/2016,"Avoid using this if you can. Their docks often do not work and they make you scramble to find another dock elsewhere. Their customer service is entirely unhelpful and they do not know how to treat customers well. They charged me after their bike dock didn't work and they refused to come out and fix it or close my account. I followed all their instructions, called customer service and emailed them. They only gave me 50% back. I will be disputing the rest with my credit card and will be reporting them to visa for for poor business practices."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,04/21/2012,"I tried this bike sharing system as a tourist, and after a few hiccups, the experience was quite good. First off -- as others on Yelp have noted -- the pricing system is unnecessarily complicated, and if you have the bike out for 2+ hours, the fees can really mount up. Having that $101 temporary debit on your card, even though it's just a hold, can be a bit of a mental blow.  All that being said, the signage DOES explain the pricing system, you just have to spend a bit of time reading the small print. It would all benefit from better design (the signage AND the pricing system). I can imagine as a local this could be a good mobility solution - and it wouldn't be very expensive once you're a member and that's all locked in. Pulling the bike off the rack once you have entered the code is relatively straightforward. But if you're a runt like me, beware - these bikes are HEAVY so be prepared to put a bit of muscle into it. They're very solid, basic, 3-speed bikes, and I found it a little hard to control at first, much harder to steer than my hybrid bike at home. But you soon get used to it. Once you're up and spinning, DC is quite easy to cycle around in, and there seemed to be quite a few stations around the place where we could return our bikes. (Although it would be handy if the bikes had a little map or something that came with them, so you could find those bikeshare stops more easily.) I noticed some racks were completely full, meaning that there was no space to return a bicycle, which could be a pain if you were in a hurry to go somewhere."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/10/2016,"Rates are confusing and don't make sense. Very expensive and poor customer service. Not tourist friendly,"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/26/2012,"As visitors to DC we found Capital Bikeshare very convenient and fun.  It was a great and inexpensive way to get out and cover alot of ground around the monuments and the mall.  We stayed with the bikes the entire time which meant when we stopped at a monument one would have to ""guard"" the bikes since we didn't bring along a way to lock them up.  And for a tourist - it probably would be a good idea to use the bikes on weekends when there are less cars out on the road."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/30/2016,"If you are a visitor to the DC area this is NOT the company for you to rent a bike from.  This company is for commuters - that's what I was told when I called about the additional charges.  Their pricing is tricky and misleading, so if you pay for 24 hours, you still need to switch bikes every 30 minutes to avoid additional significant charges.  This is written in the very small print in a very unclear way so we had no idea we would get the extra charges.  The customer service people were very rude and acted like I should never have rented one of their bikes for a ""joy ride"".  I won't do it again."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,01/29/2012,"Have a yearly membership and will never get rid of it. Your options for getting around the city are: driving, bus, train, cab, and walking. If you're out drinking, driving is out. Bus can be infrequent and unreliable, the train only goes so many places, and cabs are expensive.But, if there is a CaBi station nearby, I just use my key, hop on, and get wherever I need to go in a matter of minutes. I use it for my morning commute to get from Columbia Heights to Farragut West in 15 minutes, which is usually shorter than the wait and ride on the bus. For those who wonder, the bikes are built like tanks, and the chains and all other fragile parts are covered. They're heavy and really, really hard to crash. You'd almost have to try. There's a sturdy basket and bungee cord in the front which I have carried comically large objects in before. The staff has been great lately in fixing bikes that have been marked for maintenance -- service just keeps improving.Lastly it is a healthy and active way to get around town, while being fun. Just remember: don't drink and ride, obey all traffic and biking regulations, and wear a helmet when you have one. DC has a ways to go but it's becoming a great biking city, and it's by far my favorite way to get around."

DC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/07/2016,Capital Bikeshare riders routinely create a hazard on sidewalks in the downtown commercial district. It seems that their website and signage does not instruct riders that it is illegal to bike on the sidewalks.
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/17/2014,"Here's my dilemma: I absolutely love this idea and have used it quite a lot. My gripes mostly stem from the operations. First, it took about 6 weeks for them to send me a key. Then, I go to activate it and it doesn't work. Ugh, what a bummer. Thing is, I have my own road bike and it's much easier (read: lighter) to get around in. But I like having this option when I know I shouldn't be biking home ;) That's why when I have to wait nearly 2 months to even use it, I'm annoyed."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/10/2011,"They are pretty sleazy about how they market themselves and all these under-the-table fees they have... They make it sound like it's $5 for one day unlimited and $15 for 5 days unlimited. BUT REALLY, they end up charging you about double that, because it is ONLY unlimited if you keep each bike ride under half an hour, which is not realistic. They don't make any of this clear at their kiosks and then when I called to complain they shamelessly said they couldn't do anything about it and didn't even express any hopes to improve their flawed system. This company gets far too much credit in DC, but really their bikes are clunky, their prices are inflated, and their business style is unethical... I'll stick to buying my own bike on Craigslist and saving MUCH more money long-term.***TIP*** They are not actually $5 for 24 hours riding as they claim they are, be careful with all their hidden fees!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/05/2012,"Bikeshare gives you more freedom in your commute. I work way outside of DC and it helps me replace one or two legs of my journey. I've been a member for just under a month and I ride Bikeshare pretty much every day, whether it's for getting to work or going to meet friends.The process is seamless - there's no locking up, just docking the bike when you're done with it. I've run into issues with a few bikes that seem a little beat up but are still rideable - I make sure to hit the ""repair"" button when I arrive at my destination so someone can service the bike. The bikes themselves are perfect for their purpose: large visible bikes with thick wheels that are easy to ride for beginners (though they'll definitely feel weird at first if you're used to riding a road bike, like me).Also - one of my favorite features - on the Capital Bikeshare website, you can check the stats about the most recent 200 (or fewer) rides you've taken on Bikeshare under ""Rental History"". Metrics tracked are distance ridden, calories burned, CO2 offset, and duration of rides. For each ride, you can see what station you started and ended at, plus the cost of that ride, if any. I haven't paid anything beyond the initial membership fee yet because it's easy to keep rides within the city under 30 minutes."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/01/2016,"Capital Bikeshare is such a great idea in theory. Rent two bikes for the day to ride around for only $16? Great!! HOWEVER, their pricing structure is completely misleading. The $8 to rent a bike FOR THE DAY is actually only for 30 minutes. After this you are charged in increments, bringing our total charges for the day to $124. Apparently you are supposed to return the bike to the dock every 30 minutes to avoid being charged insane fees. What sense does that make?! And why isn't it clearly stated that this is the intention? Had we known this we could have avoided the crazy fees. Not to mention that the bikes are crappy to begin with. I would have much rather rented a decent bike and paid a little more than this. Will not be using Capital Bikeshare or recommending it to anyone ever again."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/27/2011,"Before I get into what Bikeshae is and why it is amazing, lets talk about a few things it is not:1) Capital Bike Share is not a scam.  People who gave CABS a one star review because they didn't read what they were buying, go ahead and give yourself a one star review.  99% of other people didn't have that problem.  Please sit and reflect on your credit card usage.2) Capital Bike share is not for scenic day rides around the city.  There are plenty of places that will rent you a bike cheaply for the day.3) Bike share is not done.  Paris has approximately 20,000 bikes on 1400 stations.  DC's will likely never be that big, but that is 20x dc bikes, and 12x the stations.  Many of the issues Capital Bike share has been dealing with will disappear as the system doubles in size over the next year.4) Capital bike share is not mature.  Its been around for one year and it is already one of the best ways to get around the city.  Give it some time.Now, what Capital Bike Share is:1) Capital Bike share is the quickest way to get around2) Capital Bike share is two birds with one stone (exercise and commuting)3) Capital Bike share is just as good for tourists as locals.  If you want to see this city, bike share will get you around far faster than walking, metro and cheaper than cabs by far.In four months of Bike sharing, I have yet to pay a single usage fee.  Quite simply you can get almost anywhere in DC in within half an hour.  If not, stop at a kiosk and get more time.  Simple.I have noticed, however, that as the weather has improved, it has gotten more and more difficult to find either empty spots or available bikes depending on the time of day.  Clearly the popularity is driving the need for some infrastructure improvements.Finally, I can only hope that as more and more people bike in DC, more lanes will open, and drivers will stop trying to kill me."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/24/2016,"I used Capital Bikeshare thinking it was a glorious concept. It is a glorious concept. I, like so many others was duped and drained of money$. I understood fully that my membership allowed use of the bikes in...30 minute increments. Cool, just enough time to make it from on locale to the next. Set timer, and off we go. The reality (a brief version): BikeShare says the bike wasn't docked properly, you will be charged. Here is the SKU number go back to the other side of DC, where you docked it, and read the tiny SKU numbers of all the bikes to see if it's still there. Ride over in a frantic panic. Done. Not there.  Several phone calls back and forth. No help. Three hours later a voicemail from BS: ""The bike was returned after 20 minutes, you won't be charged.""  Why couldn't they have told me earlier?! Just opened my credit card bill and...surprise, I was charged. For two trips they say that were longer than 30 minutes. I call them and let them know, I set my timer for 20 minutes, the bikes were always returned within 30 minutes!! Speaking with Edna from BS I realize she is sooo blaze that she is used to getting this call. Not worth it! For the hassle and damper on my trip to DC I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before dipping my card. Don't dip with BS!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/04/2012,"My husband and I used Capital bikeshare for the first time last week. We found free street parking but it was far from Smithsonian so whatever we saved from parking we used on bikeshare. The instructions were pretty clear, $7 fee for 24 hours use and to prevent additional charges make sure the bike is returned to the next station within 30 minutes. We found the docking stations easily but a room for improvement is to maybe provide a GPS with the bike to be able to find the closest one. i know they provide maps but it requires time to look and figure out which station is nearest our destination. We just got lucky that when we needed to dock them we found one close to our stop.Will do this again when we go to DC. I hope that in the future they will include trailers so we can bring our kids, that would be a fun activity."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/08/2016,"Totally useless. Most of the times the racks are totally empty or totally full but when they're not, the kiosk is usually down. The customer service is horrific. It's obviously designed to take advantage of tourists. Avoid this and rent a bike from a reputable bike shop."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/13/2016,"Best customer service experience I've ever had. I was calling to get a refund because the code I was given at a bikeshare station didn't work and I was still charged although I was unable to use the bike. I called Capital Bikeshare's customer service line, an actual person answered the phone immediately and within 2 minutes I was given a refund. No automated answering machine, no getting passed around from person to person. Just very efficient and helpful service. Thank you!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,05/07/2016,"I used Bikeshare to get around town to various meetings during a recent visit to DC for work.  It was faster, cheaper, and more fun than taxis (I used it four times during my visit, paying $8 total), and more convenient than the Metro because I needed to get to places that weren't near stations.   The pricing makes sense for this kind of use.  What isn't up to snuff is the infrastructure. The touch screens are slow and finicky at best, and I routinely had to swipe my credit card several times before the system would recognize it.  As other commenters have noted, customer service is non-existent.  I give the system four stars because it met my needs perfectly, but there's lots of room for improvement."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,11/08/2014,"Love it as a tourist. Bikes are like a 98 accord, theyre unstoppable, ugly tanks. Lots of availability downtown and conveniently located. I like the rental fee structure too. Definitely recommend it for getting around down here"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/25/2014,"Awesome way to view the monuments.  Navigating around the people can be a bit annoying, but much better than tired feet at the end of the day.  The cost of the bike rental...a bit confusing, and the $101 holding fee per bike....sucks, but I understand the liability risk in lending the bikes.  When first renting the bike it sounds like you can rent the bike for 90 minutes for $8.  Then you see something that says a day pass for $7.  After that you have the first 30 minutes to use the bike with no additional charge...then it's $8 per hour after that.  You are encouraged to park and go along the way so you can forgo some additional charges.  We just rode our bikes for about 2.5 hours nonstop and it worked out for us.  I will definitely consider using this form of transportation next time I'm in town showing guest around."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/09/2014,We r out-of-owners and rented bikes here to tour around dc for an afternoon. Things were exactly as advertised. bikes were in great shape. only neg comment would be that we did not have helmets; it would be good if they could find a way to rent those as well.
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/21/2011,"Pricing model is misleading -- I would argue intentionally. Be sure you read the fine print before you rent.I used CaBi of couple of times in DC, noting the advertised membership prices for hourly, daily, yearly rates. Seemed like a deal at the time, so I paid $5 for a time-stamped 24 hour period. I was notified by the kiosk that a $101 hold would be placed on my card until the bike was returned, but that was it. I found out different when I got my credit card statement. Apparently, $5 is only for the 'privilege' of using the bike itself, then you get dinged a fee for each 1/2 hour of use.  Several of my colleagues were also duped. So, three rentals ended up being and additional $60-70 dollars for a couple afternoon rides. That kind of money could have paid for several cab rides with money left over for lunch.C'mon guys. I know the economy is tough, but duping people into paying more by intentionally misleading them on the purchase price is a low blow. As others have noted, this is a great way get exercise and it's emission free. We need more of these options in larger cities. Don't alienate people with bad business tactics before you've really had a chance to grow."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/19/2014,I rented a bike for one day for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised! It was easy to ride around ( I mostly rode around the national mall and monuments) but it was much better than walking all day. I'm glad it had a bell because some people are clueless when you're trying to get past them!The only problem I had was that I wanted to ride to a museum but the closest dock was filled so I couldn't ride it there. I guess I could have just waited for someone to take one out but that seemed time inefficient. It was kind or annoying to have to get out my credit card each time I wanted a bike but I guess that's the only way to do it without having a yearly membership.All in all I really liked renting a bike for a day. If you do it you have to get the app. I would have wasted so much time trying to find open docks if I didn't have the app so that's definitely a lifesaver.I think it's definitely worth a try for a day it was nice.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/22/2015,"My boyfriend and I visited DC for a few days, walking around to all the sights, but only managed to use the bike share once, which was a mistake on our part. When we visited the weather was pretty chilly, but I had my mind set to walk around the Tidal Basin. Enter Capital Bikeshare! We found a station near the Smithsonian Metro, followed the prompted directions, and we were on our way. While visiting the monuments around the Tidal Basin we were hesitant to leave our bikes unattended (they charge $1000 for a replacement!) so we ended up walking them around while visiting the MLK and FDR monuments. We got a few dirty looks from tourists, but we didn't care, it wasn't worth the risk of leaving them on the trail. When we approached the Jefferson Memorial there was a bike station available, so we turned our bikes in, did our thing at the monument, and checked out bikes again for the ride back! They charge per time usage, but the fees are pretty minimal when you compare it to the time you are saving and the time spent off your feet!Easy!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/02/2014,These bike share rental systems are the best thing ever.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/17/2012,"Not good ,not good.I've first time been d.c.I rent one bicycle form Capitial Bike Share.And they give me a receipt for 7 dollar daily.But couple days later, they charged me 61.00(totally charge for 4hours and 2min) and 101.00 security deposit(it will give me back).I am so angry.  They didn't show the price to anyone by their station.So don't rent their bike without their membership.they will charge unbelievable price from u not fat pocket."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/16/2011,"I love you Capital Bikeshare!  You're the one thing in DC that I'm really impressed with.  I wish I'd have joined sooner.Why?1.  You've got a station right outside my apartment and seemingly, in every other location I frequent.2.  You save me money, this is even cheaper than the metro or buying my own bike.3.  You help the environment.4.  I get a work out when I don't even realize it.5.  I was robbed while walking on the sidewalk a week ago, but I doubt that will happen again now that I'm zooming down the street! Ha!6.  The bikes are comfy and riding is just as fun as it was when I was 10 years oldTIPS: 1.  Try it for just one day, it will only cost you $5.  I was reluctant to try because I thought I hated riding bikes because all the other bikes I've ever ridden were always so damn uncomfortable.  2.  Actually, unless you live far away from a station and/or you are grossly out of shape, and I mean unable to walk up a flight of stairs you should just go out and get the one year membership.  It is only $75 dollars, you spend that kind of money on a Saturday night out with friends.  3.  The haters who are pissed about their extra charges aren't the sharpest tools in their respective sheds.  In order to keep this from happening just stop by a station every 30 minutes.  Dock the bike and check the same one out two seconds later for no extra fees then continue on your merry way.  It is pathetically easy."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/12/2013,"BEWARE!!!! They charge a $101 deposit on your card per bike rented. So if you travel with debit cards instead of credit cards and have a specific amount budgeted for your trip, you WILL have a hold that will screw up the rest of your trip."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/08/2015,"If I could give 0 stars I would.  My wife and I rented bikes from the Bikeshare. The kiosk you rent them from is horribly misleading. It explains the rates for renting of the bikes. On the kiosk it states $8 for a 24 hour membership. To anyone reading that, it would read $8 to rent for 24 hours. I rented 2 bikes and my wife and I rode them for under 3 hours each. Upon coming home, I checked my bank account and noticed a $16 charge and a $60 charge. When I called the company, they explained that the $8 was just to ""take the bikes"" and we couldn't use them for more than 30 minutes at a time. If we went over 30 minutes, there was ""overage charges"". When you rent them at the kiosk, there is a 233 page terms and conditions and the person I spoke with on the phone told me it explained the charges in there. My wife and I would have never rented the bikes had we known it would be nearly $100 for 3 hours. If the kiosks were better labeled, other customers would not have to be mislead in the future."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/20/2011,"My husband and I joined the capital bikeshare program back when it first appeared as smartbike, and it's been amazing, both for commuting around as residents of the city and for signt-seeing when we have guests.First, as a resident, you pay a low annual fee, and then you can take a bike from any station to any other station though out the year. You never get charged anything additional unless you take a bike for longer than 30 minutes - I've never needed to do this commuting around the city. Now that there are so many stations and so many streets have bike lanes, biking is often the fastest way to get around the city - I often imagine I can feel the evil eye from all the cars backed up in traffic when I fly down the bike lane during rush hour.For tourists, the bikes are also great. It's $5 for a one-day rental, or $15 for 5 days. After you pay that small fee, you can use the bikes just like a local. If you have a hotel up by Dupont Circle, grab a bike and the trip to the National Mall becomes a fun and quick coast downhill that lets you see more of the city and avoid taking the metro. We recently had family visiting who wanted to see some of the farther-away monuments - the Jefferson Memorial, Arlington Cemetery, and the Iwo Jima Memorial. This is a beautiful loop to do on a bike, with really beautiful trails along the river. My husband and I used our memberships, and our relatives bought one-day bike memberships. To avoid high usage fees, we made sure to stop at the bike racks along our route and check the bikes in every so often. (Prices go up the longer you have the bikes, but every time you check them in, your usage time goes back to zero, even if you just take the same bike right back out again.) We could have also opted to just pay the $20 or so in usage fees to keep the bikes, but since there are so many bike racks around DC and Arlington, VA, it didn't take us much time to check them in.(And to people who are giving low ratings because of the pricing system - it's written right on the machine where you put in your credit card - I'm not sure how they could make it more transparent...)"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/13/2011,"I've used bike share a couple of times now.  I thought some of the issues would be resolved after the program was up and running - like a restaurant staff that needs some time to work out kinks.  Today it seemed whatever could go wrong did.It's a 5 minute walk from my house to the bike stand on 14th. Perfect.One bike left, it's being worked on by technicians. Seems that the latch mechanism is not working properly and it wasn't locking to the station. They fix it and tell me it's fine. Away I go.Three docking stations I visited looking to park around 19th and L were full.  Called the 800 number and they found me a place to lock up but it's 6 blocks away. By this time I was 30 minutes late for the doctor. So after my appointment I go to get a new bike to ride to my office, but it says I already have a bike out and it won't give me a new one.Called 800 number. On hold for about 10 minutes, then it took them another 5  minutes to confirm that they had the bike and I was ok, and they would reset my credit card so I could take out another bike. Turns out, that locking mechanism never locked properly. By that time though I was dangerously close to late for an international call I had to be on, so I had hailed a cab.Told them I wasn't pleased and they apologized but offered no credit, no nothing.Bottom line - the system is ok unless you're up against a tight time squeeze.  I would not describe it as more reliable than Metro.  If your day requires you to actually be somewhere on time, skip the bike or use your own."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/23/2014,On Sunday I and my wife used this service for the first time. We rented two bikes and delivered them back less than 30 minutes later. However my credit card statement says I've been charged an extra fee of US$ 202. Is there any reason for that?
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/12/2011,"I love Capital Bikeshare! Just got a $75/yr membership and it is awesome! After doing some cost-benefit analysis, I figured Capital Bikeshare is more than worth it because it 1) Saves Money ($104/MONTH for the Metro vs. $75/YEAR for CaBi) 2) Time (I can go whenever I want, no traffic jams, don't have to wait 18 minutes for the next train or 30 min for the next bus), CaBi is also 24/7 whereas the Metro closes at midnight or 2 am3) Provides Good Exercise4) Environmentally Friendly5) Great way to explore DCHere's the pricing for memberships:24-hour $55-day $1530-day $25Annual $75Pricing for usage fees:0-30 minutes FREE31-60 minutes +$1.5061-90 minutes +$3.00Each additional 30 minutes +$6.00*Since there are so many CaBi stations all across DC and NoVa, it's possible to always have a free trip: just dock your Bike at a nearby station as your 30 minutes are about to run out, then take out the same Bike and go ahead on your journey. But most places in DC will take less than 30 minutes to get to. I have a Blackberry and the Mobile Spotcycle App could be improved (please include a MAP!) but it's alright for now because at least it has the names of the intersections. I'm really glad CaBi is expanding, I can't wait to see all the new stations! CaBi is pretty much already at all the metro stations, but it would be great to see them expand even further. Thanks Capital Bikeshare!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,01/02/2012,"Capital Bikeshare is great. It has changed the way I get around the district. I still take bus and metro, especially when I am carrying loads of stuff, but for a quick trip, CaBi is the way to go. I ride several times a week and I have yet to receive a charge beyond the initial membership fee, as I keep all my rides under 30 minutes. That's all it takes to get to most places inside the district. If you want to go siteseeing, there are a number of bike rental places who offer day-long rentals. I also love that you can go online and see how far you biked and how many calories you burned. Although there were some glitches initially, busy stations have been expanded and new ones are being added. I plan to continue my membership through next year. Go CaBi!"
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,11/22/2014,"As a tourist I used the 24 hour option for $7.  I had 2 major problems.  1) When I chose to have the code printed, the slip got stuck in the printer. Stupidly it didn't also display on the screen, and there is no way to ask it to do so when the printer fails. I got lucky when I asked for an account report to be printed. When I did that, the code came out (first). Whew.   2) I tried to use bike share again after 23.5 hours but the code failed. So warning! You do NOT get 24 hours, you get some unknown about less than 24. I was screwed since I really needed that bike and didn't expect the code to be rejected well before the 24 hour mark.  Other than those problems, the system is great. Lots of convenient stations with bikes and some open slots - and the bikes were in good condition."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/07/2014,"Can I give zero stars? I don't know who is running this show but he/ she needs help. This is a service that the DMV area definitely needs but this company is screwing it up by the numbers. The fragile, poorly made ""key"" they issued broke after about 3 months. Apparently this is a super common problem, to the point they had to switch vendors. When I called to inquire I was advised their ""system was down"" and to call again in a week. I called a week later and got same routine. Called back again and I was told in no uncertain terms that the key was being shipped. 2 weeks later I called when no key had arrived. The rep said no order was placed for the key. Lie #1. Speaking w her manager, bill Robbins, I was again assured it would be in my mail box in 10 days and they were putting it in the mail immediately. 3 weeks later I called back when no key had arrived and was told that my key was on back order. The rep said that when in last spoke with the other rep they had just received a shipment but my request wasn't covered bc of the enormous back log. Lies #2 and #3. Speaking w the manager, Deric McKinney, he assured me that this would be sent to someone/some department that could get me an answer as to when my key would be available to me. He said they are very good about it and I should hear from them in 48 hrs. It's now 8 days later. No word from capitol bikeshare. Lie #4. I understand that this is a new venture (kind of, minus boston, New York, Chicago, etc) but there is no excuse for this level of incompetence. If they can't get the keys made fast enough, fine, things happen. Big you cannot lie to customers over and over again w a smile. Or can you? They are really the only game in town. I have no real recourse. I am calling once more and then I'll be going to BBB. But that will just be on principle. There is nothing really to be gained. If you have the resources and space buy a bike."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/26/2011,COOKS! SCAM!!!! ROBBERY!  they charged me $92 for 1 day! Pricing guide very unclear make sure you read all the fine print.  PRICING VERY MISLEADING
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/18/2014,This is a phenomenal service (for annual members) with great locations and in my experience phenomenal/responsive customer service.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/14/2014,ITS NOT $7 rental for the day.Its $7 for stupid membership fee and free for first 30 minutes.After 30 minutes its $$$$ every half hour or 1 hour.So you end up paying $7 + usage/hour + etc.I ended up paying $58 for 2 bikes for 2.5 hours which i assumed will cost only $14 for me. Its almost costly as renting a car.Its a rip off.Take your own bikes.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/05/2015,"Horrible deceiving pricing. They charged me $56 for 3.5 hour trip. I have never imagined it can be this expensive. Stay away. When I called, they said since it is your first time use we can credit you $23, but still you cannot take this bikes for a measure stroll and I am not a tourist: I live in DC."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,11/29/2011,"Ok, so the bikes aren't perfect, but they are good enough for a fun ride around the NOVA/DC area. The perks are that they are conviently located, are 3 speed and have an adjustable seats. The negative aspects are they do not have adjustable handle bars, have large tires and do not have much grip on cement."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/25/2011,"LOVE Bikeshare. I was one of the 4687540723 people to pick up the deal when LivingSocial offered it and have only been inconvenienced a few times. I've rolled up to a couple full stations and have had to double back to further off docks (one up a pretty brutal hill) and last night my key inexplicably wouldn't unlock any of the bikes at Dupont Circle so I had to take another short hike to another dock. Really, a small price to pay.If you've got an Android powered phone, download Spotcycle. It's a nifty app that will locate the nearest stations and let you know how many bikes or spots are currently available. Boom, now I don't have to worry about riding up to a full station again.I wish the time limit before you have to pay was a wee bit longer so I wouldn't be pouring sweat as I bike across the city to work in the morning in an effort to keep my ride under the half hour mark, but that's just me being a complainer. Bikeshare is saving me a ton of money on metro costs and ensures I don't have to sit around waiting for a bus after last call when I go out. Also, you should check out my quads. They're getting pretty beastly. Thanks Capital Bikeshare!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/12/2011,I just signed up this morning after receiving my key and was so excited...only to find out that at around 8.30am when I was going to bike to work that THERE WERE NO BIKES AVAILABLE anywhere in Columbia heights or nearby stations...I mean what the hell!! Why would they have so many people sign up without having enough bikes available. So I was late to work.My first day experience has not been good and off course I have lotsta day in my 30 day membership without being able to use a bike to get to work.I think Capital bikeshare is a great idea and initiative but if it isn't dependable then whats the point!!Oh then I called them and was put on hold for ages...so had to leave a message!!!Not a happy customer...who knows maybe tomorrow I'll get a bike...but will keep my metro card with me just incase!!!!!
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,11/20/2014,"More than happy with this service. There is room for improvement, but they are doing their best and adapting. 24 hour call service and cans driving and relieving full docks all the time. It is nice to ride to work and all. As with everything in DC, you have to think outside the box, and leave early or late to beat the rush, or perhaps it is not for you. They are constantly expanding and adding more docks and bikes, so it is a great alternative to public transit or even riding your own bike. I'll be renewing my membership next year."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/08/2014,"Used the bikeshare on a vacation to Washington DC last week.  Got two three-day passes so that my husband and I could explore the sites.  On a three day trip, using the bikes two or three times per day, I got three different bikes that were mechanically defective.  As per the instructions, I found another station and checked the bikes in, pushing the maintenance needed button.  Annoying.Once I checked my credit card statement, I found out that we were charged $20 in fees on a $30 rental cost due to time going over the 30 minutes.  Having read the website on my phone, I had been counting on the pricing structure for overages that is included in the text.  Evidently, if you scroll further down, there is a much more expensive overage fee structure for certain types of rentals, including the 3-day that I used.  After almost 30 minutes on the phone with customer service, I finally insisted that the representative send me an itemized statement.  Evidently you can rack up $20 in fees for going over by 3 or 5 or 7 minutes on a few different trips.  I really don't have any desire to spend my vacation with a stop watch out to make sure that I don't go over some arbitrary time limit.  And having a fee that is 2/3 of the whole initial rental cost is nuts.  Plus, the fact that I experienced so many maintenance issues is evidently irrelevant.  The customer service lady told me that if I had called them, I could have gotten credited for my issues.  I informed her that I followed the instructions which stated to push the maintenance button.  Apparently, that doesn't count.Between faulty bikes (not to mention ridiculously heavy and only having 3 gears, making them incredibly slow) and the crazy fees for time overages, I will not be using a bike share again.  I'd rather just deal with the hassle of bringing my own bike and know that I can ride a mechanically sound bike and actually enjoy myself."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/25/2014,"This is my new favorite thing in DC.  I moved back here 3 months ago after being away for 10 years, and wanted to re-learn the city, especially since it has changed so dramatically since I last lived here.  After renting a bike for a day, I bought an annual membership.  It has been great!!   These bikes are everywhere and I literally have ridden ALL over town.  It makes me appreciate DC much more, now that I realize how many cool neighborhoods there are, including many that did not exist 10 years ago!  DC has changed SO much, and these bikes have helped me see the city, much better than walking or driving.  (It helps that most of the DC hills are pretty gentle)."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,11/08/2011,"AWESOME idea, GREAT webservice (they list your miles biked, calories burned) ... and I'm proud it's in my city. The only reason for the middling rating is because they still have a fair amount of work to do to smooth out the demand and supply logistics. We've stopped taking it because we can't be sure there will be an open dock at the other side, and it's not uncommon to have to spend an additional 20 minutes or more just circling around various stations, requesting more time and looking for an opening. This makes trip planning difficult, and we just tend to go for the safer alternative of the bus or car these days. :(   I know it's not an easy problem, but please find a way to fix this Capital Bikeshare, and we'll come back and be loyal customers!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/12/2015,"Kiosk barely functioned, bikes were too heavy for me to use comfortably, and as a fairly petite female I couldn't put my feet on the ground with the bike seat in its lowest position. What a waste. Haven't even looked at our credit card to see what the kiosk charged for this debacle, but I'm not optimistic after reading the other posts below. Better things to do with a beautiful weekend. Save yourself the hassle."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/12/2013,"I love it and love that they are always expanding! If you live or work in the city it really is faster to bike then metro or bus to many locations. It's not a total transportation solution for all situations, but it is for many. No I will not bike back from a big grocery trip or visiting relatives in the outer burbs, but what a great and fun way to get home from work! Yes I'm still terrified of being mauled by traffic but DC has gotten a lot better about bike lines, and if you know your route can also use back streets. Also most of the stops are close enough that if they are out of bikes, or full and you need to drop it back off can just look on the map and hit the next one. I love it, best 75 dollars spent for the year membership ever. But for cereal,  where a damn helmet and only use the sidewalks if you really, really have to. * shakes fist like the grumpy old man he is."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/13/2011,"Amazing. Why every city does not have this, I don't know. Rent it for 24 hours for chump change, and only pay for the time you use it. SIMPLE.One heads up, sometimes there may not be bikes left by the time you figure out to pay with the machine, have someone stand next to the bike you want, to sort of ""hold"" your bike while you rent it at the machine."

DC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/16/2015,"After my experience with bike share in Philly, this was very disappointing.  In Philly, I inserted my card, chose one time use, and was on my bike 1 minute and $4 later.  Capital Bikeshare has terrible touchscreens that are hard to read (if they are working at all) and not enough locations.  The result was my husband and I walking around for 20 minutes trying to find a station with a functioning screen and two functional bikes.  After visiting 3 stations we finally gave up and walked.  (I know that you can check online for the amount of bikes in the station, but one of the bikes listed as available was broken and at another station a whole group took all of them at once.) The bikes are great, lightweight and easily adjustable. There should be way more stations around the national mall."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/09/2015,"We decided to try out the Capital Bikeshare program on a whim during a quick trip to DC this past weekend. We thought it was a great deal to be able to rent a bike for 24 hours for just $8. It seemed pretty straight forward until, as others have noted, we found a huge fee on our credit card. I read the info on their website and saw that it explained the fees after the first 30 minutes, but this info was not transparently displayed at the docks. Given that these bikes are partially marketed for tourists, I would think they'd do a better job of explaining the fee system on the actual docking stations. We didn't have computers over the weekend and weren't able to read more about how the bikes worked. We saw later that the ticket said we would incur a fee, but we didn't realize the fee would be so huge. The bikes themselves were well maintained and easy to use, but our experience was soured by what I've described above. I hope the Bikeshare program can create better signage to make it clear that the costs increase exponentially after the first 30 minutes."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/01/2013,"I had a year long membership and it was not a pleasant experience.  When I needed a bike, most of the time the docks were empty.  When I need to drop off a bike, the docks were full.  Keep in mind if there are not available docks, then you are expected to house the bike over night and then wait for the pick up truck.  Yes, when you pay for this service you get to work for Cap Bike share.  Methinks not."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/28/2010,"ok so this probably makes me a huge ditz, but I am hoping I'm not the only hopeful Bikesharer who misunderstood this system. Directions on the renting station were unclear and I bought a 5$ daily membership--sounds great, right? $5 to use the bike for a day...daily membership. I rode the bike to work, worked all Saturday, and then returned it, decently happy with the arrangement, even though the bike is a bit heavy and can be unwieldy at times. I like the concept and I appreciate the placement....Only to be charged a $101 deposit fee on my debit card (which I knew about and understood would happen/be returned to me) and then on TOP of that $75.00 for renting the bike all day! What about my $5 daily membership?Well, apparently the daily membership is a misnomer and means you can only use it for under half hour increments throughout the day, taking it out and returning it before it reaches the half hour point. Who does that?Anyway, probs my bad, and they ended up refunding my money after a confused call to customer service, but its made me a bit wary of trying CBS for a while..."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/23/2015,HORRIBLE customer service. This would not be such a big issue if there weren't such constant problems with bike stations and bikes.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,11/19/2010,"The mobile app ""SpotCycle"" now supports Capital Bikeshare! Use your smart phone to see live updates of the locations of nearby bike docks and how many available bikes/open spots at each one. Perfect!Special yearly membership rates are now gone ($50/year) and up to $75 a year, but still worth it."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/07/2013,"We were in town for almost 3 weeks and used the bikes a lot. We purchased the 3 day pass mostly (wish they had weekly instantly), but soon found out that you need to return the bike within 30 minutes before you start incurring additional charges. I didn't feel the need to drop the bike off at every monument and preferred to keep the bike I had, but apparently that isn't ""SHARING."" I downloaded the app to see how many bikes are available at each station but on a couple occasions, the station said it had 3 or 4 but come to find that they all had tags for repairs or there weren't any bikes. We would then have to walk in a complete opposite direction or just take the metro. There was also a time that the rack was full to drop the bike off. The bikes were clean and easy to use. The different gears came in handy for the uphill battles. Overall, I love the concept and if I was using it to run errands, it would be great, but not for long term use for joy rides around town."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/21/2011,"How did I live before bike share???? I think I've saved more money by not taking taxis, burned more extra calories, and generally have seen more of NW thanks to bike share! I've only had two instances where I couldn't dock my bike for some time, but I'm sure they are working on this problem! It's an excellent veture, and an amazing model in urban sustainable transportation! I hope it spreads, like a red 3-speed virus, across the US and world!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/29/2013,"Went for a one day tour of DC. Without these handy bike stations, it would have been futile and we would have been more tired than we ended up. We ended up using stations on H Street, Union Station, near the Washington Monument, near the Lincoln Monument, Rosslyn, and Georgetown. They are SUPER heavy but extremely handy. We had a blast!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/24/2015,The pricing is VERY deceptive.  They advertise $8 per 24 hours but will charge you an additional $22 unless you return the bike every 30 minutes -- or something.  I'm not even sure what the pricing is after looking at the website.  Anyways caveat emptor.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/14/2015,What's the use when the bikes are never where you need them? The docks by my home are empty by 7:30 in the morning. The docks by my job are always full. This is not a practical way of commuting if capital bikeshare doesn't move more bikes around. For the price of membership (which seems pretty high to me) they should try a little harder to keep the stations half full/half empty so you don't have to scramble looking for a nearby station with docks.
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,05/04/2011,"I'm a MtP resident, and I finally activated my key from the Living Social deal this week.  I took my first bike ride yesterday....make that 4 bike rides, and I really loved it.  Took a ride from MtP down near the White House, down to the mall and around the monuments, and had a chance to test out the bike on all different surfaces, and it did well.  The bike is a bit heavy, so you may want to consider that before you try popping the front wheel onto a curb...and well, as a guy it was a bit strange not having a higher crossbar on the bike, because I didn't realize how often I used that to ""kick"" the rear end of a bike in a different direction when stopped.But all in all, I loved it.  I was riding mid-week from 7:30 to 9:30, and didn't really have any issues with stations being too full or too empty, and thus didn't feel very guilty when I checked in a bike, and then almost immediately took out another bike.The climb back up to MtP takes a bit of effort, but I'm hoping that also means that I'll often find an empty dock when I bring a bike back to the 'hood.  Yay Bikeshare!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/04/2010,"Haven't ridden a bike in, oh about, 15 years. But as a couple of my friends have recently bought bikes and I am on a new fitness plan, I decided to give the Capital BikeShare program a whirl to ride around the city and Rock Creek Park.Was a little nervous that the bike (which looked pretty sturdy) would be too heavy or very dork-ish. It took a second to get comfortable since its been so long since I've ridden but sooner than expected I was ready to tackle the bike paths in the street.I was happily surprised that the machines were so easy to use. It literally walks you through the steps of signing up for a daily membership. You pay your $5 (and they hold a deposit of $101 incase you damage or don't return your bike) and otherwise you pay a nominal fee for each 30 min increment. The first half hour is free.As for feeling like a dork, I didn't. Especially since I encountered several other riders with Capital Bikeshare bikes, all who either at least smiled and acknowledged me or even stopped to give information on good places to ride or their experiences with the program.The bike worked out just fine, the new bike paths throughuout the city made me feel comfortable riding and I passed at least 2 other racks where I could return my bike during my route.The only suggestion I have is that the website make it a little easier to find where the locations are. It would be great if you could type in a part of town and it showed all the Capital Bikeshare sites, instead of looking at one huge map of the city and having to figure it out.If you want a new form of exercise, need to run a quick errand or want to explore DC but don't own a bike, this is a great way to go."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/05/2011,"I've had a membership with Capital Bikeshare for about a year, and I'm very satisfied with my membership.  Though I may not use it enough to completely justify the $75 membership fee, having it as another transportation option has been a huge help and a great money-saver.  I'm sure I would get more use out of it if I had a smartphone.  Unfortunately, I have to check from a computer or the dock site itself ahead of time to make sure bikes are available at my check out spot and at my planned dock spot.  I find the locations to be convenient to where I'm departing and where I'd like to go.  I've only been dock-blocked once, though it immediately started pouring and I had a ride in the rain and a long walk back to my house in the pouring rain, I don't hold it against CaBi.The two things I wish they'd improve is to find a way to lock helmets to the bikes so you can check those out as well.  Also, if they could put some sort of lock on it so that you can temporarily lock it somewhere while you run inside on an errand, that would be enormously helpful.  I've started carrying around a cheap lock so I can lock the bike up while I run inside on a quick errand."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/11/2016,horrible horrrrrrrrible service. they say you have a 24 hour membership and then charge you for ever hour after 30 minutes. even worse customer service.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/25/2011,"Good for the environment and your health and easy on your wallet. Super convenient. The bikes are easy to ride from the street to gravel paths on the National Mall.  My husband uses CaBi to commute to work - from Logan Circle to Chinatown area - in a quarter of the time. I ride for fun - to Dupont, Georgetown, Eastern Market. Three tips:- Before you head to a station to pick up a bike, check the website to ensure there are bikes there, particularly during rush hour. There's an app for that. - Make sure to dock the bike 30 minutes after you check it out - otherwise it will start charging you. The $5 daily pass works all day, you just have to ""check in"" to a bike station within every 30 minutes. See the website for all pricing details.- BYOH. Bring your own helmet (if your head is worth protecting."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/10/2012,"The pricing model is very misleading.  As a first time user, it appeared to me that the cost was $7 for a 24 hour period.  Took the bike out for a nice 3 hour ride.  Next day find out I have a $45 charge AND a $202 charge on my card.  First I thought I had not placed the bike back properly and it had been stolen or something.  Then I call to inquire about it and apparently the $202 is a deposit (which I was unaware I would be charged for).  They said that would be refunded to my card in a week's time.  I'm glad I didn't use my debit card at least.   The $45 was apparently for the usage of the bike for over 3 hours (I was at 3:05).Anyway, I thought the whole bikeshare idea sounded great, and maybe it is better for folks who buy an annual membership, but their prices for taking one out for a day apparently are completely ridiculous, and the kiosk is misleading with it's pricing.For 3 uses of their bikes, I could buy my own bike."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/06/2013,"Great idea, and all the bikes I rode worked fine, but there were many, many stations that were out of bikes.  They need to do a better job of moving the bikes around so that the stations in the middle of the city have bikes.  Still, if you are here for a few days and like riding bikes at all you really should get the 3 day pass for only $15 and you will be amazed how much you can see."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/28/2013,"We use bike share every time we are in the DC area, absolutely great.  Easy, economical, comfortable, tons of locations, and the little bell is great too!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/28/2014,I would have given 0 stars if allowed. Never use this service if you want to catch a train at Union Station. They can't seem to find a way to keep spots open anywhere near the station. Makes the rental absolutely useless if you have to park the bike a mile away and walk back again. Just horrible.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/09/2011,"Amazingly convenient service. Provided you pay attention to how the rates work (and it isn't hard) this is a very cheap and easy way to get around town, even for tourists, especially for tourists. $5 to rent a bike for a 24 hour period, unlimited uses that day for free, provided the bike isn't kept out for more than 30-minutes. You can pretty much get anywhere you'd want in half an hour, and as long as you plan a little bit ahead so you know where you need to drop the bike off in relation to where you are going, it is very easy to get around on the cheap!"
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/25/2015,"Good in theory. Capital Bikeshare is only good if you plan on making short trips to a nearby metro station. You get charged outrageous overage fees is you use it for more than 30 minutes at a time. Also, the bikes are big and bulky. Considering how expensive this service is I would expect better bikes. Furthermore, the customer service could care less about their ripoff practices."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/17/2014,"The system is great for tourists like myself. I visited Washington for a day and riding the bikes around all the monuments was fun (haven't rode a bike since I was a kid). But what really made me give it 1 star was the holding in my account. I rented 2 bikes so I now have a $202 hold in my account, when I called I was told that they'll release the money from 5-10 business days. Who the hell has $100 or more to spare from 5-10 days?! This situation has created an economic problem in my life because of this nonsense. People beware, if you are willing to have from $101-$202 stuck in limbo for 5-10 business days then go ahead. Otherwise, stay away from this company."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,04/20/2015,"WARNING - if you don't return your bike every 30min they charge you another $7 - doesn't matter if the slots are all full. Customer service only knows how to read out of a manual and isn't much help! I love the idea, but it needs a lot of help."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/18/2013,"We love our capital bikeshare membership, but we've noticed an increasingly high number of dock blocks or empty racks. Extremely frustrating when you're trying to get somewhere and when time over a half hour is $$$. Suggest keeping more metrics on empty/full docks and times."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/09/2011,"Did DC in a day, literally, and couldn't have gotten my tourist fix in without these bikes.  The fiancé and I took the bikes all over the DC area.  They were easy to use and placed in convenient locations.  Any tourist looking for helpful transportation (besides the Metro) should try these bikes out.  Tip: the bikes do not come with locks so if you want to leave it outside while touring one of the museums, bring locks.  Other than that it's great way to tour DC!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/18/2011,"Wonderful program!Good:-Handy Smartphone app named Spotcycle-Good number of stations in DC-Bikes have three gears, adjustable seat, and front & rear lightsBad:-Limited stations west of Rosslyn (e.g. Court House and Clarendon)-30 minutes go quick, especially when using for exercise-Some difficulty with some stations having available bikes or available docks, but this has gotten markedly better in the last couple months-The map on their website and on the app list bike stations, but could be clearer on which direction they go (DC streets often only have one bike lane that goes one direction)Future: (Looking bright!)-More stations across DC and MD-Expanding stations to Northern Virginia along Wilson Blvd-HOPEFULLY more bike lanes"
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/10/2012,"Used Capital Bike share for the first time last week. A friend and I had some free time before the Nats game and decided to bike around the city after seeing their website. Now, we had read the fine print about the prices and fees and knew it would be a tad pricey, but we were ok with that (cheaper than drinking and eating at a bar all afternoon, plus the exercise!). We biked for about 3 hours and covered about 8miles around the city and loved that we could dock our bikes right outside the stadium before the game. What I *WAS* annoyed with is I never saw anything about the $101 hold they put on their card. (Yes, I did read their website and the pricing guides at the docking station. Maybe I missed it, but it would have been VERY tiny print as I read everything when trying something new).Also, the next day, I emailed the company and told them what a great time my friend and I had - basically what I said above in the first paragraph - just gave them and their service a glowing review and said we'd most defaintly be back. What was SHOCKING was I received a reply email, that yes, stating how grateful they were for the nice review, but...and then went on a very very long rant about how we didn't understand the purpose of their service and how they weren't meant for recreational rides and how we'd be charge for the 3 hours and blah blah blah. (Again, my friend and I had calculated the amount it would cost us and we were FINE with the price. We were in no way disputing that). I just found it rude that after trying to give them praise, I was informed I didn't understand their company and used it for the wrong purpose. (Again, please show me on their website were it says their service is ONLY for commuting and not intended for recreational biking around the city). If they want it only to be for getting from Place A to Place B, they should only allow the bikes to be out 30-60 minutes AT THE MOST, to prevent senic biking. I love the idea of biking around the city, but I'll be researching other companies the next time I do this."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/14/2011,"Ask, and you shall receive!  The day after my last review - and every day since - CaBi shuttles have been moving bikes during rush hour to keep bikes available where they're needed, and docks available on the opposite end.  In response to other members and by monitoring demand at various stations, they've been installing additional docks and adding bikes to the system.  Several new stations are slated to open shortly to accommodate the growing membership and better cover the city.  Their staff is friendly and responsive, and it's a wonderful way to get around town!Thank you, Capital Bikeshare!!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,01/01/2013,"We had a lot of fun on the bikes and it was a great way to see the city. The bikes were easy to find, and easy to ride.  I appreciated that they had built-in lights.  The key is to dock your bike every 30 minutes to avoid getting usage fees that add up quickly, and finding an open space could be hard in popular spots.  Download the app to help."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,05/05/2015,"It's great to help me get too and from places fast, and I have an annual membership.  But the service can be either great or terrible depending on who you speak too.   Like tonight I had to call a few times to get help when the dock I was returning my bike to didn't work.   The first woman I spoke to was incredibly rude, but her supervisor was a huge help."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/04/2013,"I wish I could give them zero stars.  They charged me $94 for a 1 hour bike ride.  When I called to complain they told me that I had rented the bike for 8 hours.  Nope.  The best customer service could do for me was credit me back half of the price.  So I paid $47 for a 1 hour ride.  There is no way to get a receipt when you return the bike, and obviously their computer system is seriously flawed.  Unless you have a lot of disposable income, DO NOT rent from them.Total scam and huge rip off."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,11/09/2014,"It is a great option for seeing the monuments as a tourist. The downside is the smoke and mirrors billing! It is clearly advertised that you can rent a bike for $7 a day/24 hours. It is not so clear that if you do not bring the bike back within 30 minutes you are charged overage fees. Suddenly your $7 deal is no longer a deal! Why would I want to have to bring my bike back every 30 minutes while going for a long ride, i.e. touring the monuments? The only upside is my bill was cut in half after calling to complain. Obviously their hope is that you don't check your credit card closely. Shady..."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/10/2011,"I'm giving CaBi five stars because it's great for the very specific way in which I use it: to get to DCA in the wee hours.  When I'm trying to catch a 6AM flight and the first Metro doesn't run through Columbia Heights station until 5:20, I'm stuck with Supershuttle or a cab for $20+... or I can take CaBi for free.  I walk over to Lamont Park to check out a bike, ride down to the Mount Vernon trail, and park in Crystal City.  Then I walk about five minutes into DCA and that's that.  Takes about 45 minutes.(Just a couple of warnings though: I would make sure I know the route to the airport well.  And the LED lights on CaBi obviously weren't meant to light up a dark trail... but it works.)There's not a lot of room to carry luggage, but I travel with a suitbag that I can carry on my back, and sometimes I bring an extra bungee cord to strap small bags to the little front rack since the existing ones are pretty short.  I haven't tried to take a larger bag with me yet, but if I do I'm thinking I might try to affix it to the saddle rails like a big saddlebag.  Overall, a great solution for Metro's early, early morning shortcomings."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/19/2012,"If you're doing a recreational ride--make it short & sweet!My husband & I decided it was a pretty day & we wanted to spend a day outside. We decided to rent the little ""red bikes"". I have been in the DMV area for less than a year & we currently do not own our own bikes, so we saw that Capital Bikeshare had the most docks & that the website actually shows you how many are available at each dock. What the website does not tell you--which I can as being misleading--is the fact that it's $7 for the first 30 mins, but there are additional fees for the extra time & there is a $101 deposit per bike...for us, it wasn't a big deal...we originally planned to go from 10th & constitution to Georgetown, but after we saw the price, we decided to change our ride to around the national mall & see the MLK memorial. We never had intentions on biking all day, so the 1.5 hours was perfect for us & still an inexpensive, fun way to tour DC. Definitely not meant for long rides. Would do it again...We plan to buy bikes but until then, Capital Bikeshare works for us!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/05/2012,"A rental system that doesn't work. If you want to rent a bike more than once a day, you have to deal with their ""technical glitches"" frequently since the codes they generate don't work all the time. Then when you call customer service, they are quick to tell you it is your fault. That you probably didn't enter the code in time - I think I can handle punching in 5 digits in less than 5 minutes. Horrible customer service. A faulty system. Don't use it."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,05/20/2014,"A great concept, but there are still a lot of issues that need to be worked out.  I bought a year membership after the bike seat on my own personal bike was stolen.  Yeah.  Apparently that's a thing now.  Anyway, my plan to bike home from work every day was squashed after I realized that bikes in Tenleytown run out right around 5 p.m. almost every weekday.  So, I have a yearlong bikeshare membership that is pretty much useless.  They often run out of bikes or docks, so it's very unreliable.  The closest docking station is at least 1/2 a mile away from me, and I live in DC.  Everything being said, this is a great option for tourists or people wanting to take a very short, casual bike ride (i.e. not having to worry about timeframes, like having to get to work at a specific time, because you have to factor in the possibility that you might have to take the bike to a further docking station).  If you want to take a ride longer than 30 minutes, just dock your bike and get another and you shouldn't be charged."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/11/2012,"I have been a member of Capital Bikeshare of almost three months now. I loved it at the beginning.  Within a few weeks, I realized that they were unable to address problems being reported, which mainly related to lack of paring spaces in the morning when I needed them.  All four stations near my office were always full.  I called and wrote to them several times, but no improvements were seen.  These days things have become much worse.  In the evening, all the bikes are gone and I cannot find one to ride home.I feel so sad about such a promising idea and promising business.  Their execution is so bad that it does not serve the purpose of those who need the service."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/07/2012,"Love the concept and really enjoyed recent rentals in DC however 2 challenges. First! I could only rent 2 bikes per Visa card. I am glad I happen to have a 2nd Visa or would have been out of luck. The biggest problem is the credit card bill, I have been overcharged on both Visa statements by 6 times the correct amount. Had to dispute with both cc companies.  Poor business model if this is the taste they leave in their users mouth. Watch your credit card statements!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/06/2011,"Although I think there system is pretty good, the customer service reps are complete CROOKS!  I bought a yearly membership thinking I could use it the day I purchased it.  I called before I purchased to make sure this was accurate.  Over the phone they told me that although the yearly membership would not activate for a day or so, I could buy a daily membership and they would just reimburse me.  Great!  So I sign up.  After I received my yearly membership token, I called back customer service and asked them to refund me for the 2 times I used it before I received the token.  They completely balked at refunding me.  The customer service rep even told me that I was a liar!!  What?!?  I asked to speak to his manager, he said OK, then put me on hold for 10 minutes before disconnecting me.  I called back and he kept hanging up on me when he found out who I was.  I couldn't believe it!  I finally called a few hours later and got someone else.  Although the second person was a little nicer (and I stress the word 'little') he still told me that the initial customer service rep I spoke to was misinformed and they would not be reimbursing me.  Again, I asked to speak to a manager and he put me on hold again.  He didn't get me a manager, but said they would review the initial call and get back to me.  A week later, they still hadn't gotten back to me so I called to follow up.  They told me that the first rep I spoke to was misinformed and gave inaccurate information. Eventhough it was their fault for not training their customer service reps properly,  they would not be refunding me.  Essentially telling me ""our bad, but sucks for you"".  So yea, it was only $10 I lost.  But seriously, take responsibilties for your employees.  They have a pretty good rental system, but they are 100% mismanaged and don't know how to conduct themselves in a business atmosphere.  Be wary when contacting them and make sure to always get the name of the person you talked to."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/27/2012,"I am an avid cyclist and recently became an avid Capital Bikeshare supporter. I have the annual membership and I think it's super convenient. The bikes are tanks, they weigh a ton, steer like a boat, and are probably indestructible. The gearing is pretty terrible. I only use gears 1/2 maybe 5% of the time. I often use the bikes to go to and from work. I also will hop on when I see one conveniently located and I'd rather bike than walk. It can be faster than metro and is much healthier!It loses one star because it is DREADFUL when there are too many bikes or too few. I tried biking from Chinatown to Farragut Park on a Friday afternoon and all the stations were at capacity near Farragut. I had to go on a wild chase to find one that wasn't, which added an extra 15 minutes. It's also horrible when you arrive at an empty station. These two problems can't be remedied too much by the company itself, its just one of the problems with a system like this. But, I do wish they'd create larger stations so ease this problem. If every station were 20+ bikes I think it would be better than having multiple small ones in a few block radius. There are tons of stations around DC and VA. They are fairly close and easy to dock/check back in. As an urbanite I love this service and hope they keep expanding!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/10/2014,"I live in Baltimore and am now commuting to Georgetown. I have driven it twice and, after the last time, NEVER again. Basically, the drive is 4 - 5 hours of my life I will never get back. I think I sprouted 10 new grey hairs for each 15 minutes that I was in the drivers seat. So I got me a MARC train pass and a metro card (thanks to the homeless guy who helped me figure this out since metro staff were nowhere to be seen). The metro drops me off either at Dupont which is a 20 minute walk or at Foggy Bottom which is a 15 minute walk. It's been fine and even enjoyable to get a walk in both before and after I spend most of my day with my seat in a chair. But I also spend a lot of time after the MARC train (getting into Union station) getting to my office. I saw a lot of people doing the City Bilkeshare thing while I was walking and figured I would give it a try. So far, except for day 1 where my GPS wasn't working and I saw parts of DC I am almost sure I will never see again, this has been a success. My advice would be to:1) Check out how many bikes and stalls are where you want to start and end up around the times you want to be there. If there are no bikes, or no stalls, I might think twice2) Get the Spotcycle app (I have it on my S3 but thinks it's available for iPhones as well). This allows you to find stands while you are out and about. I searched for Bikeshare and it wasn't clear that this was the app you needed. 3) Have a back up plan. I know that I can always use Metro if I need to. But so far that hasn't been an issue.The process is easy enough. I signed up for a one month membership (which I plan to expand to a year long one since the cost of the month is $25 and the cost of the yearly is $75). I received my ""key"" within a week (sent to my house). The print on the key was small so when I signed in I needed to get my kid to read me the numbers (can you say Mr. Magoo?). I used the key (it's easy to figure out how) the next day. You need to yank the bike out of the stand (and watch out for the pedal), adjust the seat (it helps to remember the height of the seat so you can set it the next time you grab a bike before you start your time), get on and away you go. I didn't bring my helmet the first time (shame on me) or bike gloves but have each other time (I am riding my bike to Penn station and locking it there in the mornings so I have that stuff with me), and was glad I did. People who don't wear helmets don't value their heads.I found four docking stations near to where I work (it really helps to have a few in mind although I have, in three tries not found this to be an issue) and all I did was push the bike in hard, wait for the light and I was done. On the first ride (getting lost) I logged in over 30 min - my fault and I knew I would pay a little over the membership cost. On all subsequent rides I have kept it to under the 30 min mark which means no extra charges.Are the bikes super? No, they are three speeders, but they get the job done. Is this the best program for tourists? No - it only works if you know you can ride for under 30 min, park the bike, do what you need to do and then grab another bike and repeat. If you want to keep a bike all day to see the sights, rent a bike from a shop. Will this work for everyone who commutes? No, but if there are bike stations near where you need to go and you don't mind deal with traffic (some DC streets have nice wide bike lanes and others just sharows) it might make sense. It takes some planning. The cost is such that even if I use it just a few times a week for the month (or less if I get the yearly pass) it is going to pay off in terms of not spending on the metro. And if I can keep at it I might be in better shape. All in all, thumbs up."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/16/2013,"So unlike most people, it seems, I actually read the pricing structure BEFORE I rented.  And knew that if I wanted to use this service it would be for commuter, short trip biking in between things I wanted to do, in less than 30 minutes each trip.I also downloaded - BEFOREHAND - a free app to ""helpfully"" tell me where bikes and docks would be available.In addition, I parked my car in a garage also near me and the starting kiosk that is comparatively fairly inexpensive, but at which you have to commit to prepaying for the number of days you'll be there - there's no ""in and out"" after you park, or you forfeit what you paid up front.  But these bikes are obviously reliable, right?  I see them all over, so they must be...In reality, this was the worst experience I've had in a long time that I got to actually pay for the ""pleasure"" of.It started off well enough.  At the bike rack next to the Washington Hilton there were plenty of bikes, and the kiosk worked perfectly.  Low humidity, unseasonably cool temperatures, yet the sun was shining.  Paradise.  Everything went so smoothly, in fact, that when prompted to pay 7 dollars for one day or 15 for 3, I thought why not I'll go for 3 days.  I've already parked, and this visit I don't want to have a weak moment and hail a cab or take the metro but commit to the health and frugality of bikeshare.  I get the first bike, ride to the West End Cinema, and have just enough time (because I'd also used the Flixster app to check running time, added 10 minutes for trailers, and thus calculated exactly how much time I needed afterward to grab a bike for the return trip and ride back to be on time for where I needed to be afterward - I am nothing if not prepared and organized).So I come out of the movies, check my oh so ""helpful"" bike share app, and see that at the same rack next to the theater there's one bike.  Great.  I only need one.  I swipe the card, get the 5 minute till it expires code for the dock, check.  Walk to the dock, and try to enter the code...  Doesn't work.  The code was 32212 I believe.  The ""3"" button, even if I pressed it very rapidly, sounded like a keyboard key stuck in the down position, and would make a tone audibly much longer than it should.  After the tone would finally end, I would try to press the ""2"" key...  Nothing.  No response at all.  Pressed the ""2"" over and over.  No change.  Finally just to press SOMETHING to maybe jimmy this broken piece of equipment out of its stuck state, I'd press the ""1"", only to get the ""uh oh, you messed up"" tone.  I repeated this process about half a dozen times before finally giving up.  I now realized I was going to be seriously late getting back to where I needed to be.Checked the ""helpful"" app again, and a few blocks away at L and 25th a kiosk had 17 bikes.  Can't go wrong there, right?  I literally race walk, panting and sweating, to the kiosk, while I call ahead to say I'll be late.  I then get to THAT kiosk and...  the entire touchscreen is completely dead!!  Of course there are 17 bikes - no one can get ANY of them!  Does the ""helpful"" app tell you that?  Of course not.  Why alert people of broken docks and touchscreens?  Just tell them there are bikes there, then let them find out they can't actually GET those bikes after they schlep on over.I then go with ""plan C"", hail a taxi, ride in the back of a hot, clangy cab with a surly driver - ah, paradise - and end up after tip paying him 15 MORE dollars.So after paying 15 dollars to ""bikeshare"" (yeah right) as a frugal option for 3 days transportation, thanks to the complete worthlessness of their equipment, after my FIRST 15 minute trip, I get to pay ANOTHER 15 dollars for alternate transportation!  I could have kept my car out of the garage and DRIVEN for less!!  15 dollars for ONE 15 minute trip...  That's a ""bargain"" in someone's world?  At Bike and Roll I can pay a few more dollars for an ENTIRE DAY, and when I come out of something like a movie have that bike waiting for me - right there.  Not 12 blocks away (if I'm lucky enough to get there and find THAT kiosk and/or dock actually works).  At Bike and Roll I also typically pay even less because most of my DC visits are a week or more, and they give you a price break on multiple days.NEVER AGAIN will I waste my time on this ""bikeshare"" nonsense.  And when I'm passing people on these stupid red bikes on the Mount Vernon trail, far from a kiosk, on one of my weekly Bike and Roll bikes (or better yet a completely free bike when I'm staying at a Kimpton hotel), I'll laugh in their faces for being dumb enough to have not checked the pricing structure and instead just go out pedaling around all day long to get hit with those big fees afterwards.  It's obvious only mindless sheep rent these idiotic red bikes, when there are much better alternatives available."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/17/2014,"Not only do I love using their bikes around town, they are also an AMAZING group of people who provide outstanding customer service. I am truly happy to be a member of such a stand-up service! Thank you!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/04/2011,"Having lived around here my whole life I've seen DC go from a hellhole to one of the best cities in North America. Capital Bikeshare is just the icing on the cake. I'm not a member, just use the $5 daily option when I don't have my bike with me. Despite the protestations from a few reviewers below, there is no scam here. If you keep a bike out less than a half hour there is NO charge. You could technically keep the same bike out all day as long as you locked it back into a station dock every 30 minutes, and got a new code from the machine. The bikes are nothing to write home about, although they seem quite sturdy. They are 3 speeds, with bell, lights and a basket. They are heavy, and I wouldn't use it if I was going to go cruise Beach Drive on a weekend, but for Point A to Point B city riding they are perfect. I would highly recommend you get the Spotcycle app for your phone if you're planning a day of Cap BikeShare. The app updates in realtime and lets you know how many bikes and available docks are at each station. It also has list and map views of all stations."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/02/2014,"I've seen these in other cities but tried it for the first time in DC while on vacation with the family. What a great way to get around! Biking is the ideal transportation in DC since the sites are pretty spread out and it's relatively flat. We had a trouble a few times where there weren't enough bikes or docks for our group of 4 but we managed. Also, 30 min goes by faster than you think so we went over a few times (still cheaper than renting a bike for the day though). Download the app Spot Cycle for locations of docks as well as real time info on availability. Definitely recommend!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/03/2012,"Capital Bikeshare provides a convenience for people wanting to get around the DC metro area. That's the advantage of the company. But it's run by a shady, pure evil, fiercely for-profit company with a pricing scheme that's intentionally vague and extremely punishing. Capital Bikeshare is a borderline scam. I was visiting a friend in Washington for the weekend and signed up for the all-day pass, for $7, and went on a weekend ride for a few hours, but got charged almost $80. I'm sorry, but $80 is totally outrageous for a few hours of riding a silly bicycle. That's enough for me to rent 2 cars for the day, and for Capital Bikeshare to buy themselves a whole new bike! They're making a killing off of suckers!When I called them to ask why, I got put on a long hold, then talked to a rude and unhelpful employee in a loud room who could do nothing for me. When I asked to speak with his supervisor, he actually refused, then relented. When his supervisor came on the phone he told me he'd been listening in to the call and could only offer me a 50% refund. He was extremely rude and sarcastic and refused to pass me up to their actual managers. They must get complaints about this all the time.There is something like 147 pages of fine print that you could read on the screen at the stations if you're into that. Even their homepage is intentionally vague about this and you have to go to their pricing page to figure out what they mean. No one just walking up to their stations on the street would be able to figure this out unless maybe they spent 2 hours reading the fine print. They rely on this and are completely inflexible for poor suckers like me who just wanted to go for a bike ride. So, moral of the story. If you do use Capital Bikeshare, make sure to fully understand the punishing price scheme in advance. And God help anyone who somehow runs afoul of the pricing system or has some sort of pricing error. They will not understand your cries for mercy!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/05/2012,"We rented 3 bikes not far from the Martin Luther King  Memorial  a couple of weeks ago. As visitors to DC we found  Bikeshare very convenient and fun.  It was a great way to get out and cover a lot of ground around the monuments and the mall.  When we stopped at a monument one  person would have to stay with the bikes since  there are no bike locks or any  way to lock them up.   Like a lot of the reviews I was also shocked at the pricing techniques used. The pricing system is unnecessarily complicated for a reason. Our entire party read the sign and pricing structure and apparently none of us interpreted it right I was surprised to see the extra fees on my credit card the next day I understood that there would be a deposit hold of $101 so that was not a big deal. Nowhere and I mean nowhere did it state that our two and a half hour ride would cost an additional $30. Thank goodness we did not stay out longer. The whole concept of riding to the next station  within 30 minutes seems unrealistic to me. We cycled all around the Mall and did not  even see another docking station. I understand that for the people who use this system all the time Bikeshares fees and practices seem very clear . I guess these bikes are NOT for leisurely use but this particular docking station is located exactly where the tourists are and there aren't any kind of office buildings or businesses around so it is obviously not there for the commuters.This being said Bikeshare was a lot of fun, I don't know that if we had figured out how much it was going to cost in the beginning that we would have rented them still. 5 stars for fun 1 star for misleading pricing."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/04/2015,"This all started off good, bikes were nice and it helped us tourists to get to the Memorials quickly. But then things went ""downhill"".  When we were done and had to get going to the airport we couldn't find a station with 2 open spots so I had to go a mile out of our way to find somewhere to drop mine. We had paid our $8 each at the terminal and thought we were all done once we turned the bikes in - until we got our credit card bills with an additional $38 charge. When I called to ask what the hell that was for I was told you have to re-dock the bike every 30 minutes to avoid the outrageous fees. Who has time for that? I got my fee reduced but not waived, as they felt it was my fault for not understanding this and that $46 to have a bike for 3 hours that I thought would cost me $8 was okay by them. The way the website is laid out seems to be intentionally  misleading, stating ""Membership and Usage Fees"", with a chart below that clearly shows ""24 hours = $8"", ""3 Days = $17"", etc. but you have to scroll down to see that usage fees are listed  - and charged - separately. In doing some further research I've also found that the company has received $16 million in government subsidies as it is supposed to be helping low-income people commute and maintain employment, but that's not how it's being used. This company is clearly looking to make a big, fat profit off anybody who doesn't read and understand the convoluted rules - while also taking our tax payer dollars. They won't get a dime from me again unless this stops."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,09/14/2011,"It was fun, but there is still a $200 hold on my acct 3 days later. Not cool. I know it's my bank but it's lame!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/23/2012,"A year later, I have similar issues--It's a great idea when the system works, but when it doesn't it's a nightmare dealing with their incompetent customer service representatives. Their website is even worse, I've recently was not able to renew my membership online and their customer service on the phone were totally unhelpful....they keep blaming credit card companies when their system is down!"
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,05/24/2014,"I love riding Bikeshare. However, Bikeshare needs to hire customer service reps who can understand and speak English. I have called three times in the 2+ years; every time, I have had to repeat the simplest requests over and over to make myself understood. I have given up in frustration."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/22/2012,"The only part of this that is convenient is that they are expanding so much, so there are docking stations in a lot of great places. But the annoying outweighs the good so I will not be using there bikes again. They placed a $101 hold on my credit card account and when I called Customer Service, they told me it takes 3-8 business days to clear. When I asked why I was told "" Because a technician needs to go out to the station where your bike was parked to make sure there is no damage""That makes NO sense. There was a person at the docking station in Logan Circle who literally took the bike right after I docked it: so how would a technician be able to make sure I did no damage? How will they know if it was the person after me or the person after that person? It was a line of BC and I don't appreciate being fed that kind of bogus information after I was charged $29 dollars for 4 hours, with an additional $101 being held on my CC.I will not recommend this to anyone but I will recommend that they get onto craigslist and get themselves a used bike...it would cost about the same."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/30/2011,"I think the idea of Capital Bike Share is really fabulous.  However, on my very first ride, I experienced problems at both ends of the return trip - there was no bike at the dock to use to ride home. After I waited 10 - 15 minutes for one to return, I rode back to my point of origin and found the dock full.Since this happened, I've seen the dock empty on 3 occasions (which would have been at about the time I would have wanted the bike).  For a great idea to be truly great, it has to work!  I was charged a ""service fee"" for canceling my membership so my miserable experience the very first time I used the system cost twice as much as a one-day rate would have cost.  and I had read all the fine print first."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/28/2013,"As others have written, it's a great way to get around, but not very practical to use during rush hour (particularly weekdays 8-930).  I rarely see bikes avaliable in my area when heading to work, and the few times I do see them, I sometimes have to go way out of my way to find an open bike slot downtown, adding 20-30 mins to my morning commute.  EDIT:  I recently up-ed my review to 4 stars.  They have gotten slightly better during rush hour, and the metro has gotten much worse in the past year, especially during non-rush hours.  Even with few available bikes during rush hours, they are often the best option in town for getting around."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/18/2010,"Capital Bikeshare is not ready for prime time. I am a huge supporter of shared bike programs so I hate to give such an awful review, but I have had repeated problems returning bikes due to a lack of stall availability. Using the bikes to go downtown is the transportation equivalent of ""Musical Chairs."" I joined Capital Bikeshare about 3 weeks ago. I have used the bikes in the morning (9 AM to 10:30 AM) on several occasions between Woodley Park and the K Street corridor, Dupont Circle or the West End. Almost every time, I found no stalls open for return of the bike at my destination. In many instances there were no stalls available at adjacent stations and I was forced to ride to an distant station to return the bike, which obviously defeated the purpose of my usage. I have reported this problem to Capital Bikeshare staff, but they been unable to solve the problem (by increasing the number of stalls or temporarily decreasing the number of bikes in the system). I'm getting a refund & waiting until I see evidence that the problem is solved."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/28/2011,I love bikeshare.  It is easy and quick.  If they can get the kinks of full stations or empty stations (one when you need the other) worked out then it will be perfect.  I have often found myself walking to 3-4 stations to pick up a bike even when the app says there is one available.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/20/2013,"These are AWESOME!  We rent bikes in every city we visit.  This is a great way to see DC.  Very convenient.  You do need to use the smart phone app so you can find the locations and know how many bikes there are - spotcycle.net.  The bikes are in great shape, they have flashing lights on the front & back.  They do NOT have helmets nor locks, so you can't stop and sight see unless you can find a bikeshare location to leave them.  Also tricky - you could leave them and come back to no bikes (hence the need for that website).  We used them for 3 days and visited all of central DC, monuments, Georgetown, Rock Creek Park, Adams Morgan/Dupont, the zoo.  You can't go wrong!  The cost is $7 for a day, or $15 for 3.  Use of 30 minutes or less is free, but only $2 for an hour."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/02/2010,"I used smartbike for over a year. It had its drawbacks such as the limited number of bike stations but it allowed me to have the bike for 3 hours at a time which was great!When capital bikeshare came out, they gave me free membership since I was a smartbike member. Pros: More bike stationsCons:  I can only use it 30 minutes at a time! So if I have to go from Waterfront to Dupont Circle, I have to switch bikes in between or else they'll charge me for going over 30 minutes! That just wastes my time.PLUS, they make it impossible for me to bike quickly to make it in time without switching bikes because the bikes are SOOOO heavy!!!  You really get tired out quickly!  I feel like I'll have the thighs of a soccer player in a week! And I thought the smartbikes were heavy. Worth it?  For someone who doesn't have a car ... I suppose."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/06/2012,"WOW!!!! What a Joke.  Capital Bikeshare claims to be the cheapest rental out there to bring you in and then they hit you with the FINE PRINT!!!! Beware, I took my son to DC to view the city and sights, little did we know that the bikes need to be checked in at a station every 30 minutes.  After thinking i had spent 30 dollars on a three day bike rental, I got hot with a $420.00 bill for the excess charges....no wounder they can afford to stay in business......."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/26/2011,"Buyer beware, it is NOT $5 for a 24 hour bike rental!!!  There are stiff usage fees if you do not dock the bike at least every 30 minutes!!So I'm in D.C. a couple of weeks ago for a conference, and happen across one of the bike rental stations.  Great, it's a nice day so I check it out.  Hmm, $5 for a 24 hour rental, sign me up!  Ride it around 3 hours to all the sights, docking it once, and then return to my original station.  All is well until I get the credit card bill - $27.50 frickin dollars!!  For a three hour bike rental!!  Well I did not see any information on the ""usage"" fees at the rental station, or the very important piece of information that unless you dock it every 30 minutes you will pay out the wazoo.  So I believe that the whole thing is rather misleading, especially for tourists like me.To their credit, they took off 1/2 of the usage fees after I complained (my impresssion is that they get a lot of complaints like this from first time users, as they have a policy to address it), leaving my charge a still hefty $16.50 for a three hour rental.  So I am adding one star for that.I guess if you live there and just need to get from point A to point B it is a good system.  But as a tourist rental it doesn't seem to make sense.  Probably better to rent a bike at a shop somewhere."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,11/07/2010,"I am a new user that has not ridden a bike in years.  I used Capitol Bikeshare this weekend all around downtown DC and Capitol Hill, and was quite pleased.  The system to check out and return bikes is easy to use, the bikes are solid, sturdy and easy-to-ride 3-speeds with a bell, and everything seemed to be in good repair.  I checked my account online this evening and was able to view my trips.I had fun on these bikes, and was surprised to learn how easy it is to ride around downtown on the weekend.  Glad I joined!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/03/2012,"This is my favorite thing about living in Washington, DC.  It isn't our abundance of small plates restaurants, our free museums, our National Monuments, our international flavor, our theater scene, or our easy to navigate metro system.  No, the best thing about Washington, DC is the 1200+ red bikes scattered around the city ready for me at the swipe of a plastic keychain.   You can get almost anywhere in this city within the 30 minute free travel window. I'm not too cool to occasionally stop at a halfway point to check in and check out when my ride is going to require more than the 30 minutes.  Bikeshare is amazing.  Their maps are easy to follow, their Spotcycle app is always accurate, and their website keeps a really fun tally of al your travels if you want to know just how quickly you made it from U Street to Dupont on a day when all the traffic lights were green for a change and I wanted to make it to the red line metro without a 20 minute hike. The National Mall is also a far better site to visit when admired from a shiny red bike. Who needs to hike the 3+ miles from end to end when you could do that full loop to spend time at every major monument in just an hour and spend the rest of your time having fun around town?  Every other city should be so lucky to have one of these too."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/05/2013,Worst customer service ever!!  Three weeks still no annual membership!!!  Go buy a bike before you give them your money!!!
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,02/02/2011,"I love that this program has really taken off in DC.  Bike stations are everywhere! I was just there visiting and used the bike share on my own and also part of a tour with some of the engineers who are improving the bike lanes, etc. in the region. It was super easy to use and the bikes are awesome."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/08/2012,"I love capital bikeshare.  Yes, there are some issues but it's an awesome addition to DC.  While I do not use it to commute, it is great way to get around DC especially if there is not a direct metro or bus connection.  For example - I take it from U St NW to H St NE and it's the fastest way.  While it cannot be guaranteed, it works pretty well.  There are a few places that need more docks to increase density but as it become more popular I hope that will no longer be an issue.  I love it when I'm out on a Bikeshare bike and I see 10 other people on the bikes and we smile and nod at each other.  One thing that would be great is if they had a listing of important bike laws in DC such as riding on the sidewalk being illegal in the central business district.  I've had to call customer service and they have been polite and helpful to me.  When my family rented bikes when they were in town, they found the details concerning prices (increasing per half hour over the first one) to be pretty straightforward and not hidden from view.  I'm uncertain how people who read the whole thing on the station don't realize it's not just a $7 rental which would be ridiculously under priced."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/20/2013,"What could possibly be better?  You can ride these bikes FREE for up to 30 minutes and then just dock it at one of their kiosks.  You don't need to lock it up, maintain it or worry about it at all.  Daily monthly and annual memberships work for almost everyone."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/06/2011,They expected (without informing me) that I dock in the bike every 30 minutes!  Is it practical to dock in every 30 minutes in the first place?!!!  The charged me bucks for every 30 minuets WITHOUT informing me!! WTF!! Their price model is fucked up! MISLEADINGGGGGGG...... It come out more expensive than renting a car...WAY MORE!! I HATE THEM!!
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,01/20/2012,"I love the concept of this program and I enjoy using the bikes as transportation.  I would have given an overwhelmingly positive review if not for one thing: after I signed up for a year membership and paid $75, I found out that I can't ride a bike until my key shows up in a week!  I called customer service and asked if there was a way around this, whether they would give me a code to unlock the bikes for the next week, and they said no.  So even after paying for a year membership (that I believe starts as of the time when I paid the $75), I have to keep paying the short-term rate if I want to use a bike.  I am very disappointed and wish they would be more clear up front about that."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/12/2010,"I tried Capital Bikeshare tonight for $5 and upon returning home signed up for a $50 year membership.  The amount of stations makes this an excellent choice for city transit, and you never have to worry about locking up and storing your personal bike.  The only thing preventing me from giving this service a 5 star rating is the 30 minute time limit.  I live/work in DC and attend school in Arlington, so I'd like to be able to make that ride occasionally without having to pay extra.  Still, a great service that I imagine will become very popular!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/15/2014,"BEWARE! Renting a bike from Capital Bikeshare is much more expensive than what you think it will cost you from reading the display sign on the machine.  $7 is for a stupid 'daily membership' (whatever that is) and you'll be charged by the 1/2 hour after the first 30 minutes for use.  The way CB prices their rentals is absolutely misleading, especially if you're a tourist.  Absolutely no one will stand there to read 106 pages of the rental agreement on an electronic menu screen the size of an iPhone when you have a huge line of people behind you.  I was charged over $50 PLUS the $7 membership fee for about 4-5 hours of use.  You will NOT be paying $7 for 24 hour use.  CB can get away with basically just listing $7 for a 24 hour share (which highly misleads people into thinking it will only cost them $7) because more likely than not, the true cost of the rental is buried somewhere in the 106 pages of rental agreement on the electronic menu screen.  If this were a company that didn't try to deceptively market their rentals, why don't they simply state in big letters and numbers on their machines that bike rentals really cost $10-15 per hour?  The level of deception feels like almost borderline illegal.  You are better off spending 10x less on a metro pass to get around DC rather than rent a bike that will cost you more than $50 for a few hours.  Even a cab is probably cheaper.  To put this in even more perspective, my brother and his wife were also with me when we decided to rent bikes; it cost $101 to simply rent a bike for the both of them for a few hours.  Absolutely shameful and a massive ripoff."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/29/2012,"OK so I gave Capital Bikeshare a terrible review a few days ago. Basically, I said the pricing model was a joke. They grossly overcharged me and then the customer service representative was  a jerk about it on the phone. They finally agreed to cut my bill in half and I look at my account today and they are charging me for more service that I never engaged in. I would stay away from this company. Do not use your personal debit card or credit card. This company seems to have no idea how to serve a customer."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/29/2010,"Being new to the area, I signed up for the program because it was a green option and a convenient way to get around the city, or so I thought. While there are many stations interspersed throughout DC, I think a few more racks are needed- one closer to the Georgetown University campus and the Judiciary Square or Union station would be nice.As for the bikes...In general, I find that commuting to an office or making a trip to the store on them is inconvenient at best. The black basket(?) is a joke- it doesn't really fit anything except for a narrow bag or briefcase. Why didn't they put some kind of rack on the back if there was not enough room to do so in the front? On the plus side, they are sturdy and durable. Moreover, if you choose to travel at night, the light option is a nice feature. However, if you have a bag to place in the small basket(?), the light is almost completely covered which defeats its purpose.  As for the ride itself-- I'm a petite person and I find it VERY clunky and difficult to maneuver esp. around  pedestrians. And for me, the seat really needs to be lower than the 1 option. For an annual membership, I also think it would be nice to have more than 1/2 hour free. Certain docks seem to fill more quickly than others.Overall, I think this is a great idea, but improvements are needed.  Although I want to be supportive of such an effort, I have to admit I'm a little disappointed by the program and would probably not recommend it to a friend."

Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/15/2019,"Must do when in Chicago! We loved renting these bikes! It super simple, you dont even need to sign up for it. Use the bikes to ride up and down the lake, its fantastic."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,03/08/2019,"Dissapointed Very disappointed with Divvy Bikes and Brenda in their customer service department, rented two bikes during my trip to Chicago, returned both bikes when I was done, for X or Y reason one of them didn’t register in; now I gotta spend my time disputing a $140 charge for 18hrs of a bike I didn’t use. They can see in their system where I returned them and times, I think these bikes even have GPS. Would love to know if anyone else has gone thru a similar experience?"
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,02/25/2019,"Dishonest company.. Terrible customer service Had one of the worst customer service experience with this company. After coordinating with the company via email and phone multiple times for over a month for issuing key, I am back to square 1. Learnt that either the form was not filled, or it got lost..How on the earth the form can get lost if you received 5 phone calls and 2 emails?on top of that you are not even accommodating and apologetic?SHAME"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,02/12/2019,"Practical, eco-friendly transportation Awesome to be able to use bikes throughout this beautiful city. This is a good way to get to know the city, go to its neighborhoods, exercise, commute and more.,"
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,01/23/2019,Service has gone way down. Not reliable anymore. Ive been a member for a couple years now and I will not be renewing my membership. The system has consistently went down hill. It has become very unreliable. From stations not having any bikes to get or stations being full all around and nowhere to dock your bike. Then I have had issues with stations locking a bike in but turning red and then my key gets shut off and you have to call and they had to get someone out to get the bike before my key could be turned back on. Or the multiple times that stations just aren't working for some reason. It just isn't a reliable way to get around the city anymore.
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/23/2018,Very very very convenient Bike sharing in Chicago is a good way to see Chicago as well as get from point A to point B. Divvy bikes makes that experience even better as they have a very simple and easy to use solution.
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,11/12/2018,"Charged $150 dollars for a 30 minute ride I was charged $150 dollars for an incorrectly docked bike (that I infact returned). I recall bringing my bike back to the location that I got it from just outside of the United center and docking the bike. I was told by the help desk that despite that the other bike I had rented had been returned within the allotted timeframe, the other bike was not an therefore went undocked for 2 days resulting in a $150 charge. They do not have GPS on the bikes so therefore could not verify that it was in fact in the same exact location for that time. I will never use these bikes again and stick with the more reliably supported infrastructure of public transportation or Uber."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/29/2018,"Divvy system malfunction & I was charged for 40 hours of ride time The Divvy system does not accurately track bike docking. I used a 30 minute pass and docked the bike within that time period. It was my first time using the bike so I waited for the light to turn green showing it was docked. Fast forward a day and a half, I get an email letting me know that I am being charged for 40 HOURS of ride time ($140!). I called the customer service line to let them know there must be a mistake. Customer service was not understanding at all and would only refund 50% due to ""User Error"". I asked what else I should have done as a user to make sure the bike was docked and the representative told me to wait for the green light. When I explained that I did wait for the green light, the representative told me I was not correct because their system did not show a green light. Now I am out $70 through no fault of my own with no good faith full refund or credit from Divvy's customer service. As a first time user of this product, this is no way to build a customer base. Very disappointed in this company- would not recommend."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/08/2018,Way more fine than I thought. The machines are pain in the butt and you only have 5 minutes to put the codes in to get the bikes unlocked. You also cannot rent more than 4 per credit card. But the are nice bikes with convenient return sites. What a great way to explore Chicago and the Lake!
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/24/2018,Very fun and convenient!  We had a great time with these bikes. You get some beautiful views. They are plenty of stations to park around downtown. This was our first time in the city and it was much cheaper than constant Ubering.
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/16/2018,Only for americans! What a disapointment! Divvy Bikes is a service only for american people. They don’t accept non US credit cards nor give an alternative. They simply ignore the foreign turists. What a disapointment!
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,09/12/2018,"Not bad but still needs work So I got my first Divvy bike with a 30 mins pass to get to university. The bike was not bad I just had to adjust the height of the seat. Some people said that the bikes are heavy and it is hard to ride them. Well they are not entirely wrong. The bike was heavier than usual and it only had 3 gears so you could not go very fast with it, but I cannot say that it was very hard to ride, it was ok.I got my pass via the Divvy mobile app. You can download it from app store and google play. I am going to be honest with you, the app officially sucks! After refreshing and reseting multiple times I was able to get to the page that gives the pass. After paying the fee the app gives you a code that you enter on the keyboard next to your chosen bike and the dock releases it for you. Then a timer appears on the app that counts your riding time. You can also buy passes at the station but I should warn you that they do only accept credit cards (no debit cards or gift cards).There is a map on the app that shows you where is each station and how many bikes and empty docks it has. When you wanna get a bike you touch the plan a ride button on the app. Since it is 3$ for only 30 minutes you have to be careful and plan your ride ahead and make sure there are empty docks at your destination. When you wanna return the bike you just have to take it to an empty dock and push the bike forward until the dock grabs it. Then a green light appears that means the bike is successfully attached. Be careful if you do not put back the bike correctly you could be charged for a very long time. To make sure, you can refresh the app and the timer on top of it disappears. To sum up, I think that this is a good service that still needs work, but if you are looking for a healthy and cheap way to get around I definitely recommend it."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,09/11/2018,"A good idea, with some minor issues While in town visiting for the weekend, we rented two bikes so that we could ride with our hosts. There are many locations, in popular spots, so pretty convenient for us. One can rent with just a credit card, or by using the app, while creating an account, which is easy.The first rental went fine, although checking the bikes in was questionable, as the kiosk was offline when we went to rent again. While on hold to report the issue, a technician arrived and rebooted the kiosk. We were then able to take bikes out. The bikes are comfortable, and very sturdy (also heavy), but with three speeds they were fine for the bike path near Lake Shore Drive. Overall a pretty good service."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/06/2018,"Great experience We paid for a day use and then rode along the lake in the morning. We had some other plans for the afternoon, but came back and rode down the lake that evening because we had enjoyed it so much. It was really a ton of fun. There are plenty of stations to pick up and return bikes. Price was good. Only complaint was that the bikes needed a bit of work."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,08/31/2018,"Great idea, needs fine tuning I want to really like this service. The idea is fantastic and I'm sure the teams involved worked very hard to implement this. Let me start by saying that the bike I rode was smooth, the experience of riding in Chicago was both exhilarating and satisfying. I highly recommend giving it a try and I hope they remain in service for a long time to come. Today was the first day that I attempted to buy a pass and ride a bike. I bought my pass using the app, located the nearest dock, followed the process of keying in the code to unlock the bike, the lights first turned orange and then green. I put my hand on the handle bar to pull it off the dock and it stayed put. No matter what I tried I could not take the bike off the dock. I realized that the bike never unlocked for whatever be the reason. I looked the FAQs in the app, there is nothing there about troubleshooting unlocking a bike (code correct but dock didn't disengage lock) I called their call center and was on hold for 10 minutes, in the end I did not get to speak with anyone. The app displays the unlock code only once, I could not use the code to unlock a different bike. You are made to provide your phone number and email address however the code is neither emailed to you nor texted. Neither could I purchase another pass. It was all very frustrating, the app just displayed the time elapsed, calories, start point end point. I headed to the kiosk and purchased another pass with the intention of appealing for a refund at a later time. With the new code in hand I successfully unlocked a bike and tried to key in my destination in the Divvy app in order to point to the closest dock to my destination. Lo and behold there was a button at the bottom of the map ""Unlock Bike"" I don't know whether I'll be able to use the loaded pass for my return trip but I will try and see. I wont need a refund if it works. There needs to be better instruction, troubleshooting, the user experience of the app definitely needs a little more thought and improvement. Will I rent another Divvy? Absolutely and so should you!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/27/2018,"Divvy is a wonderful resource in Chicago Divvy is a wonderful resource in Chicago, not only for tourists but also for residents who use this system as a way to go to work and to transit the city in an eco-friendly manner. As a resident, I seem to remember that you now can use it each time for 45 minutes (instead of the traditional 30 minutes per ride). Is that true? I do not want to assume that and incur in non-desired extra charges."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/25/2018,"Best way to see the city We stayed for a night in the city for my bday. We biked everywhere super convenient and lots of fun. Reasonably priced and the divvy returns were everywhere in the city. 
A few of the bikes needed maintenance but overall in good shape."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/21/2018,Great way to travel the city I had never done one of these before but just loved it. Was able to get around the city quickly and safely. Loved going on the bike trails. There are parking stations all over the city and it is a 24-hour service so I could take it out at night and come back. Much better than calling an uber or taking public transit. The bikes were very comfortable and even had 3 gears to change for maneuvering some of the hills. The stations were easy to return the bikes and get out a new one. Highly recommend.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/14/2018,Divvy bike riding is fun in Chicago summer! One of the most fun things to do in Chicago in the summer.   Highly recommended!  Definitely try out the lake shore path!  :)
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/03/2018,"Do this! Even if you are going on a mile long walk from the loop to the pier, rent a bike. It's worth it. The kids loved it and so did the grown ups!You can see quite a bit of Chicago in a shorter period of time, relatively cheaper than a lyft."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/02/2018,Best way around Downtown Got a bike at Navy Pier and wish I had found them earlier.  Lots of fun (on the quieter streets) and a great way to get from place to place without the slowness of walking.
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/29/2018,"PLEASE READ THIS FIRST if you have a large group Ok, I had 15 people in our group. You can only take 4 bikes out under one credit card. So you will have to use multiple credit cards if you have more than4 to rent.Also, use the divvy locator app to find stations close to where you are and how many bikes are there. So when you want to turn them back in you have to find a station with enough empty spots. Kind of a challenge with a large group. And we had problems at the first station because there were two defective bikes that we couldn’t release from the stand. I ended up calling the customer service line three times and visiting two stands before getting all the bikes. The touch screen at the kiosk was hard to use (screen couldn’t read our button pressing). And once you pay and get the code to release the bikes you only have 5 minutes before it expires. Some would take the code right away and some you had to enter several times before accepting. If you go past 5 minutes you have to re-dock all the bikes and start all over. AND if you plan on taking a nice leisurely bike ride on the Lakeshore Trail, forget about it. There are way too many people that apparently are training for the Tour de France or something because they are flying around at top speeds, yelling at you if you aren’t accommodating them. I had 13 year olds and even though it said you had to be 16, they were fine on these bikes. Easy to ride even though they are well-broken in at this point. Great idea and value but you may need lots of patience."
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/27/2018,"No good for overseas tourists My wife and I were looking forward to using the Divvy bikes along the lakeside in Chicago. I downloaded the Divvy App on my phone having first checked it would be possible to hire two bikes using the same debit card. We successfully secured the first bike however when I tried to unlock the second bike I was presented with a message saying I couldn’t have a bike at this time. After numerous attempts we tried to use the kiosk but the payment was rejected. I used three Visa cards including an American Express Card. All were rejected.Eventually, I called a number that we found on the App (the telephone number shown on the Kiosk was alpha numerical so would not work in my phone). I’m sorry to say the gentleman I spoke to after a very long wait was super dumb. I explained very clearly and on numerous occasions what I had done but he was unable to think of a solution other than putting the one bike we had successfully hired back into the docking station and starting all over again (I tried this without success). Eventually after 15 minutes I suggested we try a different docking station and rang off. The next docking station was manned by a young women. We explained our problem and she said she did not know why the app would not work for the second bike. She did however say that the kiosks do not accept cards issued from abroad. Can you believe it! When it comes to payment processing the US has always been behind other parts of the world (e.g. chip and pin).She kindly offered us the second bike free of charge. A good solution for now but not for later on in the day or on future days unless we bumped into her again. I have to assume hiring two bikes on one card cannot be done with an international card. We had a great time cycling on the lakeside. We cycled for many miles in a very safe (car free) and beautiful environment. Come on Chicago. We’re not all American you know. You should be trying harder to encourage more tourists to your beautiful city."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/22/2018,Lakeshore ride User friendly with easy access from place to place. We rented 4 bikes and did a mid morning ride along Lakeshore Drive in Chi Town. We were able to stop along the route to eat and socialize before returning the bikes. Great way to get around on a trip and there are various bike racks throughout the area if you need to end your ride or that a break and do something else. 
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/19/2018,"Not good I wanted to get a bike to ride to lunch on my break. I spent most of my break trying to unlock every single available bike and it wouldn’t release. I had already been charged and tried to call and email customer support and never heard back. I ended up having to uber (spending more money and time). Will not be trying ever again!!! It’s only $3 so it’s not a huge deal, it was more of an inconvenience for me. Also, I have done these bikes in other states and had no problem."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,06/26/2018,Customer Service Be sure to push the bike in all the way when docking it. My husband rented the bike for 1 hour but we ended up getting charged $79.21. We are new to the whole bike sharing thing as it is not available where we live. When I called they offered 50% refund but I pushed a little harder. They said they would credit the whole amount. I told them to refund all but the 1 hour. I hope they mean what they said. Will wait to see if the credit comes through. Great way to get around Chicago but the payment/process seems hard to understand. Good customer service if credit comes through.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/17/2018,"Loved these bikes! Easy and convenient! We loved these bikes and found them very easy to use. It was a very hot day and after attending a craft fair we didn’t want to walk any further. A bike ride along the lake seemed like a relief from the heat! On a whim we purchased the 24 hr pass! We were hooked! In those 24 hours we ended up seeing much more of the city than we intended! We rode to Lincoln Park, Wrigley Field, the Bean, Zoo, Navy Pier, Willis Tower, Field House, Art Institute, Soldier Field and several museums. The bike paths were easy to navigate, we saved on transportation and as a bonus had a mini workout!The paths were pretty level and the bikes have gears to help the small inclines we encountered. A few days later when we had to get to our boat ride at the pier, rather than taking an Uber or Lyft, it was easier to get another 24 hour pass. We were at our destination in 10 mins! After dinner and the boat ride we picked up some bikes and rode back to the hotel. The bonus being the next day we were able to enjoy the remaining time on our pass!There were bikes available at all locations, some of which had friendly staff on site to help. The bikes were sturdy and well maintained. There are plenty of spots to pick up and drop off!This made our trip and would recommend it for all ages. "
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/31/2018,"Easy access but watch your time I'm rating this poor because I am frustrated with the payment system. We used the bikes on our stay in Chicago as a easy way to get around, which it was and they were great. BUT you have to watch your time! We docked our bikes less than 2 minutes ""over"" and were charged another 30 minutes. SO if you are going to use the bikes make sure you know your way around and where you will be docking them, otherwise you'll be paying them, and paying them, then paying them again!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/27/2018,"Wonderful Biking along Lake Michigan We were in Hyde Park to visit the University of Chicago and wanted to go Downtown for a day. Divvy Bikes made that possible without needing to take the CTA or the Metro or the South Shore Line, all possible alternatives. The day was beautiful and we were able to ride along the Lake Front from Hyde Park to the Art Institute. Once we crossed the outer drive at 55th street using the underpass, it was beautiful riding with no traffic lights and no cars. Time for an easy ride, about 35 minutes. Divvy Bikes was easy to use for a full 24 hour duration that allowed us to get on and off downtown as we pleased. We had a little trouble at two docking or parking spots where the codes did not work, but we managed to get it straight within a few minutes (by replacing the two bikes we took out and then starting over again for the three bikes that we needed. I recommend biking around Chicago from Hyde Park to downtown. Bring your own helmet."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/01/2018,"New Fare Structure! First, please ignore the one star reviews that say ""it isn't clear I have to return the bike in 30 minutes"". It's right there on the machine when you dip your card in, so there' s no ""scam"" going on, just folks who don't take the time to read the instructions. The new fare structure has a $15 ""explorer pass"" which allows you to take the bike out for up to 3 hours without re-docking, There's also a $3 option for a single 30 minute ride. They keep adding more bikes and stations, so the system keeps getting better."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/29/2018,"What an easy way to see Chicago Got a Divvy bike across from the Hilton Chicago. Checked out their bike program first online, then hit the streets. $3/30 min with credit card. If bike is lost or stolen, then $1200 charge. Easy to find other Divvy racks to dock your bike. Make sure the green light is lit before you walk away from bike and check the area you want to bike to, to see if there is available dock for your bike. 3 speed bikes with baskets. Chicago isn't the most bike friendly town, so you'll be dodging peds. Overall, I really liked using this program for my visit to Chicago."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,01/21/2018,divvy bikes it is grate to have if you are new to the city there are many places to doc themi rode around went shopping and did things i needed to do i have a bike butit needed air in the tires i said o well i will just rent a bike for a few days
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/29/2017,"Good concept but needs work Loved the concept of this! Being able to cycle from place to place and return your bike so no worrying about locking it to anything. This was great as visiting from the UK means we obviously couldn't bring our own bikes! The bikes were heavy but were easy to ride. I think we had 4 or 5 different bikes throughout the day, generally all were in good condition with the exception of the last one. Chicago by bike is a good way to go and this concept is brilliant.Bikes were hard to get out of the locks and also at times hard to put back in again!Would recommend using these though as made us be able to see alot more of the city on our short trip. "
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/22/2017,"Fun way to get around, and get a some exercise too!!! The $9.95 day pass is a good deal, but be prepared to switch bikes every half hour...not a second more. As a frustrated reviewer noted, you will be billed. However, quite fun to ride along the lake, get to the museums and the Navy Pier, Millenium Park, the Bean, etc. The instructions could be made easier for us folks getting up in years. Still a great way to see the lakefront."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/18/2017,"Perfect way to experience Chicago's downtown They are so well organized, we took a 24Hour pass (Keep a watch on the clock because you have to return back to the stand every 30 mins unless you want to pay ofcourse- the app is amazing, it will guide you to the Divvy stand close to you)We were cycling around Downtown for close to 6 hours :) I think Chicago is soo pretty that driving around it would be an injustice. Stop at good spots, do not miss to capture the beautiful sunset. I am sure you will love it as much as I did :)"
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/11/2017,Not For People Unfamiliar with Divvy's Deceptive Fee Structure I got the $9.95 day pass. I was billed $102 because I either didn't see or understand their rental policy requiring you to check in your bicycle every 30 minutes. I had the bike for 22 hours. I had problems checking the bike out and when I called support they had to reboot the station software twice before I was able to check the bike out. During this frustrating period I didn't see any contractual obligations to check in the bike every 30 minutes.When I complained about the billing to customer service they reduced my fee by $50 which I found to be unacceptable. I disputed the charges with my credit card company and they honored my contention and in the end I was only charged $9.95.If you're unfamiliar with the Chicago Metro area Divvy's 30 minute check in requirement and the fallibility of their network may cost you more grief than the convenience of their bicycles.The bikes are 3 speed and are generally suitable for typical short recreational/commuter rides.Their fee structure and use policies need to be more clearly stated and printed on your receipt and at the rental kiosk.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/09/2017,Amazing experience enjoying Chicago on a bike is an incredible experience. I recommend this pleasure to everyone Aline or Friends
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/03/2017,"Great value, great fun. Many places rent bikes for $10/hour. Divvy is $10 for the day as long as you swap out the bikes every 30 minutes. It was easy to do. We picked up the bikes along the water from by millennium park. We biked south along the river, swapping out at McCormick Place. Then we went to the Museum of Science and Industry. After a few hours we took bikes from the station in front of the museum and cycled back, swapping out again at McCormick. It is a fantastic dedicated path,not near any cars and very well maintain"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/03/2017,Enjoy riding in Chicago Chicago has some great trails to ride on and also see the sights Especially along the lake. These bikes are decent to get around. Mind you if you are avid rider you should rent a real road bike but these are truly just a bike. They are decently maintained but as one review said the fees can add up. I thought i was getting charged $10 for the day but ended up at $17. You really need to only go from docking point to docking point because they are only allotting you 30 minutes-at a time to ride before extra charges kick in. I know people in my home town that just go to the next docking point under the 30 minute time then take the same bike out and go to the next stop. Still would rent them again but you need to know how they charge.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/23/2017,"Who'd have thought? Who would have thought that renting a little blue bike for 24 hours would have been so worth it? Between the giggles and the easy sightseeing, 100% worth the rental. We got around so easily and saw a lot of things that were on the list it was fabulous! Just do it."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,09/05/2017,"Read Before Renting The Divvy Bikes look like a good option but there are pitfalls. The price is right, there is no doubt. And, the bikes are in good shape for the most part. But, be aware that the cost can escalate if you are not careful. The $9.95 will cover numerous rides of under 30 minutes for the full 24 hour period. However, that means you have to renew the bike in under 30 minutes at one of the stations. If you do not, there are additional charges. We had problems with finding a station within thirty minutes and, on one occasion, finding a station with empty slots to renew our bike. Make sure you choose your bike wisely before taking it out of the stall. A few have soft tires, many are greasy and some seats are better than others. You use your credit card to rent and renew the bikes. We used one card for 4 bikes. But, that required that we all stick together so we could renew our bikes. Of course, we didn't think of that so occasionally went our own way. That created problems since our daughters could not renew their bikes. The time penalties are cumulative and can become costly. We found the thirty minute renewal time was not adequate. So, it is your choice to try to stay within the thirty minute renewal or ignore that requirement and pay the price."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/31/2017,"Highly recommended The Divvy Bike Sharing is a highly recommended way of getting around Chicago. Ten dollars buys you a 24 hour pass. You can grab a bike from any station, take a ride and return the bike to any of the 580 station within 30 minutes. Get a new code, grab another bike and be on your way again. Very convenient!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/28/2017,"Great fun These bikes are all over the park area and downtown. It is a great way to take advantage of a bike city without hauling a bike. One downfall is having to check in at a divvy station every 30 mins. Sometimes we went over. But the fee for going over isn't too ridiculous, so it was still a good bargain and great fun. Bikes are simple to operate and ride. Just watch out for the bike commuters. They are traveling with a purpose, frequently faster than motorized vehicles; they are not out for a leisurely ride. Give way to them. "
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/22/2017,"The super fun approach to Chicago! Wing Commander had a DIVVY plan it it worked out ... TIP 1: Book 24 hours.TIP 2: North Side to Navy Pier, walk to Chicago River for Official Chicago Architectural Foundation Tour ... 7:30 PM is a charmer. Then return by  DIVVY under starlight and Chicago skyline all shined up.  Or some facsimile of the above itinerary ...AND you still have a morning ride along the Lakeshore in the opposite direction. TIP 3: We lost our code at 10 at night ... tap the screen, then reinsert credit card. Et voila a new pin will be printed for you. "
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/15/2017,"Biking near ""beaches"" and outskirts of city is awesome While riding the Ferris wheel on the Navy Pier, we decided to get the bikes and we went to the divvy website on our smartphones and got a $2 off coupon code. It's been a week and I have gotten no junk email from divvy, so that's good. For $10/day plus fees and tax, you get to use the bike for up to 30 min bike rides at a time at no extra cost. With the coupon code, my total was $10.50-something. Then there is a sliding scale for the length of your ride: 30-60 min is $2 extra, etc. but as long as you dock the bike at a station by 30min per ride you are not charged extra. Using the bikes for transportation along the boardwalk(?) on the water nearby the Navy Pier worked well for me, my teenage sister, adult sister and uncle. We had no extra charges for leasurely riding from Navy pier to Belmont. We were all thankful for the 3 gears that you can easily change on the right bike handle for going up and down the little inclines along the path. What a beautiful invigorating ride! The seats are adjustable and the ride is comfy. I don't usually ride a bike and my butt wasn't sore like it is after riding sometimes. I was able to strap my purse and water bottle on the front handlebars with the attached bungee-type cord and my belongings stayed secure."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/08/2017,"HORRIBLE SCAM.NEVER AGAIN DO NOT USE DIVVY BIKES. I swiped my card and agreed to a $39.98 payment for supposably a 24 HOUR RENTAL that we only ended up using for two hours!! This was not the case! Supposably you are suppose to ""check in"" every half hour, (which was not listed on the machine, nor was it listed in an email). Like I said, we used the bikes for TWO HOURS, THREE WEEKS AGO AND I JUST GOT CHARGED $170 TODAY. This is a scam for anyone and everyone that is not local and I'm sick to my stomach about it. When I called customer service I rudely got hung up on the first time, and the second call they told me they would refund half ($85) but only refunded me $65!!! I have a manager that is suppose to contact me in 24 hours so we will see how that goes. Had the instructions been more clear, we would've gladly paid the $6 additional for each bike for the additional 60 mins like its stated on the website. They had no right charging my card for a transaction I did not agree with unless the bikes were lost stolen or damaged!!! I filed a dispute with my bank, which I hardly doubt I will get my refund because visa has to take it to them to dispute and they are going to take that $170 that they literally pulled out of their butt, and say it's for a misc charge like they told me. I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN AND I ADVISE ANYONE AND EVERYONE TO NEVER USE THEM AGAIN NEITHER!! IF I WANTED TO OAY $170 FOR PETAL BIKES I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT FOUR BIKES THAT WE COULD HAVE USED FOR MUCH LONGER THAN 2 HOURS!! What a scam. "
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/01/2017,"Best way to see the city! This was the best decisiion that we made on our trip. It was amazing to see the city and have some fun. You get everywhere fast, you never have to wait on public transportation. I see that some people complain about the 30 minutes, but it was never a problem for us. We rode from the Feild Musuem to Lincoln park and made it within 30 minutes. You will have no trouble. If you use the app you can ask for an additional 15 minutes to find a spot to dock your bike. It really should be no problem. If they didn't have people lock up their bikes, they would end up leaving it outside of restaurants/ stores while they shop. If it got stolen then you would be charged $1,200 The only way to prevent this would be to have bike locks on the bikes themselves. Seems more complicated that way."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/31/2017,"Beware- 30 minute limit or pay $$$ We have rented bikes in Philly, DC, San Fran, etc and had a great time exploring. We rented in Chicago for 3-4 hours -- the total charge was well over $200 bc we didn't find a station to ""check in"" every 30 minutes (which would have been impossible riding along the lakefront). It's a horrible concept if you want to take a bike and explore .... They also do not make it clear when you rent the bikes -- we will not be using it again!"
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/31/2017,"Use them all the time I use them every time I'm in town. If the weather is good they are better than a car. The only thing that drives me nuts is the 30 minute time limit. That is really an inconvenience. They are fairly well maintained, but of the 5 bikes I was on this weekend only 1 did not have some problem, although all were minor."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/30/2017,"Great concept  This is the 1st time we used the bike system. We got around faster and saw the sights. I gave a 5 star rating but there are a few problems. We rode to the field museum, when we arrived the rack was 100% full. You must wait until more bikes are rented before returning yours. This took 10 minutes of waiting, who knows it could have been an hour. Then you must find a rack and return the bike every 30 minutes to avoid extra charges. Even so I will use them again."
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/28/2017,Slightly annoying  Bikes were in great condition. While we enjoyed the experience of riding through Chicago-it was a pain in the tale to find a docking station every 30 minutes that had empty slots and to have to re-swipe a credit card for yet another access code.
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/27/2017,"Good concept, difficult in practice We liked the idea of these bikes that we saw all over the city, though in practice they were a little harder to use. You can only use them for 30 minutes before you get charged a fee, and it is a challenge to get the bikes out, get on the path, and get them back to another station within 30 minutes. An hour would be much more appropriate. In addition, we had to search hard to find a station with enough bikes for our family at times. The app was very helpful in finding the bike stations. We will probably not use it again, because of the challenges and the short length of time, I do not feel we got our money's worth. But if you are traveling solo, and know exactly where you will return your bike, it may work better for you. For a family riding on the Lakefront trail, you would be better off to rent from one of the bike rental shops in Millenium Park or on Navy Pier. "
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/26/2017,"Great idea, but be prepared for overage charges I enjoyed Divvy. The bikes were well-maintained and in mostly decent locations. However, there are several issues you should be aware of in advance. 1) The TRANSIT app is awful. It is difficult to locate the nearest Divvy stations -- so you can drive 10 minutes looking for one. They aren't accurate and the app crashes more than any other app I have had. AND-- even drivers couldn't tell us where they are located. Thankfully, one gave us 2 off the book bikes until we found another station!2) The time starts rolling as soon as you get your bike. In a few cases, we unlocked on, then it took 2-3 minutes to get the second out. That time counts against you.3) At night, the stations aren't lit, so we drove around for 45 minutes just looking for one! (hence an overage charge). The bikes are great and hopefully the app will get better with time. I would do it again, but now I know where they are all located."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/24/2017,"Worth the $10! We took full advantage of our 24 hour rental (noon-noon) -- we used it over two days since it starts your time once you purchase a pass. Although the 30 minute limit is a challenge/slight inconvenience it was peanuts compared to paying much more for full rentals. There are so many bike stations throughout the metro area it's nearly impossible not to pass by one to re-up the 30 minute slot. Made getting through the city a breeze and allowed us to make incredible time to see more than we thought we could! Not all roads have bike lanes but the sidewalks are oversized which made riding them there safe and not a nuisance to walkers. PRO TIP: the 30-minute time limit is their money maker. Avoid paying extra by downloading the Transit App from smartphone App Store and buying a pass for Divvy there. This allows you to immediately get your unlock codes on your phone. Best part -- you can re-dock your bike and IMMEDIATELY get it back (or a different one) for 30 MORE minutes without paying overage. Sounds like a hassle, but because of how many docks there are it is very easy. Without doing this you could end up paying $102 for a single day rental! "
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/20/2017,"Not Necessarily for Tourists The $9.99 for an all-day pass caught our eye and my daughter and I decided to use the Divvy bikes to ride along the Lakefront Trail in Chicago. We got the first bike off the rack with no problem. We had issues with the codes provided for the second bike and it took us about 15 minutes to successfully unlock a bike. We ended up using the bikes for almost 5 hours. We loved Divvy bikes until we got home and saw a $156 charge on our credit card! I called Divvy only to discover that we did not understand how the all-day pass works. You need to use the bike in 30-minute intervals. You have to return the bike to a Divvy rack, located throughout the city, within 30 minutes of acquiring the bike! The pass gives you unlimited 30-minute intervals - maybe good for a Chicago commuter, but not ideal for a tourist. They were unwilling to negotiate the charge at first. After a threat to dispute the charge with my credit card company, Divvy agreed to a one-time 50% refund as a courtesy. Since the rental charge at another bike rental company would've been $40 per bike for all day, I was happy with this agreement. Be sure you understand the terms of the all-day bike pass!"
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/19/2017,"Getting the bike eats up limited time. No way to review charges The process for signing in and getting a code can be cumbersome and doesn't always work. When it works on the first try, its great. When it doesn't, it can take 10 min to get a bike. There is no way to review the charges. My cc charge was twice the $9.99 daily rate. I have no idea what the additional charges were for and have no way to dispute them. The instructions on the website are terrible. But when the bikes work, biking is great!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/14/2017,"Great App, Loved the Bikes but 30 check-in time too inconvenient I hadn't ridden a bike in years so I was very excited to be able to ride a bike with my family last weekend. I really loved the 'Transit' App which allowed me to sigh-up and pay in advance. This was really helpful when I arrived at the bike station. When I saw the line at the machine to pay I smiled and walked right pass to my choice of bike. Yes!!!The bikes were nice and easy to use. All the ones I saw were in good condition. However, I do have 'one' issue that will prevent me from using the program as a family outing again.The 30 minute time limit is too constraining to put it nicely. When starting, I would have to set a 30min timer on my iphone and watch it every so often as time passes fast. After 20 minutes expired, I would have to gather the family so we could find the nearest bike station and stop. Seems easy, but try that when you separate from your family. Ugh!!! If there's a way to avoid the 30 minute requirement, (without paying the extra fees) I will use the bikes again. If not, then I'll pass."
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/09/2017,"great idea, awesome bikes, scheming dishonest company with no customer service Bought 24 hour pass. Had lots of nice rides. About 6 hours into my 24 hours, the station I was at would NOT give me a bike. Code from app did not work. ""Pass not Valid"" So I tried the process through the terminal at the station. Did not work there either. Tried to call and customer service not available. Soooooo, my wife put hers back too and we walked. When I got ahold of someone later to ask for some credit on my card, I was told that they DO NOT GUARANTEE YOUR ACCOUNT WILL WORK. So you are paying for a pass which they reserve the right to deny at will, whenever. Divvy -""You should have called the help number on the terminal, they would have told you to try another nearby terminal""Me - ""I did, but customer service was not available""Divvy - ""Well you should have tried to call more.""SO, even though the terminal said ""pass invalid"" it really meant ""pass invalid at this station for unknown reasons but you can get a bike at another "" and I would have known that if I had made multiple customer service call attempts."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/06/2017,Horrible customer service and not clear rates Love the idea of this company but it is not practical for tourists and I think they take advantage of that. Read carefully the day pass contract. 9.95 for 30 min rides but if you don't dock the bike every 30 min they rack up the charges on your cc. Not practical to even ride along the lake and find a station to dock at in 30 minutes. So disappointed. When you call they are not helpful at at and kinda rude! Beware!
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/05/2017,"Divvy Bikes, no problems. Downloaded the Transit app and rented 4 bikes via Divvy for 24 hours to use for exploring the Navy Pier without any hiccups.  Extremely convenient!"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/05/2017,"Excellent bike sharing system, read the FAQ's first. I have read the last couple of reviews below and i can't see how by them not locking the bikes in correctly is a fault of Divvy? It has very clear instructions in the FAQ's stating that if you don't get a green light on the dock, then remove the bike and try again. The docks are not perfect because i saw people time and time again just slam them in and walk away without checking, I giggled to myself as i imagined their bank accounts emptying as well. My wife and i used the system for one day with 2 passes and didn't have a problem, always checked for the green light, sat in the shade to have a rest then grabbed the same 2 bikes and commenced our next 30 minutes, setting a timer for 25 minutes and using the App to locate the next docking station. We'll be using the bike share in Washington DC and New York as well.The unfortunate thing is that common sense is not so common these days!!A great system, even a couple of Aussies had to explain it to a few Americans.......who would have thought?"
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/01/2017,"Do not use!! Takes advantage of first time users  If you are a tourist visiting Chicago, do NOT use divvy. I'm a Chicago native and rented a 24 hour bike pass just to commute to work. I had never used the service before. Unfortunately when I returned the bike 20 minutes after renting it, evidently it ""didn't lock properly"" even though I was physically unable to remove the bike from the lock (I checked). Because of this, I was charged $80 for the time it took for an associate to notice the problem, even though I had returned the bike within the 30 min period. For reference, the annual pass is $99. I was so disappointed with the customer service and the exorbitant fee Divvy charged, especially when the name of the pass (24 hour pass) is extremely misleading for tourists. I would not recommend this service under any circumstances, because the mistake I made was impossible for a first time user to know, and it was extremely costly to do so. "
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/28/2017,Enjoyed the experience but lousy customer service Used the bikes to get from Buckingham Fountain to Navy Pier and back. Had a great time and enjoyed the ride. Less than 30 minutes each way. Imagine my surprise when my credit card billed came in at $132. Called the company and they found my rental. Stated their records showed a 6 hour bike ride and that we must have returned the bikes improperly. Flat out refused to refund any of my money. Absolutely lousy customer service. Will not be using the bikes in Chicago ever again. Would give less than a one rating if it existed.
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/27/2017,"What a great way to discover the 606, Millenium park and the lakeside. Ride 30 minutes, Dock the bike. Drink à coffre. Take another bike. Ride for 30 minutes. Dock it. Visit a site. All day long. Simple. Nice city to bike."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/26/2017,"Good first time experience My wife and I used Divvy Bikes to ride north on the lake path from our hotel near the Hancock Tower to the north end of Lincoln Park. We dropped off the bikes at Fullerton Avenue, then walked south via the Botanical Garden and Zoo, having a nice lunch at Café Brauer before picking up our return rides at North Avenue. It was a great way to enjoy the beautiful day and super cheap to boot."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/25/2017,Geat way to see Chicago/lake Michigan Bikes are available in many places around Lakeshore Blvd. $9.99 for daily rental. You do not have to return bike to same location at end of trip. Great way to see alot of lake area without walking. Bikes have adjustable seats and 3 gears. Well worth the price.
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/23/2017,Biking This is a great service for tourist. You rent a bike for 1 day and you get unlimited 30-minute bike rides in that one day. If you go over 30 minutes you get charged extra. There are docking stations all over. We rode from the beach to navy pier along the shoreline and loved it. Great experience! 
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/22/2017,"TERRIBLE AND MISLEADING BE CAREFULL!! The real you in with their ""24-hour pass"" making you believe you have 24 hours to ride around the city and enjoy the bike. Then a charge for an outrageous amount shows up on your credit card and you have no idea why. They fool people who don't read the fine print which says you have to return to a dock station every 30 minutes or you will be charged extra, a lot extra. Meanwhile, it takes 5-10 minutes to have the group all return and then repurchase their bikes each time. Their customer service also couldn't care less if you saw that caveat to their rental terms or not when you rented. Do not use this service until they change their terms!!!"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/14/2017,"Easy to use & tons of Divvy bike locations Recently used the Divvy Bikes downtown Chicago and they worked out really well. The bikes had three gears which was very helpful. We have rented in NYC too and I'm pretty sure only had one gear. Tons of pit stops to ""check-in"" every 30 minutes. There is also a tie-on the front of the bike that you can loop your water into/bag whatever. Would definitely rent again."
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/13/2017,Limited to 30 minute stretches Every half hour you have to check the bike in somewhere or get dinged for extra charges. kind of a cheap shot.
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/12/2017,Visiting my son in Chicago We both used divvy bikes to tour Chicago! We had a great time! So easy to get around and there are so many bike sites to park and ride! They are easy to operate and I would gladly use them on my next visit!
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/12/2017,Rip Off I ended up having to pay $45 for my 2.5hr ride because the rules were not clearly explained. Apparently every 30 minutes you have to turn the bike in and get out a new one. An employee even helped me fill out my information at the kiosk and he never explained this rule. Total rip off!!
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,06/11/2017,30 minute check in's are not convenient We enjoyed our rental but found the fact that you have to check in your bike every  30 minutes awkward. I have to reserve full review for when we get our bill.  Especially  after reading the other reviews and how customers got overcharged.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/08/2017,"Great Way to see the city! My boyfriend and I stayed in Hyde Park this past weekend and this was probably one of the best parts of our weekend! We rode the divvy bikes along the lake front and into the city, along the river, through the Gold Coast into the Old Town and up to Wrigleyville! We LOVED it! Such an amazing way to travel around the city and get a little exercise in! I would definitely recommend this to everyone!"
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/06/2017,"First time rider experience - Old style docking station/ Fraudulent charges June 2,2017 - I rented the bike for 24 hours for 9.95$/day. I made 4 short trips the same day. Each time, I made sure that bike was docked within stipulated 30 mins. Divvy charged 90$ fees on my card. When I called customer care to inquire, firstly the lady was not courteous, she said I rented the bike for over 4 hours 42 mins. When I mentioned that i did not look the bike out for too long, she said that I did not dock the bike properly in my second trip. She kept on insisting that it was my fault and would not listen to me . She asked me the color code that machine displayed, as if I will remember every second of the journey. After 20-30 mins of hold time, the supervisor offered me to take 50% refund, which I refused to.I will not ride the bike again & will not recommend it. Divvy is making money with dishonest ways. Their docking stations are old fashioned & they are perhaps not upgrading, so they can deceive daily riders. The supervisor mentioned there are no cameras on the stations and they trust their docking stations, which is hard to believe after the incident.I hope such complaints make it city of chicago & they look into the matter."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/02/2017,Be Very Careful Be very careful if you rent bikes from this company. I rented two bikes for less than 24 hours and was charged $113.00 instead of the roughly $20 it should have been. They claimed that one of the bikes was not docked properly even though I made sure they were locked in place. Divvy refuses to issue a refund. DO NOT USE THIS SCAM COMPANY.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/30/2017,"Handy, cheap service for exploring Chicago While visiting over Memorial Day Weekend my friends and I used the Divvy service, each purchasing a daily pass multiple times. Stations are conveniently located throughout the area we visited (Magnificent Mile & Gold Coast) and we seldom ran into issues where there weren't enough bikes for us. Sometimes the 30 minute timer is a little inconvenient, but it's easy to work with. This service functions MUCH better than the equivalent service in NYC"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/27/2017,Fun Ride on Lakeshore A group of eight rented the bikes and rode from the Navy Pier to Edgewater. Fun ride along the waterfront. A few glitches when checking in the bike every 30 minutes along with a few detours but overall was a lot of fun.
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/15/2017,Bikes  We really enjoyed traveling around Chicago on the bikes. Chicago has bike lanes. They can be tricky because you may think they are on one side of the street and they are on the other. We used the bikes a lot. It was well worth the 10$ all day. We only used bikes. No busses at all. Most of our docking stations were near the locations we were visiting. Happy Biking. 
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,04/30/2017,Great Biking in Chicago but Bike Stations Not Convenient I love to bike in cities and Chicago is a fabulous place because they have 18 miles of uninterrupted bike trails along the lake. However Divvy Bikes require you to check in every 30 minutes and when you get south of Soldier Field the bike stations are not along the lake front so you either have to cross streets or go well off the trail to dock your bike. If you choose not to dock (which we did) then you have to pay a surcharge which runs up your bill. You probably are better off renting from the bike rental place in Millennium Park and paying the day charge so you don't have to fool with the bike docking stations. If the check in was every hour it would be much better. Bikes were in decent condition and loved the ride.
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/18/2017,"Expect to pay way more than what is advertised False advertising. Do not go here if you think you can do a bike down the lake, or anything of significance in the city. We had a nice surprise waiting for us when we got back home on our credit card bill. If you actually want to enjoy the bike and experience go to another vendor (bike and roll, Bobby's bike hike). Despite fewer drop off locations, you could cab to these places, bike, cab home and still be cheaper then the crooks at divvy. Needless to say, a lot better bikes that are actually looked after and guaranteed to have them there, unlike divvy stations.Rule of thumb to spread around: If walking down the streets of Chicago, avoid the light blue bikes at all costs."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/10/2017,"Great way to see all of Downtown! My wife and I discovered the Divvy Bikes on our last day in Chicago. We still downloaded the app (very easy) and were on our way in less than 5 minutes. Great way to see the sites without walking all over the place or paying for an overpriced tour. Chicago is very bike friendly with tons of bike routes and parks to ride the bikes through. My wife and I were hesitant at first to ride through downtown on the bikes, but found ended up going anyways and we had a great time. There are Divvy Bike racks all over town and with the app they are easy to find and return the bikes. I would highly recommend renting the Divvy bikes while you are in Chicago!"
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/09/2017,"Crappy Service with a Crappy System DO NOT USE DIVVY BIKES!! This was the worst experience that I have had in a long time! I was completely screwed over by this company! I docked my bike at one of the stations (correctly, I might add) and the system didn't register that it was there. So, I had to go back and find the bike and re-dock it correctly, except it wasn't there! So I called Divvy and told them that the bike was gone, at which point they told me to call every hour and see if the bike was re-docked anywhere else. 30 hours later, after calling dozens of time, filing a police report for a missing bike, and getting told I was going to have to pay $1200 to replace the bike it was finally re-docked. I was left with a $100 charge on my credit card when it should have been $20. Needless to say, I will not use Divvy bikes again, Their system caused me horrible stress and $100 I did not owe them"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/02/2017,"Divvy across all of downtown We used Divvy bicycles to go all the way from Navy Pier to the Planetarium. You can access many of Chicago's attractions. Just make sure you keep track of where all the stations are. That way you can return your bike, and just take it out again."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,02/21/2017,"Easy access to bikes On a nice day, this is a wonderful way to see the city.  The station's were at every site we went to and bikes were in great condition.  And it save a fortune in cabs!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/29/2016,"Great fun - download the app! Great way to see the city. No real expertise needed - I hadn't been on a bike for years!The designated bike lanes are a helpful route guide.You do have to check in every 30 minutes. Finding these stations can be a little tricky in the busy city centre. We rode right past the one we were looking for! I assume that the app would help with this. Checking in seems a hassle but there is so much to see and experience in the city that the 30 minute rides are really all the time you need to get from 1 ""must see"" to the next.Credit card essential, you swipe at every check in point. Card is charged once for the day and then again only if you miss a 30 minute check in deadline - this can be an expensive mistake!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/27/2016,"A fun and exciting way to explore Chicago! My fiance and I used two bikes to ride along the Lake Michigan riverwalk from the Shedd Aquarium to the oak street beach. The bikes were in good condition and comfortable to ride. The process to rent the bikes out and then dock them when finished is easy. I have two issues keeping me from giving 5 out of 5. I dislike that the only option/""plan"" is to pay $10 per bike for a 24 hour pass. The other issue is that you have to dock your bike every 30 minutes or else you get charged an additional amount, which depends on how much longer you had between docking beyond 30 minutes. Our ride took 40 minutes and so we were charged an extra $2 per bike for going 10 minutes over. The real kicker is that we were unable to use the bike service in the next 24 hours because we had pre planned most of our trip. All in all, I paid $24 to rent two bikes for 40 minutes. It's not gonna break my bank but it's frustrating that there is no other option for rent duration. We still loved the service though!"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/12/2016,"Such a great way to see the city. I would highly recommend this for anyone. It is not only economical, but in many instances it is faster than driving to many locations. The city has done a great job of catering to cyclists and lanes and even dedicated street lights."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/09/2016,Exploring Chicago with Divvy The Transit app sucks but with the help of Citymapper and Divvy we had really awesome Chicago experience.
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/05/2016,"Best transport in Chicago  We've used city bike programs in the past but for the first time, there are enough stations to truly make this replace other public transport, a car or even uber- all of which is actually much slower let alone more expensive. Locals probably get year memberships but visitors can get one day passes $9.95 which gives you unlimited 30' or less rides. Rides over 30' costs extra, but Chicago center is a small (relatively) manageable city for a visitor most stations are less then 4 mi apart. The stations near big attractions like Millennium Park may be low on bikes but just wait and people start dropping them off. You have to use the same credit card at each station to identify yourself and get a new code. Bike codes unlock the bike. The few downsides: no helmet rental so BYOH and the kiosks don't respond well to touch as they should. The bikes are heavy and durable and are the step in kind - unisex. They fit most any height - I'm less than 5' and the hubs 6'. We used them to go from Lincoln Park, to 3 locations downtown, to Old Town and to different areas of lincoln Park. All easy. Good roads. Night lights in the front res blinkers in the back. Importantly - download CHI Bike app and it will always tell you the closest station as well as a map of all stations. Pretty convenient. "
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/26/2016,Convenient  Probably the most convenient way to go back to the hotel from the McCormick or to spend some time discovering the city.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/25/2016,"Loved it! Chicago's is amazingly bike-friendly, and Divvy is a great way to enjoy it. There's stations pretty much everywhere. The only drawback for me was the fairly high price for a 24h pass of $9.95, but I found a promo code through Transit App which knocked it down to $7."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/25/2016,"Was my favorite thing I did in Chicago. As others have said, you can rent for 24 hours for $10, but that means you have to check in the bike every 30 minutes. It's intended to be a commuter bike experience, not a long-term bike rental. We had no luck getting the bikes using the station, called customer service and they suggested using the transit app. That worked! The stations are close together and easy to find. It's so much fun to ride along the lake."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/24/2016,"Excellent availability of bikes, quality of bikes. Cost and payment system could be better Bike stations are never too far away and the 30 minute limit is long enough in Chicago to do almost all of the hops that we wanted to do. All of the bikes we rented save one was in excellent working order and there was no problem to swap out for another in that case.Only feedback we would have is that there was no longer term deal - the 24 hour option we used 4 days in a row and it felt like we should have got some kind of a deal on that. More seriously the credit card system was not working properly and after getting three messages saying the system had timed out, later found that I had been charged each time so will of course be requesting this is reimbursed."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/23/2016,"Renter beware Divvy has rent all day for 9.95. I didn't notice you have to dock bikes every 30 minutes. Was overcharged. When I went to customer service they said I didn't read and can't get it adjusted. Okay I realize it was my fault but I never rented a bike not read fine print. No great customer service, bad clunky bikes, and just out for making a buck. Crappy business. "
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/15/2016,"Best part of the trjp Biked down lakeshore drive with a couple of friends using the divvy bikes was such an ease. What made it even easier was not having to wait in line for a new code for a new bike because we just requested one on the transit app! Wow, definitely coming back and doing the same thing. 10/10 would recommend."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,10/12/2016,"Fun way to get along the lake In town to watch someone run the marathon. It's $9.95 for 24 hours of rental but is you use it for more than 30 minutes at a time they start dinging your credit so you need to check the bike in at least every 30 minutes which can be a bit of a hassle.Also we arrive at a few few destinations and there were no empty spaces, fortunately we had time to find another location, but that could have been a headache."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/04/2016,Best way to get around Chicago My husband and I used Divvy for 2 days of our 3 day trip! It was quick and easy - they had docks wherever we went!
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/01/2016,Cheaper to Purchase a New Bike I wish I could give a rating of zero stars. I rented a bike near St. Francis Hospital so that I could go visit my aunt who was in from out of town. I purchased the 24 hour unlimited ride rental. Good deal right? NO. DON'T EVER RENT A BIKE FROM DIVVY. It's a scam. You can rent as many bikes from DIFFERENT docks for the 24 hour rate in 30 minute increments. That rule is supposedly displayed in fine print on the screen. Should that be written in BOLD on the bike and the kiosk? It cost me $109 to rent a bike for 8 hours. I should have purchased a bike and given it away when I was finished. Does Trump own DIVVY?
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/24/2016,Divvy all day ! Get the app ($2 coupon) and helps to ease your docking and undocking. Chicago is a great place to bike around and these bikes are solid. Be sure to wear a watch so that you can watch your time (30 min. a ride) but you can easily just doc and undoc again and keep riding. I am hoping that I made all my time limits and don't find an additional charge on my credit card ! It did seem easy and you meet fun people docking and undocking ! Get your first bike early and ride all day !
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,09/22/2016,"Fun bike ride; disappointed with the final cost Beautiful September day to bike the city. Quite the adventure weaving through crowds of people on a Sunday afternoon, meandering through cars and taxi drivers and walking our bikes across Navy pier. Those experiences are fun memories. However, what puts a bad taste in my mouth is the charge to my credit card: $39 instead of the $9.95 for the day, or two total hour ride. The fine print instructs you to ""return"" your bike every thirty minutes to a docking station to keep the price at $9.95 for the day. If we did this our memorable experience would have been a nightmare instead. I would've rented bikes from Bobby's Bike Hike for the same price and gotten a better bike if I read the fine print. Just keep this in mind when you plan your trip."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/19/2016,"Poor customer service Great option to get around using the lake front trail while visiting Chicago (BUT you should be warned that there are tons of races on the trail during the weekend). However, my first code didn't work. Got another. Finally got a bike and the seat was broken (dropped down within 2 min or riding). Stopped at the next station and returned my bike to get a new one....except after I returned it the comp didn't work. Called customer service and they told me to walk to the next station....while my time using it is ticking away. I asked for a discount due to he multiple calls made to customer service, inconvenience of their system and bike(s) not working, and reduced time actually being able to use the bike and was refused.I love the concepts of bikes in the big city and have done this in Denver and Boston previously. However, I would never use this company again."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/19/2016,"Divvy round the Lake edge Rented a couple of Divvy bikes to explore around the Lake front in Chicago while visiting our son who lives in Streeterville. I love this concept of 24 hour membership and free rental. The stations' spacing makes it easy to get to destination without having to go over the 30 minute free rental. For longer destination, its easy to stop at station and quickly check same bike out for continued ride and another 30 minutes free. Did this in DC recently and had a similar good time. The bikes are heavy though and have limited top end gearing so that 15 mph is about as fast as you'll cruise, even if you're a strong biker. The three speed shifters have all worked well and allow for easy slow speed take offs and climbs. Easy quick-release post allows for quick seat adjustment (remember, about a 90% leg extension is about what you should be aiming for to allow the best efficiency.) The tire pressure has been good on all the bikes I've tested and subsequently chosen fir each trip.No helmets is the one down side to the system. I hope this concept is taken to every major metropolitan city in the world. We have a good one in my hometown, Denver but i haven't tried it here cuz this is where my bikes live with me."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/19/2016,"Good quality Positive: lots of stations around the city, easy to use application, good quality bikes;
Negative: application doesn't work offline"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/17/2016,"Awesome!!! LOVE these bikes. Easy to use, convenient, fast, fun, exciting, the app is awesome, etc. Can't say enough good things about it. We loved using these bikes to get around the city to explore, shop, travel, etc. Will definitely do it again. Wish all cities had these."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/16/2016,"Fantastic idea Great way to get around the city. YOu get 30 minutes per trip but it's $10 for a 24 hour period and they have bike racks everywhere and the app is pretty accurate telling you where to find them.We grabbed one in the morning by the river and woudl boke down to the field or to navy pier or up north and then drop it off. Then come back out and grab another. You do have to be brave to ride in the downtown streets. Sidewalks are crowded and although we did ride on them on occassion, it's not ideal most of the time."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/12/2016,"Best way to get around...except in winter I've been a key-carrying member since the bike share service began in Chicago. I have used Divvy bikes for basic downtown commuting. I feel like a grannie sitting on the ample seat but they're certainly solid machines. The 2 biggest complaints I have are with the ""basket,"" a metal brace with bungee straps. And, I've ridden too many bikes with gear slip problems.But these shortcomings aren't enough to dissuade me from using the service anytime I'm in the city. There are nifty apps that give you the number of open bike stalls and the number of available bikes...very important when it's a high demand part of the day.I just re-upped my subscription and I'm glad TripAdvisor is allowing me to share my thoughts.Unless you're a passing-through traveler...buying an annual subscription for unlimited use is the best way to go. And...bring your helmet."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/11/2016,"Loved this! This was great for us as there are stations all over the place. Not too keen on the 30 minute check in as we are tourists and wanted to stop and smell the roses a bit. Lots of great things about this program especially the Divvy Dudes that were nearby to give tourist assistance. One guy, Danny Drinkwater, was so helpful and a pleasure to interact with as we had no idea what we were doing. What a great ambassador for the program!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/11/2016,Nice Cruising Ride While the family went to the American Girl store I cruised from Hyatt McCormick Place along the lakefront.  I rode at a leisurely pace to Navy Pier and back seeing Grant Park and Buckingham Fountain.  This was a memorable part of my trip.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/07/2016,"HIGHLY recommend!! Guys.... Get these bikes!!!!! We had such an amazing times over 2 days riding around the city. We hired for 24 hours, picked them up at 1.30pm so had all afternoon and all next morning over the Labor Day weekend. Perfect."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/07/2016,No issues Great experience. The mobile app was easy to use. Payment was easy. Bike retrieval was easy. Did I mention it was fun?
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/07/2016,"Hit a SNAG! We wanted to rent bikes near Navy Pier for a ride to the Adler. When we got to the stand, there were only 2 bikes (we needed 3) and those were broken. We walked to the next stand which said there was 8 bikes available. We get there and while there are 5 bikes, they are all broken or not able to be undocked. It felt like many people did not understand how the system worked either. The vans that maintain the docking areas were not on top of their game this day. While it is a great idea, I think a little more public education of the idea is necessary as is the maintenance of the bikes and docking facilities"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/04/2016,"Easy Fun Transportation  I have always wanted to try Divvy Bikes downtown and this weekend finally had a reason too. I was traveling around Chicago with my husband and realized divvy bikes would allow us to get all offer much quicker. I had never used this before and it was so easy! You pay $9.95 for 24 hours if you use the bikes at 30 minutes intervals. (If you use for longer you either pay a little bit extra or stop and exchange before your 30 minutes is up). There are a lot of locations and easy driving bikes, especially along the lake shore."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/04/2016,"Epic Labor Day Weekend FAIL Systems down & ineffective operating. Didn't recognize bike being turned in, wouldn't let us check out bike, system down & wouldn't let us do anything. Divvy tech guy at Field was zero help except to suggest we walk to next station and wait for someone to check in a bike. Customer service number at least had a live person but confirmed the two closest stations were empty of bikes. Oh, and app does not show all the stations apparently. Next time we'll rent a bike for the day and do away with this massive time suck!"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/30/2016,"Chicago's Diivy Bike Share is great!! I enjoyed using the Diivy Bike so much. Using it to ride along the Lakeshore Drive trail was absolutely one of my favorite parts of my trip to Chicago!!Using the recommended Transit app in conjunction with the bike rental was vital to me. It was very intuitive, fast, and easy to use and I was so happy it was available. I found it to be accurate in terms of alerting me to the number of Bikes and return docks available at each station around Chicago, which was a blessing in terms of helping me determine which dock was nearest with the most Bikes (for me to start my ride) and how far I should ride to if I needed an extended trip (based on where Bikes were most available to restart my 30 minutes). I would not have been able to utilize the Diivy with as much success and satisfaction as I could have without the Transit app. Getting a new code was so fast that I didnt even have to unload my stuff from a bike I was returning in order to take it right out again. It was so great. I would avoid trying to get a bike from the downtown area/loop area around rush hour/ sundown. It's difficult."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/29/2016,Highly recommend We had such a great time on our bikes.  Never any problems finding a bike or a place to drop them off when we were finished.  Perfect way to see Chicago.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/24/2016,"Great way to see the lake front My first trip to Chicago and I decided to bike around rather than walk. Divvy rocks! they are so easy to use and are spaced out well. And cheap! Insider tips: 1) Check in with your same credit card if trading in every 30 minutes (do it, its easy) 2) Use them on the Lakefront trail - such a special way to see the Lake and beautiful green area!"
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/21/2016,"Disappointing experience/complete waste of money I was REALLY excited to rent bikes to ride along the lakeshore with my family. I was willing to go through the hassle of finding a docking station every half hour to ensure we weren't charged penalty fees. However, at our first stop, about 20 minutes into ride, we were unable to retrieve all of our bikes. We had rented 6 bikes and 2 of them would never unlock with the code given. We tried other bikes. There was another group at this station with the same problem. I even tried to purchase additional ride passes but that didn't work either. So, the 4 on bikes rode back to where we started and 2 walked back. I would recommend just renting a bike for a period of time from a business and knowing you'll have it. It may cost a little more, but it's guaranteed to not be a hassle."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/19/2016,"Recommended, but can be better  We highly recommend to use Divvy bikes for visiting Chicago. You really get the most of the city by biking the same for north to south by the coast. The positive about Divvy is that it actually allows you to do that, and it is plenty of stations.The bike status is not the best, specially gear and hand grips. "
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,08/16/2016,"Divvy Your way to the Game If you read the other review some are great some are not. Know what you are getting into. 30 minute windows for 24 hrs. It worked great for us, we had the app, generally knew our way around town. Our biggest plus was going from downtown up to Wrigley and back downtown. However, we got halfway up town in 25 mins so put away the bikes and went to Dairy Queen for 10 mins. We got the same bikes out again and continued on our way. We did encounter stations that didn't have 3 bikes, We did encounter stations that had busted bikes. We did do a fair amount of walking to get to stations at times. A huge plus was the 2 am ride home when it was finally cool enough to ride."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/13/2016,Blue Bike Hire The Divvy Bikes (aka blue bikes)were a fabulous way to get around Chicago. Loved my self tour. 18miles of bike track.
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,08/07/2016,"Convenient but clunky Divvy bikes are a great idea in concept, but the bikes could be lighter weight and smoother to ride. In conjunction with the app, it was easy to find the stations and it's a healthy, fun way to see Chicago along the lakefront. The lakefront path can be quite congested, however. We also had an issue at one station where the rack wouldn't release the bike and had to walk to another one. Overall though a great idea!"
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/06/2016,"DO NOT rent divvy Waste of money, waste of time. 1. You must insert credit card at a docking site every 30 minutes to avoid fine print fees. 2. As tourists who don't know the city, good luck finding docking station (the app is useless if you're a tourist) 3. Any Roads with bike lanes were used by cars (very few roads actually had bike lanes-i.e. You have to walk your bike on the sidewalk) 4. Sidewalks too crowded for bikes.5. Dock your bike and slide your credit card for a new bike code and then watch someone walk off with your bike. Now you get to hike all the way to the next docking station. OR have someone stay with your docked bikes as one of you gets a new code. 6. Sketchy detour to get to waterfront path near Navy Pier.7. Spent 98% of the time walking the bike. 8. When you find another station for get a new bike, STAY WITH YOUR BIKE to get a new code. People will steal your bike. The bike must be docked in order to get a new code. 9.What a waste. Walk where you are going. Much faster! You spend your entire 30 minutes searching for a kiosk to avoid fees and keep the $9.95 price. Zero time to leisurely enjoy the waterfront. (Beware: waterfront kiosks will most likely be empty, so guard your bike when you dock for new code or it WILL be taken)  Tips if you still want to do it:TEST BRAKES FIRSTSet watch with a timer of 25 min to avoid fees Ask for printed receipt (your code disappears off the screen VERY quickly) Best tip: Don't do it. "
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/04/2016,"LOOKING TO GET AROUND THE CITY, DIVVY BIKES ARE A GOOD CHOCIE Just like a lot on major cities around the U.S. bikes are becoming the norm and Chicago has it's own to offer. So if you want to get around the city jump on a rental Divvy Bike and enjoy the ride."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/04/2016,"Economical way to bike the lake! Ah, I loved the to feel the breeze through my hair as I pedaled along. We had a brilliant time biking on the bike trail along the lakefront. We'd also planned to bike up to Lincoln Park, but the weather had other ideas. The Divvy Bikes seemed to be located all over the city and the pricing scheme made it the cheapest touristy thing we did in The Windy City ($9.95 per bike for 24 hours as long as we returned the bike in 30 minute intervals, but we could check out as many bikes as we wanted within the 24 hour period.) It was brilliant as long as the Divvy Bike rental place you wanted to return your bike to wasn't full (then you'd have to find another spot). Slightly lift the bike to get it out of the docking slot and don't be too gentle when shoving it back in, so it clicks. "
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/03/2016,"TOURISTS BEWARE! This is a huge scam! Avoid these bikes. As you can see from several other reviews, basically you get screwed with the small print. You look & see $9.95 for 24 hours so you rent the bike. What you don't realize is that lower on the kiosk it says that if you don't dock the bike EVERY 30 mins, fees will apply. We rented 2 bikes for 4 hours & I got a $127 charge on my card! When you call CS, they tell you the bikes are made for short commuter trips that take no more than 30 mins. And if you want it for 24 hrs, you have to dock it every 30 mins. Divvy, let me ask you, who would rent a bike for TWENTY FOUR hours if they had to constantly dock it?? It doesn't even make sense. If you have to dock it every 30 mins, then only rent it out for THIRTY MINUTES. As a tourist, you don't know the city, we got lost several times & finally when we saw a docking station, we gave up after 4 hours. Not as easy to bike around a city you don't know as it seems. But we didn't mind since it was only $9.95. WRONG. I called CS and asked for a manager, I spoke with a manager who was very polite & eventually refunded me 50%, which means I got charged $54 for something I thought would cost me $20. I said to him, ""You can't tell me that you don't get this call once or more everyday from other tourists."" And he pretty much agreed it is a huge problem. He's even suggested to Divvy to change their kiosks. Divvy, this is criminal behavior. You need to make your fees MUCH CLEARER. Maybe don't make $9.95 for 24 hrs so bold. You are taking advantage of people who come to rent a bike for a day & get financially taken for a ride as well. Make it clear, Divvy is for LOCALS who want a quick ride. This is not tourist friendly."
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/02/2016,"Worst. Customer. Service. Ever. I ride the bike share all the time in DC and love it. Concept is great. Same concept is great in Chicago too. The big difference is, as a tourist in Chicago, you have to purchase a daily pass. The process is a bit tedious, sliding your credit card in and out at the kiosk each time. Often times you have to do it more than once because the reader cannot process your card. I found several kiosks out of service so you couldn't check out another bike.Then the doozy hit. I docked a bike and walked around a bit in Grant park and grabbed some breakfast early one morning. Went to check out another bike and the kiosk said my bike was still out. Worst. Customer. Service. Ever. Was basically told to go back and find my bike and re-dock it because it wasn't properly docked. Was advised by the Divvy Customer Service rep that she does not work for Divvy so she can't address my account or other issues. Was given the bike number and told to look under the seat.Walked 1/1 mile back to dock. Looked at about 8 bikes until I found the one I docked. It was locked in like a baby. Called customer service again. Same representative. Acted like we had never spoken although it was only 10 minutes prior. How many people had she spoken to on a Tuesday morning at 10am? Rrefreshed her memory and she said 'oh yeah'. Told her bike was docked and gave her the name of the dock. Explained it 3 times, spelled the street. (Where are they located????). She said it looks like dock is offline. When it comes online I will note the bike as docked. So, now what? How do I get a bike? Will I get credit for the time you think my bike is out.... so many unanswerable questions by the woman who doesn't work for Divvy.Suffice it to say, I ended up walking 2 miles back to my hotel because the rep gave me a code that didn't work and I just couldn't handle calling back and talking to her again.God bless and good luck if you rent a Divvy bike and something happens. Waiting for some massive charge to hit my credit card and maybe I'll be lucky enough to talk to the same disinterested, condescending ""I don't work for Divvy"" customer service rep.Oh, an I wrote an email to Divvy customer service, the email address on their website. Wait for it... No response.It would be a 1, except the concept is a good idea. I pity the fool with an offline dock."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/30/2016,"Great way to get around the city, and lake As a tourist this was a great way to do the Lakefront Trail and to see the city. Chicago seems to be one of the few cities that has bike lanes where you can actually fit and not have the fear of being ran over. Only problem is that sometimes it could be difficult to find a place to drop off your bike within 30 minutes (if doing the all day pass) due to sometimes the bike rack being full. Also, it would be nice after downloading the app you could get reminders to drop off your bike, or even have a place for your phone so you can follow the gps to your destination. Overall, we had a great experience."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/25/2016,"Overall Great, Some Annoyances While Divvy bikes are a great concept for those who live in Chicago, for those of us traveling through/visiting, there were some annoyances that I tried to look past. I downloaded the app to my phone, bought the $9.95 day pass, but was told halfway through the day that I hadn't purchased said pass. So then I had to re-purchase a pass using the same exact credit card and ultimately had to dispute the second charge to the CC company.Since Divvy bikes are for ""short trips"", you have to dock the bike every 30 mins to avoid being charged. We tried setting an alarm for every 25 mins so we could find a Divvy station to re-dock the bike and go through the whole process all over again of retrieving an unlock code, or you risk being charged for going over. There is, of course, an option to add on more time by paying more when purchasing your day-pass. Since I was trying to save on cash, this is why we chose to dock (or at least try to dock) every thirty minutes. Half-way though the day, we just gave up and said screw it, and just kept the bikes for however long we needed it. It was better to enjoy our time that way instead of worrying we couldn't find the next station.Most of the bikes were rideable, some had obvious signs of wear-and-tear, some we couldn't take out because they were reported as ""damaged"" (and therefore you cannot unlock said bike). I would have liked to see a basket on the front and someplace to keep my water bottle secure. There is a little bungee cord on the front so you can place something there, but it won't fit anything as large as a backpack.Yes, I would use these again. Yes, I would purchase more time when I buy the day pass. Ultimately, you get a good view of the city by bike, a good workout, and it's better than Chicago having no bikes at all!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/25/2016,"Quick trip  I gave it a 4 only because the seats aren't comfortable enough to be riding all day. By the end of the day we couldn't tolerate the soreness. I couldn't imagine trying to use the bikes for more than a day unless your butt gets used to it. On the other hand, it was such a nice way to get around and make quick trips. You also get to explore more of the city this way. Very easy to access with the app (transit). "
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/25/2016,"Poor Service Went to the kiosk to get two bikes. My friend just before me got a bike for himself. However, when I tried it would not allow me to get the bikes. I tried three different cards, one of which was the same as my friends. When we called customer service, they said there was nothing they could do."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/25/2016,So Awesome! Traffic has been very accommodating to my lack of bike riding skills - Coming from a small southern town in Louisiana where we have no public transportation much less bike lanes it was a little scary at first ... And I haven't ridden a bike in OMG maybe 30 years!! I'm still figuring the bike system out - but seems like the most economical way to get around and a lot of fun. I find the transit map a little confusing but it could be me!! I stop and ask for help - everyone is so nice! Be patient and bike on
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/24/2016,"Best way to explore the city If you're physically able, a $10 daily Divvy bike is an awesome way to explore the city. The downside is you can only keep them for 30 minutes at a time, but it wasn't as daunting after our first 30 minute segment spent riding up the lakeside path. Download the Transit App (as of this version, it's green and like a sideways S) which tracks EVERY version of public transportation but is great for the Divvy. Not only does it show all of the numerous bike stations, but it keeps track of how many bikes are available. So, you grab your day permit, it gives you a simple code, unshackle a bright blue Divvy, and off you go exploring. There are plenty of bike stations in the downtown area, no more than 5 blocks apart I'd guess. And bike lanes everywhere. And downtown is not very hilly at all. The best thing is you can turn in a Divvy at one end of a neighborhood, stroll a few blocks enjoying the city, then you use the same credit card as your membership to get a new code and a new bike. One word to the wise - downtown is full of cars, taxis, users, city buses, tour buses, and especially pedestrians. If you're not a confident bike rider, use caution on the busiest roads, like Michigan Ave! "
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/23/2016,"Vacation Chicago 2016 My wife and I enjoyed an evening out with a nice bike ride. We rode from our hotel (Drake) to the Navy Pier. We are both in are 50s and don't ride bikes back home but had no problems with these bikes, as they are easy to use and has easy shifting of gears. You do need to find the drop of locations at the places you ride to that gave us a little trouble but overall it was a fun experience. "
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/21/2016,"WAs way over charged for a 4 hour ride even though we paid for 24 hrs We visited Chicago and figured the best way to see the city and not fight parking was to bike. We got home and for renting 3 bikes for 4 hours we were charged $150. We could have used to tour bus and boats for that price!!! They scam you saying you rent a bike for 24 hrs for $9.95 but if you dont spend every 30 min searching for a new bike station to put it up, re-insert your card, get a new code and bike you get over charges. Who spends their whole day sight seeing going terminal to terminal? WILL NEVER USE AGAIN!!"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/20/2016,"So easy to use! We rented the bikes for the daily fee, and rode along the lake trail, very user friendly, all the docking stations were close enough to each other so we avoided extra fees by docking every 30 min. The bikes rode nicely, brakes worked well, adjustable seats, and bells!!! A very pleasant way to explore the lake trail in Chicago."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/18/2016,"Lots of fun with a big surprise! I loved the convenience of being able to rent a pair of bikes for $10/day! We rode bikes all day for about 7 hours. We stopped once to have a great lunch at the grand lux. Perfect! Couldn't believe what a great deal we had. Here's the big surprise!!! Noticed on my bank statement my charge was $143! I called to let them know a mistake was made, but surprise, no mistake. Turns out the $20/day for the pair was just so you could ride the bikes for up to 30 minutes at a time (you could swap for another bike at another location). Since we kept the same bikes for hours we accrued penalties. I asked to see if they could waive some of the fees to no avail. I felt bad that I misunderstood the policy since I am usually pretty savvy, but am posting this as a cautionary tail for future travelers. "
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/12/2016,"Rip Off - Divvy has no standards or policies or management I have used divvy for over a year, and have been generally content with the experience.HOWEVER, one night a divvy station was down for some reason, so the bikes were not locking into the dock. My friend and I both did our best to dock them and then immediately notified customer service of the issue. Later on we were both charged $75 for the time our bikes were ""out"". We both requested a refund because the issue was not our fault and we had notified Divvy. My friend easily received his refund, but after a dozen emails and calls I was denied a refund. Somehow Divvy is treating two identical situations in different ways. I am speechless at how awful this experience has been."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/11/2016,"Lakefront Route Awesome experience, we took a 14 mile trek along the lakefront and was able to seamlessly return and check out the same bike on a Saturday morning from 9-12 PM. I could see myself using Divvy for several other experiences when visiting the city of Chicago. I was surprised at how well the gears shifted (turn right hand grip forward or backward to shift gears), the light weight feel and the handling. It had no problem keeping up with a $700 Trek bicycle..."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/06/2016,"Easy, Fun & Fast First experience using city bikes. The Divy was easy to use, fast and fun. You can spend the whole day using the bikes for only $10. We saw all of Chicago on the bikes bc it's a bike friendly city. I strongly recommend this. And you can use your phone to make it even easier."
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/06/2016,"Misleading Policy; Day Pass = 30 minute trips ONLY Please note this is a ""commuter service"". Charges are COMPLETELY MISLEADING at the kiosk. A ""Day Pass"" only allows you to use a bike FOR 30 MINUTES. After that you pay overage charges. Good for a quick trip to get somewhere, but forget riding along the lake or stopping for lunch. We rented 2 bikes, rode along the lake and stopped for lunch. Had 2 bikes for one hour and 45 minutes. Cost us $50."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/05/2016,"Horrible To rent the bikes is easy. However, we thought we would have a 24 hour rental for the $20 fee. BUT...what they don't tell you is that you have to ""check it in"" every 30 minutes in order to avoid overage charges. So, getting on the bike is easy but then once you have biked for a while, we were in a panic to get to another bike station so that we wouldn't get charged. We had to put the bike back, and then get another bike code to ride for another 30 minutes. Wouldn't do it again."
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/05/2016,"No more divvying for us! Rented four bikes. The first 3 bikes released fine - we were on phone for 10 minutes until other was solved-released. Next day - we tried getting two of the four bikes (within the 24 hours). Again just one released and was back on phone with Divvy, twice. You get charged for this. The station at Navy Pier had no kiosk and the divvy station at McClurg had no available spots to park. Plus side - the bikes are a nice ride. Frustration not worth the $$$$. "
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/05/2016,"Small print schemes Hello. I recently took a Divvy ride down the Lake Shore trail in Chicago. This is a ride that takes a couple hours to do, depending on your speed and your distance. In any case, Divvy charges by the half hour. When going to pay the $10 for the 24 hour pass, the machines explicitly indicated the price. However, in the fine print section of the screens, they include a clause that indicates that one must dock the bike every 30 minutes, presumably for some sort of ""check in"". I did not see this clause as it was discreetly hidden in the fine print and received a bill for $80 the next day. This is not really acceptable for tourists in that they must pretty much be going station-to-station and checking in every half hour, rather than enjoying the ride and beautiful weather that Chicago boasts in the summertime. Also, it's a bit dangerous having to check every destination point in a city that may not be familiar to tourists. In the end, I was not helped by customer service neither by email nor telephone as the fine print pricing was much more accurate than the deceptive large print pricing that misleads customers as to really knowing how long to expect their rides to be. Don't be surprised if it happens that you get an incredibly expensive bill with conditions that are included in print like a Ponzi scheme."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/01/2016,"Not that bad Decided to try the bikes on a recent trip from Lake View to McCormick. The price is reasonable and the bikes were in good shape. It was easy to access them. You don't have to worry about locking them as you simply drop them in a station when you are close to where you want to spend time. I would say that the app is a must. If you do not visit a Divvy station every thirty minutes, the costs will pile on. But the app does a good job reminding you when there is 5 mins left and points you to the next closest station. When you do return to a station to reset the 30 minute clock, simply reinsert the bike into the station and dip the same credit card you used to get the bikes. There machine gives you a new release code and you are good for another 30 minutes. Also, if you get to a station and there are no empty spots, you simply dip your card and it gives you an extra 15 mins. All in all, it was an affordable way to get around the city and if you don't mind having to stop every 30 minutes, it's worth it!!"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/28/2016,"How to get the most of your Divvy experience Divvy is a great way to see Chicago. Pick your bike here and leave it there. All that for $9.95 for 24 hours + trip fees. The first 30 minutes are free and the first 60 minutes cost $2. After that you are getting into bigger bucks, e.g. 90 minutes for $6.To stop the clock you need to dock your bike at any station. And you can check out the very same bike that you just checked in.- To check out a bike. Since time is money, get the bike ready first: adjust the seat height, put your items in the front basket... Then enter your code. If you plan to ride with someone, enter your code simultaneously. Once you get a green light, the easiest way to undock a bike is to lift it up by its saddle.- To check it in. First verify the station you want to go to has empty docks via the Divvy app. Once you are at an empty dock, roll the bike in and lift slightly the handlebar until you see the green light on the left side of the dock station. That's CRITICAL. If the bike is not checked in correctly, the clock is still running and you will not be able to check out another bike.- 30 free minutes Vs. $2 for 60 minutesIt may be a better deal to pay $2 and get 60 minutes of riding than try to dock every 30 minutes. 60 minutes give you more range and allow you to get to your real destination. Of course, if you see a Divvy station along the way, dock your bike by all means. To get the most value, map your route first even before checking out any bike. The Divvy app can help you do that.- Practice docking/undocking Since the first 30 minutes are free, hold down your horses and spend 5 minutes to practice docking and undocking at your very first station. Then take off.- Last but not least do not ride on sidewalks. It is against the law, annoys pedestrians and gives Divvy a bad rap.Keep these tips in mind while you are enjoying your rides around town(s). In Summer 2016 Divvy is expanding to Oak Park & Evanston."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/27/2016,"Super convenient! Ir you want to know Chicago do it on a Divvy, what a great service and an easy and reliable app to rent them for a day, I did all my trip on the bikes, always found a station nearby and never had a problem."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/26/2016,"Be forewarned about this company! Be warned that 9.95 for 24 hours does not mean you get the bike for 24 hours! You only get it for 30 minutes before you have to redock it, and recheck it out otherwise you get charged overage fees! Sure this is explained on the website and/or app, but it is not well explained if you just show up and rent a bike on the fly. Our family rented bikes (4 of them) and got hit with very hefty overage fees because this wasn't well explained at the kiosk. So hopefully others will read this and be forewarned!"
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,06/12/2016,"Are you on a budget or tight schedule?  Then you might not wish to use Divvy Bikes It SOUNDS like a great idea, but..........beware.  You must re-dock every 30 minutes, or incur an additional charge.  If a station is full, you'll have to bike to the next closest one.   Or the next closest one after that.  And so on......."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/10/2016,Horrible!!! Great concept horrible executuon!!!  Stations not working customer service not helpful. Ruined our day walking trying to fund a working station!
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/07/2016,"Excellent way to get around Ok, it's a bit of a hassle to set up the system but persevere as the bikes are a great way to get around and see the sights. I cycled from the conference centre all along the lake from to the top of the magnificent mile in less than 30min. Then took another bike later up to Lincoln Park along the lake shore. The bikes are easy to ride, in good condition and there is a really good map on line which shows the network of cycle paths. "
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/04/2016,"Biking in Chicago We had a lot of fun biking along the lake shore on our recent trip to Chicago. I want to caution others to be careful about the return of their bikes. It can be tricky to get your bike locked in so the time meter stops. I had a charge of over $110.00 on my debit account when I got home, for less than two hours of biking. I called the company and to their credit they did give me a partial refund."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/01/2016,"Bummer! Broken Pay Machine! When trying to pay and have a ride outside the Shed Aquarium, we were told the payment machine was broken, AND when the gentleman involved called to ask for help, he was told they, the company, could not do anything! We will try to ""Bike and Roll"" closer to our hotel tomorrow! Sounds like fun!!"
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/23/2016,It's a RIP OFF!!! You might as well buy a bike for this price! It's such a rip off and the pricing is not very clearly stated. We thought that we would pay $9.95 for the 24 hour pass plus $8 to not have to keep docking it every 30min. Wow were we wrong! It's 9.95 plus $8 if you have it for up to 90min plus $8 for each additional 30min. My card was charged $63 for couple hours of divvy. DO NOT USE IT!
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/11/2016,"Avoid the Nightmare of Renting a Divvy Bike, can be costly and very frustrating!!! We tried to use a Groupon on 3 bikes and what a nightmare for several reasons: The system to check out bikes is too lengthy even without the Groupon. I could only use 1 credit card for each bike, therefore I used 3 credit cards, then not knowing which is for what bike. The touch screen you have to input all the information is not touch sensitive, so you end up reentering and pushing harder for all the information it is asking you, several screens to go through, while a line is forming behind you. At the end of trying to rent 3 bikes it took us almost the 30 minutes to get the bikes only to have to re dock the bikes at the same station, yet we would have to wait in the line of disgruntled customers after we took so long. 30 minutes for anyone whether a commuter and especially for a tourist which it seems to attract is way too short. Plus we ended up getting charged over $30 on each credit card for keeping the bikes for 2 hours, since we wanted to avoid the nightmare of having to re dock them every 30 minutes due to the confusion of 3 credit cards and a line of people at the stations. Also there are not always even bikes or dock slots open. So, if you are a tourist for the day in Chicago, we recommend avoid the DIVVY bikes due to the fact of long time to go through the screens and it doesn't take all credit cards and the time limit of 30 minutes, you really only have 20 minutes once you get going to find the next nightmare dock. They are not helpful in refunding either. This is not the only poor experience we have had so be warned to stay away from DIVVY until they improve their customer service in many aspects."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/20/2016,"Handy way to get around We found Divvy a convenient way to get around the Chicago lakefront. The bicycles are standard bikeshare 3-speeds: heavy and slow but functional. We rode them from the Field Museum to the Art Institute, then up the lakefront to the beginning of the Magnificent Mile. Chicago drivers seemed pretty tolerant of bikes but it is a busy city so it helps to be comfortable biking in traffic. You are not supposed to bike on the sidewalk. The lakefront path is a very pleasant ride.The key to bikeshare is to use them for point-to-point travel of less than 30 minutes, not a leisurely bike ride, as the charges increase after 30 min. It's also a very good idea to download the app as it'll tell you where the docking stations are located - and importantly whether there are any available bikes or open spots to dock. The dock closest to the Art Institute was full in the early afternoon on Friday so we had to find the next closest, a couple of blocks away."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,03/23/2016,"Loved this!! At first I was a bit intimidated on how to use this but was actually very easy. Unfortunately, your not allowed to ride on the sidewalks and we actually got yelled at in Millenium park for riding the bikes. Once we discovered the bike trails along the lakewalk we were hooked. We were easily able to get around and dock our bikes close to every location we wanted to visit including the Navy Pier and all the museums. My teenage son loved it! "
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,03/19/2016,"This was a bad idea My wife and I and another couple were visiting Chicago and decided to take a nice bike ride down the coast. We parked by a station with some open bikes, and were excited to check them out. To our dismay, we learned that you are charged extra for every half hour you have the bikes checked out. So we came up with a plan to stop and switch out bikes every half hour or so since you are not charged extra. This worked at first, but was a huge pain and instead of being able to take a nice ride, we were biking as fast as we could to get to the next station. We stopped after about an hour to go check out the beach and left our bikes at the station. After spending a few minutes there, we decided to head back, this time deciding that we wouldn't stop along the way so that we could enjoy the ride. But this time, the machine wouldn't read either of our credit cards. We called customer service and they just told us to walk to the next station. We were pretty annoyed about this since we only paid for two hours of parking and needed to get back. But we walked to the next station anyway. Once we got there, it read my credit card, but said we still had a bike checked out! We called customer service again, and they told us we had to go BACK to the last station to check on the bike, even though we had all checked our bikes and made sure they were secure. So one of us headed to the car, while the rest of us had to go back to the station. Long story short, our 2 hour leisurely bike ride turned into a one hour bike race down the coast followed by another hour and a half of walking back and forth. The machines didn't work, the customer service basically couldn't do anything about it, and they offered no refunds or compensation. If you're on a timetable or a budget, these are a bad idea."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,03/07/2016,"Excellent Way To Get Around I'm a chicago bike commuter. I have  been happy using Divvy bike system for 2 years! Annual membership very affordable. Excellent way to get around and see the city! Upgraded this past year with increased 
bikes/docks for areas north and south of downtown."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/28/2015,Fun but Beware of the Fee Options We rented the Divvy Bikes when we visited Chicago. We bought the 24 hr pass and thought that allowed us unlimited use. Only to find that only the first 30 minutes of each segment is free and after that there are per hour charges. So our 2 hour ride ended up costing us $45 (which I didn't know until the credit card bill came). I should have taken more time to read all the fee options at the Kiosk. We rode along the lake and it was really beautiful - nice trail for bikes.
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/14/2015,"Good System, But Be Prepared & Do Your Homework! This was my wife's & my first time using a public-share bike system and we really enjoyed it. Primarily we used it along the lake shore and not downtown itself (we didn't feel safe riding on the streets with so much traffic). In general the bikes were comfortable, easy to use and in good working condition. With that being said you really need to be prepared and do your homework. Once you pay your $10 +/- you can use the bikes all day but only in 30 minute intervals. True, this can be a challenge (that's how they make their $) so you have to know where you're going and if there is a station(s) along the way. I strongly recommend checking out their website and reviewing their policies, maps & videos before using this system. I also downloaded their mobile app which had an interact map showing all of their bike station locations. I've read some complaints saying that the app showed a station only to find, upon arriving to that location, there was no station there. We never had that problem. However like other reviewers have commented, we have rode our bikes to stations only to find that there were no bikes available to use (for example - aquarium, planetarium, museums, pier, etc. / typically in the afternoon & evening when everyone is looking for a way ""home"" from the touristy spots). It was no problem for us since we didn't put ourselves in that situation of relying on a bike to get home from the popular destinations. Since we already had bikes we simply checked our bike back in at the next station, got a new 30-minute use code and rode our bikes to the next station along our route. Once you get the system down it's a lot of fun and a great way to see the Chicago sites!"
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/11/2015,Doesn't work Walked 15 minutes to Divvy bike rack and there were no bikes available. Walked 15 minutes to the next Divvy bike rack and after entering information on the touch screen it reset and went back to the beginning. Did this twice and hailed a cab.
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/09/2015,A great way to move about in Chicagos I rented Divvy bikes instead of taking a hop-on-hop-off bus tour. I'm glad I did. I could visit all the same places a bus would have visited and could choose my own routes. I especially enjoyed riding up the lakefront. There are lots of docking stations all around. Docking a bike every 30 minutes can be a bit annoying but even without pre-planning I managed to find a new docking station within 30 minutes. I browsed through different areas of the city with my iPad and the iPhone app when connected to a wifi network and the app showed the docking stations even when offline. The Android app didn't.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/05/2015,Easy and Awesome! This is such a fantastic city feature! My husband and I really enjoyed biking throughout the city. Used them all day and night. A huge savings and a great way to see the city; you miss so much riding in a car. The only minor hiccup came when biking to Soldier Field to check it out and tailgate. We weren't familiar with the area and spent 30-40 minutes trying to get an open dock. Little did we know that right in front of the field (Field Museum) they had employees taking all extra bikes to free up docks for return. I wish that notice came up when selecting that a nearby dock was full and you were re-routed.
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/29/2015,"Easy Bikes The Divvy Bikes were a great addition to our weekend plans in Chicago. They were easy to rent, easy to return and easy to ride.  I will look for these bikes on future trips to Chicago."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,09/24/2015,"Excellent Concept, Below Average Implementation The title of the review sums this service up pretty well. Exciting opportunity to have access to bikes in locations throughout Chicago. Reasonable cost to rent, apps make finding stations easy and finding safe bike lanes simple. The apps do tell you where bikes are and how many are at the station, but at rush times the bikes can be cleared out (if you are looking for one) or stations filled (if you'd like to return one) for the location you want and all the surrounding ones. During special events they have staff at locations like the lakefront or train stations, but those are rare. I just am not sure if a city of Chicago run entity or any entity for that matter can fully implement this concept effectively. The amount of staff it might require to truly pay attention to all the stations might be cost prohibitive. In the end, I use it as it is ""fun"" and beats walking, just be prepared to be frustrated 30-40% of the time if you can find a bike or get rid of one when and where you want to."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/23/2015,Never got to ride!! We tried 3 times at one station and after going through all the prompts (the last one with customer service on the line) we could not get it to work. He told us to walk to the next station and try there. Same thing. Customer service not helpful. The system definitely needs work!! With all the time wasted we could have walked to our destination faster without the hassle.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/11/2015,"A great way to see the area A great and economical way to see the area. There are numerous places to pick up and return these bikes so you don't incur extra costs by going over 30 minutes. You just return the bike to one of the many sites, get a new pin from the machine and take 2 more. If you download the free app it has a timer, a map of the docking sites and how many bikes available. Would use it again!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/09/2015,Great rides along the lake front Used the bikes 3 times while we were in Chicago. It was labor day weekend so many people were visiting downtown. To get a bike takes quite a few screens to get through so long lines were forming every station we went to. They did have Divvy people there to help but still long lines.
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,09/09/2015,"Good if you can find a bike. We decided to use the Divvy bikes instead of renting one as A.) It's so much cheaper and B.) We didn't want the bike for that long.The 24 hour pass is $9.95 but you must check your bike in at a check point every 30 minutes to avoid an additional charge (however the charge isn't too bad and still works out cheaper than renting a bike if you happen to go over the time limit.) The first day we used a Divvy bike our closest point was empty, so we walked about 4 blocks to the next point where there were very few bikes left. We jumped on and rode along the lake to Lincoln Park which was lovely. Due to the very hot, humid weather we couldn't bare riding back so hopped on a bus and decided we'd do an evening bike ride later on.In the evening we walked to 3 Divvy bike stops and all were empty, making the $9.95 seem a bit pointless for a 30 minute ride out of 24 hours. Thankfully at the weekend they were offering free 24 hours passes, we located a Divvy Stand but the 2 bikes remaining were broken, so walked to another 3 stops and on the 4th stop finally got a bike! Overall, if you can get a bike and only want it to get to A - B then this is a great way of getting about. It's so much cheaper than renting a bike, however the having to check it in every 30 minutes really takes the fun out as you have to keep clock watching. We did really enjoy riding the bikes and there are plenty of Divvy stands around to check the bike in, but well located stands tend to have no bikes resulting in a long walk to actually get one. I'd definitely use it for a lake front ride but anything more can be a bit of a drag and make sure you do your research to locate a Divvy stand to check your bike into after the 30 minutes!!!I think 30 minutes is too little, even if it got upped to a 45 minute ride it would help a lot more!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/07/2015,"Lots of fun! We took advantage of the free Saturday promotion and thoroughly enjoyed riding bikes along the lakefront. As long as you do your research and understand the process, it's a great service. The system was slow but I expect that was due to increased demand. The only station we had trouble at was Navy Pier were all docks were full and our time was running out. No worries, we added time and found two other stations nearby which led us to discovering a restaurant we would otherwise have missed and thoroughly enjoyed. I wouldn't have paid the full price times a family of four given that we'd already paid for CTA passes but with the free promo, I'm glad we took advantage of it!"
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/03/2015,"NOT FOR TOURISTS, They will rip you off The $9.95 for a 24 hour bike ride cost $132!!!!! Called to dispute the charges and was informed that they are NOT FOR TOURISTS They are for a 30 minute bike ride to get you from point A to point B. (Even though the website says differently) Do not use to enjoy the city.What they do is charge you in 30 minute incriments, anything over your initial 30 minutes, youre charged $8 for each 30 minute period. It will take you that long to find the next parking hub. Complete rip off! The bikes cost as much as my car rental! I called to ask if there was hidden charges and they said no, they're liars and scammers looking to benefit off of tourists! DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT USE!!"
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,09/01/2015,"More than meets the eye! I think the bikes are great, but all the other crap you have to do to use them really drags down the experience. We rented the bikes at Navy Pier for my family of 4. After a modest 5 minute wait in line, it was our turn at the kiosk. Surprise #1. You can only rent 2 bikes per credit card! Thank god my wife brought her purse and we had a second one on us. After all that confusion, we then got our 2nd surprise of the day. Surprise#2. You have to ""check in"" at a bike station every 30 minutes or there is a penalty-which essentially means you can't go anywhere you want, but must map out your journey so you strategically go by a Divvy bike station every 30 minutes. The bikes were solid, well maintained. Would of rated this experience higher if it wasn't for all this other stuff. I wish I could of. "
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/30/2015,"Probably Not Worth It if you don't have a smart phone with GPS, AVOID! You won't be able to find the stations (which are often tucked away from the main interesections where they are posted to be on the map). which often malfunction or are full where you want to go. "
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/23/2015,"Deceptive marketing Seven of us visited Chicago. We stayed downtown and planned to bike to the Lincoln Zoo along the lake. Divvy bikes was recommended by the hotel. It took us a few phone calls and several tries to unlock the bikes. After 20 minutes we finally left the station. Being from out of the country we had never used this system and selected the $9.95 day pass - someone in our group said it may be an additional $2 for the second hour. To my dismay, I was charged $107.78 (Cdn) on my VISA for 2 bikes for just over 2 hours. My sister had the same charge and my other sister was only charged $9.95. Customer service was not friendly and said the charges are clearly listed on the website - which I only saw a week after the fact, however it is very complicated to figure out. In addition, the site mentioned that you had to take the bike to a docking station every 30 minutes - but it took us very long to check the bikes out in the first place and we did not notice any stations while riding north along the lake. There should be a limit on the amount charged and a warning to tourists not to rent Divvy bikes. The only cost that was CLEARLY advertised was the $9.95/day pass. I assume the city must make a lot of money from people unfamiliar with this service."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/18/2015,"Wheels on tour! In Chicago with the teenagers for the week and found the divvy bikes a great way to get around. Divvy bikes are the blue bikes for rent all around the city. For $9.95 per 24 hours, you can zip all around. One limitation is the 30 minute limit per bike trip or you get dinged with extra charges. You need to trade in the bike at the next divvy stand before the 30 minutes is up and check out another bike (all on the original fee). Lots of stations in key sightseeing spots so not to worry. We stayed at a large hotel on Michigan Ave and found that the 30 minutes was fine for a ride to the Museum or Millennium Park or around the beaches. No problem and the kids liked the freedom to explore. And you know that teenagers are hard to please!"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/13/2015,"Great for locals and visitors too! During my recent visit to Chicago my daughters and I rented the Divvy bikes. We enjoyed biking the city, around the lake and to the parks. One of my daughters lives in Chicago. Her and her fiance love to rent the Divvy's for a weekend bike ride. It's great for visitors to the area as well, easy to navigate through the city and drop at one of the stations while site seeing. I highly recommend trying Divvy bikes and wish I had come up with the idea!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/13/2015,So easy and fun! This is a terrific way to get around town.  There are so many options available.  We had a blast.  Combine the bikes with CTA and you can really see a lot of chicago in a short amount of time!
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/10/2015,"Easy to use bike rental This is the first time that I have used a city bike share service.  It is very easy to use & Chicago is the best city to try this out.  The endless bike paths make you feel safe, especially for an occasional bike rider."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/08/2015,"Rented for 24 hours at $9.95 . Lots of fun we rented at a location near the Lincoln Pk zoo. I downloaded the app so as I travelled, I knew where the nearest bike drop was. You are limited to a 30 minute segment on the bike before you have to dock it. You can take time out away from the bike and then reapply for a new code to take out a different bike. Lots of fun."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/08/2015,"Affordable Bikesharing in Chicago Divvy is Chicago's bike sharing system, if you are familiar with other cities systems, this should be easy for you. Check their website and other reviews here for more info. Basic common sense and some planning can help. Bring a helmet, find a bike that fits your height before unlocking it, then you don't have to adjust it, however it's fairly easy to raise or lower most seats. Test that first before unlocking. There are no drink holders, but a thick bungee cord for holding a bag in front. Make sure the your valuables are very secure, as I had a bag slip thru while biking. Always make sure you have a destination station in mind, and a plan B if it's full. You can check online to see what's open, but it can be unpredictable. I always make sure to have several spots open at destination station before I depart. We've encountered a problem returning a bike once, due to faulty mechanism. Things happen, so if you have a plan B, you don't have to worry about it. In general the bikes are comfortable and sturdy if a bit heavy. They have gears and are easy to ride. Obey safe biking laws, and try to use the bike lanes. Make sure to time your trip, to accommodate 30 min. limit. There are plenty of stations so you can bike and stop to explore the city with ease and convenience. Join Divvy for small yearly fee or take advantage of a day pass. I surprised my husband with a mystery biking adventure all planned with various divvy locations. I now use Divvy exclusively for around town biking, the convenience saves me from lugging my heavy bike down 2 flights of stairs."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/05/2015,"Good if your up for a scavenger hunt I called customer support after finding out I was supposed to dock every 30 minutes. I wanted to see what they charged and if it could be waived. I purchased the 24 hour pass and had the bike for 4 hours and the overage fees somehow were $62. This does not seem fair or reasonable. Customer service would not do anything, so I asked to speak to speak to a supervisor. She thought the fee was within reason, but agreed to reduce it to half. She said that the only way to get it fully waived is to email support. The overage fee and charges are very misleading. Had I known it was this much I would have rented a bike for $23."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/05/2015,"What an Adventure!  We rented this for the last couple days that we were in Chicago. I wish that we had tried it sooner. The premise is fairly self-explanatory. There are numerous spots around the city to rent these bicycles. Most are no more than a 15 minute ride apart from each other. Many are much less. For less than $10 for a 24 hour period, you can use these an unlimited amount of times. The only caveat is that you must check in at a station every 30 minutes and request a new code if you want to ride longer. We use this time limit to plan our day. We used the wonderful app on our phones to find where we wanted to go and where the closest station was at. The only time that we ever ran into an issue, was when the stations were completely full. In this case, you request a 15 minute extension for no charge and ride to the next station. We were able to get through town with ease, and saved numerous taxi trips. The bikes are well-maintained, and comfortable. This was a great way to ride along the lake and enjoy the weather."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/02/2015,"Complete waste of time and money. My wife and I spent 24hrs in Chicago and we thought that this would be a great way to see the city, We signed up for 2 24hr passes. While there is no shortage of stations and bikes, in practice most of the stations were not functioning. Sometimes we manged to take a single bike and the second code for releasing the bike would not work. I ended up running behind my wife while she rode. We met many other frustrated bikers with the same problems.My suggestion is to use the excellent public transportation or to find a bike rental company run by humans!"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/29/2015,"Great attraction This is a great way to see the downtown area of Chicago. You spend 9.95 for a 24 hour period. you can keep the bike for a 30 min ride, find a station to park it, then go on another 30 min ride. There are stations all over the downtown area. we rode from our hotel in river north to navy pier then back. Bikes were in great shape, and easy to ride."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/28/2015,"Terrible Experience Their policies are deceiving.  They are completely unhelpful on the phone and most of their stations were not functioning.  I would not recommend them at all.  Stay away, just rent a regular bike with real people."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/27/2015,"Good idea We had a great time getting around with the bikes but sadly had a very bad experience which got us of using Divvy Bikes. We went to go to Navy Pier and the station was full but a representative from Divvy was there to check the bikes in anyway. We trusted her putting in the information and taking the bikes. A few days later we check the bank account and they charged us for full day use, even though we only took the bikes from the station were we stayed to Navy Pier, which is about 15mins. We called to get our money back because the bill was over $100. They said it is our problem because we can't proof that we actually dropped of the bikes at that time. In the end we got some of it refunded but not all. We guess the lady forgot to press a button or whatever. We recommend to always put them in the station and make sure it locked. Otherwise it is a great way to get around town and a great idea."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/27/2015,Go Divvy! My daughter and I rented Divvy bikes during our recent stay in Chicago for a convention. I was a little nervous at first about the 30 minute docking but there really were enough docks to check in / out every 30 minutes. We ended up renting the bikes 3 times and docked a couple times each time in a 24 hour period so the price was great for the amount of use we got out of it.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/26/2015,"There are Tricks You must be 16 to rent a bike and you can only rent 2 bikes per credit card, so you need to plan ahead if you come with a family. We brought just our 8 year old's bike, planing to rent for the rest of us so we didn't have so many bikes on the car for our cross country trip. We also brought our own helmets. The other thing to know is that it is $9.95 for a 24 hour pass, but if any trip is longer than 30 min, you get charged more so you need to plan to take several short trips. We loved going on the lakefront path, but it was tricky to find. There is a cyclefinder app to help find the bikes and also a timer to help avoid the exra charges, and Google maps has a way to turn on bike paths, to help plot the best routes. We went from the south side to the Art Institute, Navy Pier, Lincoln Park, and Chinatown all on bikes. Great way to cover a lot of ground without parking and also getting some exercise!"
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/19/2015,Great concept - poor execution The concept is great and easy. The execution is flawed.Our experience was on a Friday. The third station we initially visited finally had bikes (we even had the app - which was nice but not up to date). After riding for 30 minutes found station was full. I hit the button indicating 'full station' but that didn't work. Found another station and got the overtime fee but able to exchange bikes.Got to next station and again full station and unable to exchange bikes - many people trying to get bikes but card reader not working.Basically if you get to a full station - you are in trouble because the card reader is not working to allow people to take/exchange bikes. All you can do is return them until station is full.I would have paid more to have 1 or 2 hour intervals instead of 30 minute intervals.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/17/2015,"Best way to see the city Seriously, $7 for 24 hours! Yes, you only have 30 minute intervals to use the bike (you have to dock and then request a new code), but there are hundreds of locations throughout the city. Must download the app too. It tells you every location and how many bike are available at each place.We always got where we were going in less than 20 minutes anyway and never ran into any issues of not having enough bikes or not have a rack available to park and it was a very busy weekend in the city with lots of festivals and conferences going on. The only downside is if you wanted to go on a long bike ride say along Lake Shore Drive that may not be possible. Can't say because I didn't really look into."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/15/2015,Station Frustration Great concept that we were excited to find since my wife was pregnant and not wanting to walk excessively. This allowed us to take in a whole lot more of the Lake front/downtown area with a nice leisurely bike ride. However there was a trail of frustrations that hopefully can be ironed out for future riders.1) The station we had planned to use first had no bikes...Adler Planetarium - probably because not a big dropoff spot but a frustration none-the-less. We walked to Shedd.2) I checked in at the Shedd station before going in so that the process would be quicker after and rented 2 bikes. After our visit at the museum The Shedd station credit card reader wasn't working. Several people were around trying to get bikes and some were phoning but the only suggestion was to go to the Field Museum station (approx 10 minute walk). We had already paid for the day rental so we went there to see.3) The Field museum station was fully stocked with bikes however the people around the station indicated that this station wasn't reading credit cards either. Someone phoned and it was suggested that we walk to Michigan avenue another 10-15 minute walk. Would have been nice if the operator wouldn't send us to a faulty station. They must have known because someone told us it was down all day.4) Michigan station - we finally got a bike and got to ride down Michigan. Stations were well spaced here and we had no problems docking and checking in. 5) We walked through Taste of Chicago to another station but they only had 1 bike. My wide rode the bike and I jogged to Navy Pier. We got another bike.6) We rode along the lake to 360 Chicago and then headed back to Adler. When we checked in at another station it took our bikes but wouldn't read our cards. We walked 10 minutes to another station and it had no bikes. We walked to another station on Michigan and finally found bikes. The bikes took us a long ways but failed at getting us back. So much for my wife not walking much. If you use this system be prepared for unreliable stations and unpredictable availability.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/13/2015,"BEAUTIFUL WAY TO EXPERIENCE LAKEFRONT  Visitors only need a credit card. Read instructions online or if you are lucky as we were and found a locale with an attendant on a Sunday afternoon who walked us thru it. Press screen to activate, press language, press buy a new card, in our case allowed us to purchase two cards $14 for 24 hours use. Machine gives you codes on screen but also prints ticket with time out. Important. Go to any bike, type in code, green light flashes and bike is released. Hint, lift back seat, easier to remove. Ride away. BE MINDFUL OF TIME. Within 30 minutes simply stop by another station, repeat process but do not pay again, select ISSUE NEW CODE. Take back your same bike if you like.We chose continuous riding but easy to use for transport. Visit something and hop another bike. Hotels can print out station maps. Good exercise and great vistas."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/13/2015,"Nice ride however frustrating process My girlfriend and I went to Chicago last month and wanted to rent these bikes. Having to swipe our credit cards over 50 times, it finally worked. Nice bike ride on the harbour front however made it really fun!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/12/2015,"Bikes in Chicago Divvy bikes were fun to use in Chicago along the lakefront trails. Once you figure out how to use, it's better, but a little confusing. It's challenging that you need to check in every 30 minutes or get extra charges. The overall 24 hour fee is very reasonable, but it would be easy to rack up more charges. If you could rent the bikes at a little higher fee and get say 2 hours, that would be more convenient."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/06/2015,Nothing but frustration here !  I wish I had something good to say about the bike rentals in Chicago but unfortunately I have nothing redeeming to say about the service . You only can rent the bikes for 30 minutes so you spend most of your time finding the next place to park your bike. Then after that I need to re-sign in to get a new bike . We struggled and we watched many many grown functional intelligent adults not to able to sign up for a new bike try or get a bike that's already been used. It is such a poor system from start to finish and the bikes don't work that well . When you do final fine one that works well it's great ride around the city but man it's such a painful.concept. They said we should charge more allowed to renters have the bike longer than 30 minutes they could make more money and to be a less stress on the rentals.
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/03/2015,"Nice option, hard to figure out  It took us 20 min to buy our bikes. Our form was rejected twice. On the third time we didn't get codes and had to call. When we finally got codes, I got a deep bruise pulling the bike out. However, the app is nice and the many locations convenient. We enjoyed biking the lakefront trail"
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,06/30/2015,"Fun and easy way to get around town! I was in Chicago on business. After our meetings my coworker and I rented some Divvy bikes to explore the Lakeside Trail and downtown. Only drawback is you have to return them within 30minutes to avoid overage fee. Also, the second time we got bikes the machine wouldn't read my credit card, so I ended up having to purchase 2 passes. I was able to call the company and they promptly refunded me. Even with the hassle of the credit card, it was still a fun way to get around town. We even rode bikes back to the hotel from dinner instead of taking a cab!"
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/29/2015,"Make sure you bring multiple cards if you're a family!! Would have loved to use the Divvy Bikes but couldn't. 1) We are from the US but have Chase's upgraded ""chip and pin"" credit cards. Divvy wouldn't accept them. 2) We had a Meijer Mastercard on us but Divvy only allows 2 bikes to be reserved under 1 card. (It also didn't accept our Discover) 3) We called Divvy to see if we could charge our third rider over the phone but we couldn't. Therefore we walked and took taxis instead :("
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/25/2015,The bike ride along the waterfront is very enjoyable. The bikes are used for 30 minutes at a time without additional charges. You have to get to your next stop in that timeline. Does stop you from maybe enjoying the riverfront as the south end does not have many stops so you are pressed fro time to get the bike to the next stop without incurring fees.
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/23/2015,"Outstanding way to get around Divvy is a great way to get around, especially during the two weeks we have good weather here in Chicago. In case you can't take five minutes to read the details of your rental, here you go:1. It's $7 for 24 hours, in 30 minute increments, meaning you have to re-dock your bike every half hour or incur charges. People think this is a rip-off, but this is a bike SHARING system. If you could take the one bike for 24 hours, no bikes would be available. 2. Each station has a map showing where the other stations are. Most stations downtown are within a 2 minute bike ride, maybe a bit more in the neighborhoods. In any case, you shouldn't have a problem finding a station within 30 minutes, unless you're trying really hard not to find one. There's a Divvy app you can download that shows you where the stations are, and how empty/full they are. 3. Check your bike for flats first, and adjust the seat!4. Finally, you can save a ton by not paying for parking at the most popular attractions in the city."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/22/2015,"Useless Don't accept non-US credit card which you only find out after failing at two stations, causing huge upset to travel plans and then googling for the answer. This ludicrous failing is not even advertised or the information given as to why credit card rejected. Sort it out Chicago."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/16/2015,"What a great idea! These bike stands are all over the city. You get unlimited rentals for 24 for only $7. A good way to see the city, as many roads are bike friendly and the entirety of the lakeshore is a bike/walking path."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/15/2015,Not working for european tourists At the last weekend i tried to rent a bike at the Divvy station. But the kiosk doesn't accept my credit carts (VISA and Mastercard).I walked to a other station and tried it again. Same problem.Then i called the hotline. The adviser told me to by an american prepaid credit card because european credit cards are not accepted. No sooner said than done. I looked for a shop to buy such card. After 24 hours (activation time of the card). Next try. But again not possible to rent a bike.Therefore i can't recommend this service.It's better to walk or buy your own bike.
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,06/09/2015,"Great idea but needs work So start with the positives - this is a great idea and a great way for tourists to tour/get around the waterfront area in Chicago (which is beautiful btw). However, that said, it does not work well on a busy beautiful Saturday/Sunday afternoon when everybody wants to ride a bike! So here is our experience -We easily picked up 4 bikes at a downtown location near South Michigan Avenue. The 30 minute check in time flew by and we went to check in our bikes at a location on the waterfront. It appears that location's machine was not working well - there was a guy there trying to fix it - the racks were full of bikes and there were dozens of people standing around wanting a bike but it appeared nobody could get one! Our precious 30 minute time slot was quickly running out and finally at the last minute a few spaces opened up and we were able to quickly put our bikes on the rack so we didn't get charged the extra money. But then the lineup for the machine to re-check out another bike was a mile long! So we decided we would walk to the next location (how far could it be right?) When we got there, there was 1 lonely bike in the rack but no line up at the machine! So now there were people coming back with their rentals, racking them up and then checking them back out immediately (which is what we would have done at the last location except we couldn't get near the machine!) So again we walked to the next location - right at Navy Pier - it was a zoo with lots of bikes and lots of people - so this time we stood in line and waited to get our ticket to recheck out our bikes. We finally got our new codes and went to check out our bikes - 3 out of the 4 codes worked so 3 of us had our bikes - the 4th code would not work so 3 of us are standing there wasting minutes of our precious 30 minute time period waiting for the 4th person to get the attention of an attendant who happened to be there and get his bike out! We used up that 30 minutes, racked the bikes up for the last time and swore we would not do that again!So how could this be better? First of all - they need a much better system for rechecking out the bikes every 30 minutes. You should not have to rack your bike and then get in line to get a new ticket. And 30 minutes is really no time at all on a bike - could the rechecking period not be made at least 60 minutes? So - try it if you want - but beware those nice sunny days especially on the weekend!"
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/07/2015,"Great idea...needs work My husband and I are not rubes so we knew how to handle a bike in a large, busy city but this system needs some work. 1. Look your bike over if you can, some are in really rough shape and you'll regret it once you start pedaling. 2. A lot of the stations are either full or empty no in-between3. The system of getting tickets with new codes for getting bikes is inefficient and fills your pocket with garbage4. Do locals even use these? I am not convinced. You guys need to put more stations along the Lakefront Trail. This is where everyone wants to bike. Do you want confused tourists getting honked at in Chicago traffic...NOPE. 5. The on street bike infrastructure does not match the number of stations. You need more lanes and cycle tracks because Chicago drivers are insane and scary and the tourists get scared and ride on the sidewalks like idiots. "
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/06/2015,"Great fun, but excess charges makes this expensive & confusing. Used Bike share for a ride in Chicago - great way to get around and see the sights. Rented for 2.5 hours but got hit with a $30 excess use fee. It seems the bike needs to be checked in every 30 minutes and checked out again for continuing use.The signage did not make it clear at all about these conditions of use.Total cost for 2 bikes on our ride was $44 making it much more expensive than expected."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/31/2015,"Great outings We loved using Divvy bikes. The lakefront area and Lincoln Park lend themselves to biking very well. At $7 for a day, they are a bargain even though you need to turn them in every 30 minutes. Most of the places that we wanted to visit were within 30 minutes of each other. These are bulky, three-speed cruiser bikes, not meant for exercise riding..For exercise or distance riding there are regular bike rentals available along the water front.Suggest downloading the Divvy bike app before you go as it will help you find the next bike station. There are penalties for not returning the bike every 30 minutes so you need to keep track of time and location of bike stations. If you want to use a bike all day, it is more convenient to rent a regular bike. A regular bike will also get you a helmet, something that does not come with Divvys."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/30/2015,"Excellent idea Thank you so much for making my trip to Chicago so much easier, fun and healthy. It is a great concept that you guys have come up with, I made great use of it.Chicago trip would not have been so enjoyable and convenient without your bicycles."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/22/2015,"SO MUCH FUN! What a fabulous way to travel and sightsee. Such a simple system to use, and great way to get about. I was never intimated riding in the city, great exercise, stop and go when we wanted, and always a convenient place to dump the bike and pick up a new one. Way to go Chicago for adding this to your city!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/11/2015,"Good way to know Chicago  The Divvy bike system allows you to move around Chicago cheaply and with a good chance to see more of the city than you would using taxis, buses or other means of transportation. The system works although sometimes you have to wait and try several times to get the bikes, but in general the rides are in ok shape and work properly. Good system. "
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/09/2015,"Great Sunday Morning Ride We headed out on the affordable and convenient Divvy bike system on a sunny, Sunday morning. We rode down the lake shore to Navy Pier and the on to Millienium Park. It's a great way to get around the city-just be sure to turn them in every 30 minutes. The lake path around Navy Pier was under construction."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/06/2015,Great way to see the city As a dutch guy used to cycling this is a perfect way to see the city from a different view. Did the lakefront trail from McCormick conference center to the hotel. Using the bike was easy and convenient. If you use the streets in the downtown area you should be used to the traffic otherwise it can be a bit scary.
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/28/2015,"Great way to see the city, spend the day This is a fantastic way to get around. There are plenty of stations throughout the city, so you can easily get your bike checked back in within 30 minutes. Many of the streets have bike lanes, so it was just fine riding around. In some of the more popular areas (for example, around Lakeshore Dr.), sometimes the stations can be filled up or have nonworking stalls, which can be a bit of a pain. However, most are fine and the bikes are in fairly good condition. This allows you to cover WAY more ground than walking, and you can get to all the attractions without the hassle of parking or dealing with cab fare/public transit. Highly recommend this!"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/05/2015,"Great way to see the city!  We rented the hikes for a 24 hour period and literally saw the entire Lakeshore + activities! It was a much cheaper alternative to any other form of transportation in the city. It was beautiful to bike along the lakeshore and see the skyline. One minor issue when there wasn't enough to bikes to take out, but just went to the next docking station and grabbed one there. Easy to plan timing and return/take out. Wish we had something like this in our city! "
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/30/2014,"Great service for visitors I love bike share programs, and Chicago's is excellent. There are plenty of stations around all the spots visitors are likely to travel to, and the system is easy to use. Combined with the smartphone app, it is easy to plan out a route and check stations to make sure they have bikes or spots to return them. While you only have 30 minutes per trip before there are extra charges, it was very easy for us to plan our routes so that we would stop at a station, return the bikes, then check them back out to get a fresh 30 minutes. Combined with the bike trails along the lake, it was easy to get around and see everything we wanted."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/20/2014,"Well restocked so that they are almost, always in the rack My bedroom overlooks a Divvy Bike stand in the South Loop. So brushing my teeth, I see the employees in fair or foul weather restocking the rack of bikes. Before Bears games, or after. For over a year, these hard working people always rebalance the bikes so they are available. Since I haven't used one, cannot speak to that. But they do try (they come usually three times a day that I see) to keep the bikes available in the stand...but also, space for ones to be dropped off."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/22/2014,What a great vibe The Divvy Bikes made it so easy to explore Chicago.  Some of the streets were so bike friendly with dedicated bike lanes.  The phone app to locate bike stops was so easy.  Thanks.
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/06/2014,"Divvy doesn't accept non-US credit cards The idea is fantastic, but obviously it's only for those who have a US credit card! We did manage to buy our 24 hr ticket, did manage to get our bikes, but once we docked (quite some kilometers from our hotel) the party was over. We called customer service, who advised us to try the next kiosk. Which didn't work. We called again, were advised to buy another pass. Which we tried: it was not about the money, we just wanted to bike! We tried 5 different credit cards at 5 different kiosks, called customer service serveral times. What do we do wrong??? We finally got the answer. 'You don't have a US credit card!' If we only would have known that these services are only for those who posess a US credit card. In order to do others a favor, we asked Divvy to add this information to their website, kiosks etc."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,10/01/2014,"Good option over bus or taxi, but not for touring Have rented bikes in Chicago before, but when saw the Divvy rack outside our hotel and the $7 for 24 hour price thought it would be the best option. Didn't realize that you can only ride for 30 minutes at a time, then must check in at a rack before taking another ride. So if you want to go on a long ride along the terrific Chicago lake shore than rent from a bike rental company. If you want to enjoy the city by bike as you go from Art Institute to Millenium Park to Navy Pier to restaurant, etc than Divvy is an option as is CTA. "
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/28/2014,"Pleasant and fun bike ride We tried these out one day on a visit to Chicago and used the bikes for a ride along the lake side bike trail that runs along the shore of Lake Michigan We rode from the Edgewater area, south to the Oak Street Beach downtown docking our bikes about 3 times to make the trip since we stopped to do a little site seeing along the way. You can rent the bikes for 7.00 a day, the down side being that you have to park them at a docking station every half hour or incur additional fees. The stations are all over the place and as long as you time your ride , you really can do it for just the 7.00 for the day. I would suggest printing off a map of the docking stations before you ride. The bikes are simple 3 speed bikes designed mostly for sightseeing and commuters and are built like tanks. Too big for kids and they do take a little while to get used too. The ride along the lake is beautiful however."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,09/23/2014,"Loved the Ride; Hated the glitches in the System We were excited to rent these bikes to ride along the Lake Michigan Waterfront. At $7 for 24 hour hours this is quite a bargain!. The downside is the technology and the requirement to return the bike to a kiosk and ""re-rent"" every half hour. We kept the bikes for two hours and loved our ride along the lake-- near Oak Street Beach and North. However, we had problems returning the bikes and getting a ""green light"" to show we had. In two hours, we had to call divvy bikes for help twice. A helpful hint is to download an app about biking chicago. This app will show you where nearby Divvy stations are located, how far away they are, how many bikes are available at a particular station and will also let you set an alarm to let you know how much time you have before you need to return the bikes to a kiosk. A great way to see the sights and get some exercise. Remember--helmets do not come with these bikes. "
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/21/2014,"Don't bother unless you have a US credit card. I really wanted to hire a bike and ride around the city and enjoy the beautiful Sunday weather. Unfortunately, none of my UK or Australian credit or debit cards were accepted. I expect this is because of the chip and PIN functionality that most cards (outside the US) now have. I tried it with a swipe-only pre-paid card I had from Aus, that was accepted by the 'dip' machine, but the transaction still failed, likely because I couldn't put in a US postcode.Would have been fun, shame it wasn't designed with travellers in mind!I called their help desk, they confirmed it wasn't a fault with the station, they said 'yes overseas cards work' but they didn't realise that most overseas cards now have chip and PIN. If you have an old swipe-only card maybe it would work.Very disappointing!Also strange how it said $7 on the sign, but when you start with the machine transaction it straight away becomes $14."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/20/2014,Convenient and fun A bit expensive at $7 an hr with a hefty fine for using it over half an hr but very convenient with spots all over the city. It was a bit hard to get the lock sorted but once we were off and rolling very convenient 
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/18/2014,"A beautiful hour along the lakeshore path I approached my Chicago biking experience with a plan - bike as far as I could along the lakefront without over doing it. I rented a bike a few blocks West of the lake and biked in the bike lane on Illinois avenue until the lane ended and I had to become one with the traffic - a tad daunting for a tourist, but I managed. It also took me awhile to locate the lake front bike path from Navy Pier, but once found, I had a great ride to Lincoln Park and back in just over an hour. I have no idea what the charge for this might have been, but it was worth it. A beautiful day and a beautiful fellow tourist to help me re-dock the bike at the end of the ride. I overshot the curb cut at one point by a few feet due to pedestrian traffic and my idea to lift the bike over a curb was met with a surprise - these bikes weigh a ton! Lifting it even six inches was a mighty feat. Also, some of the ""flipping"" around I do on my bike at home to change directions from a resting point is not going to happen with these heavy 3-speed jobs. Not sure I would trust the availability, reliability and/or speed of these bikes to deliver me from Spot A to Spot B, but a loose, casual goal for one was a beautiful way to spend an hour with the rest of humanity on a lakeside Saturday and I am grateful these bikes were available for that purpose. It would have taken me 3 hours to walk the same distance/see those same sights, so that is a deal almost any way you slice it."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,09/17/2014,"Nice if they all worked 7 dollars for 24 hrs with 30 min is deff a great deal. I would recommend using the app with GPS to plan your routes as well as identifying back up stations.Some things I ran into in my one day rental.Not all stations are functioningStation which simply wouldn't take my CC to to get a new code (the station was full of bikes so that should of been a hint)Calling the operator to ask if they can generate a new code with my CC was also not an option so I had to walk 4 blocks to find another station. Station had broken bike returns , the bikes simply wouldn't lock when trying to return , so I had to find another station to return then walk back 6 blocks. On the bright side I was able to explore the city and ride down lake shore all for 7 bucks.  "
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/16/2014,"Nice idea, but not for us as tourists What confusion! Thank goodness there's someone who works for the company at each kiosk we went to, because it was confusing to sign up the first time, it was really confusing to figure out where the next kiosk was located (we did the app, but the map didn't say, for instance, that you had to go under a bridge and over to get to the kiosk...it just showed a dot on a map. 30 minutes is WAY too short a time period to get to the next kiosk!! Plus, do out-of-towners a favor and put some markings on the pavement or put up signs leading to your kiosks! Other people on Divvy bikes were asking US where to find the next stop, and we were no help.Also, we are tall, and the bike was uncomfortable for my 6'4"" husband. You can raise the seat, but not the handlebars, so his neck hurt after about 40 minutes. As other reviews have mentioned, it would be easier to just rent a bike for how ever many hours you wanted and ride up and down the lakeshore. That part was awesome...can't wait to do it again. Just not on a Divvy bike."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/16/2014,"Divvy Bikes: An Affordable and a Convenient Way to See the City! For travelers and locals alike, Divvy bikes are a great alternative to urban transportation. The bikes are very good, reliable and user friendly for non-bikers. I have been using Divvy bikes as a quick way to get around the city for two months now and have felt very safe and comfortable riding through downtown Chicago. Because the bike stands are a place to park it is a very easy way to travel short distances using bike lanes or along Lake Shore Drive!"
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,09/15/2014,"Dangerous Fun on Chicago's Streets My husband and I are avid city bikers, we live in a college town and bike everywhere. We never biked in Chicago, but were excited for the challenge and decided to rent the Divvy Bikes on a recent excursion. We used them for multiple purposes on our trip everything from leisure to actual transportation between places. Overall I enjoyed the ability to be able to bike, and not rely solely on cabs, and trains for getting around. Pro: Relatively cheap, $7 for a 24 hour passPro: Biking is FunPro: Take advantage of the bike paths along the lake shorePro: Cool basket like space on front of bike for carrying itemsPro: Big tires, allows ability to go on and off of curbs with easeCon: Once you get too far West Divvy check in points are sparseCon: Having to check in every 30 minutesCon: Check in & check out doesn't always go smoothlyCon: Brakes are crapCon: Downtown, Mag Mile - You better be ready to ride in the streetCon: Cab drivers & bus drivers tailgate you, and don't careCon: Super heavy, too heavy to carry up stairs for instance"
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/02/2014,"Labor Day in Chicago What a great idea but some execution issues. Trouble with getting bikes out and with 6 people, once the last bike was out, the first person had to restart to keep the 30 minute window moving. Maybe a 1 hour window would be smarter. So many miles of trails and the views along Lake Michigan made the ride a great experience. If we were to do this again we would probably look to rent bikes for the day or a set time and not worry about the every 30 minute restart. Overall a good idea but needs to be better executed."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/23/2014,"Nice way to see the Lakeside attractions I really like the convenience of this. 30 minutes per use, I wish I could
have opted for 1 hour at a time. Overall I went everywhere I wanted to go with time to spare, once I downloaded the app it was even easier."
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/15/2014,good in theory Loved the idea and the cost but when we went to hire the bikes one stand was empty and then found that we could only hire two bikes with each card. However when we tried our amex card it did not work. Not sure if this is just because we are from the UK. Met others who had not understood the need to return the bikes to a stand in 30 mins and feel sure that they will end up with a big bill.
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/13/2014,"Fun Fun Fun This the second time we have rented the Divvy Bikes. Always fun to ride along Lake Michigan and around Michigan Ave. Price is right as long as you watch your time and checks bikes back in when due. Only complaint is that you can only check out two bikes at a time and you can only use a credit card once. That is difficult when you have more than 4 in your family. Plus the machine is sensitive at reading the cards and sometimes lines are long so that just holds things up. With all that being said it is still worth it. I would recommend biking on a Sunday morning when there are no crowds, sail boats are out on the lake and it is serene. "
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/13/2014,"Very good when it is working This is a cool idea for getting around the downtown area and other areas close by. We rode around a lot over 6 days for relatively cheap. The idea is that you can rent a bike for 24 hours for $14. You pay the one time fee with a credit card and it gives you a code to enter on the bike dock. This unlocks the bike and off you go. The pros - cheap, many locations all over, an app that is supposedly great for locating bike stations (we were having personal app issues). Cons - you have to ""return"" your bike every 30 mins in order to avoid overage charges (you can do this as many times as you want within your 24 hour rental period), you then ""re-rent"" your bike and get a new code to unlock the bike (you must insert your original credit card so that they know you are the right person). You have to find a docking station where you are before the end of your 30 minutes - there are a lot but not always right in front of you when you need them and having to look at the website on your phone is not necessarily convenient, not all the docking spots work - sometimes you get a new code to rent the bike and it won't unlock (you have to make sure beforehand that the light on the dock is yellow). Sometimes it won't even let you return the bike because the docking space is not working. Then you have to either find another location and/or call the number listed on the machine. Sometimes the credit card reader is not working so you have to find another location - this happened several times for us and it was very frustrating. We called the number listed and they apologized and said they were having issues and added more time on our account for the trouble. All in al, I liked this idea and if everything had been working we would have rated it an excellent. Since there were issues I gave it only a Very Good. "
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/12/2014,"Had to walk We have risen the bikes before on our last trip to Chicago and it worked well the one day we used them so we used them again but after docking to get a new code, it wouldn't accept our card or the people behind us in line. So we called to see if they could give us a code because we had paid for it and the lady said they weren't able to give us a free code but my husband explained we have already purchased it, it's not free? She said there's nothing I can do you will have to walk to a different rental....frustrated as we have paid and can't use it, walked to the next one and there weren't bikes, finally we found one. Obviously frustrated that we paid to ride and she couldn't give us a code and instead were told to walk until we found one which defeats the purpose."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/04/2014,"Awful My family and I wanted to rent bikes to rife around Millennium and Grant Parks. The first station we tried none of our credit or debit cards would take and it was the same for every body else to. The next station we tried it was the same and people couldn't return their bikes so most of them had to pay an extra $7.00 for another half-hour of riding they spent trying to contact the company. I don't suggest renting bikes from Divvy and would never do it again, very disappointing."
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/29/2014,"I Love to Hate It... The Chicago Divvy bike system is a fantastic idea--in theory. You buy a 24 hour pass for $7. You get a code from the kiosk, enter the code into the bike rack, then remove your bike--in theory. Then, you can ride for 30 minutes before returning it to a station, where you return it to the rack, dip your credit card into the kiosk for a new code, then remove your new bike from the rack--in theory. Unfortunately, the kiosks are bogged down, the bike racks don't always lock and recognize a return, the lines for the kiosks are long and more often than not, the racks are either all full or empty, so you have to go to another station. We spent an entire day using Divvy and called customer service 5 times to fix code issues or to issue new codes because the bike racks didn't recognize our return. I LOVE the idea, but won't use it again until they get some kinks worked out."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/29/2014,"Ok, BUT The bikes were good, loved riding them, but be aware....we had to go to 4 stations to finally rent one and the directions it hives you yo get to close by stations are not clear to someone unfamiliar to the area. The fact that to avoid extra cost you have to return the bike every 30 min. Isn't great for the visitor who isn't familiar with the area either. We were afraid to go too far away from the stalls for fear of not being able to find a place to exchange bikes. We lived riding along the lake, but next time I would rent from elsewhere."
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/23/2014,"Really frustrating machines!! I was in Chicago for a long weekend, the concept is extremely good. The system worked good for the first day but the second day it seemed as if we had been ""black listed"" for using them too much the day before hahaha... Using the same credit card and same stations to get bikes, and none worked to get us on the bikes. It is definitely the way to get around in the city but if it does not work, its really frustrating!! I would recommended with the clear understanding that the readers seem to be the issue, and because I am a cyclist. I love it when I see tons of people using bikes as a mode of transportation. If I am in Chicago or a city with similar kind of bikes I will choose them over cars but hopefully this companies listen to us (customers) and try to fix these issues."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/22/2014,"Divvy made it easy to get around town without a car My husband and I used the Divvy rental bikes to get around town on a couple of occasions. Someone told us that Divvy is fairly new to Chicago, so not all the stations seemed ready. For example, our Google Maps mobile app said there was a station in a particular location, but someone told us that this location was still under construction. Something nice is that there is a map of nearby locations at each station, including a circle showing how far a 5-minute walk would be.The bikes are really heavy (probably because of the technology needed for the rental), so it made it a little difficult to ride and make tight turns. Overall, we had a blast using the bikes. We rode up the Lakefront Path, which is a must-do when visiting Chicago. We used the bikes to go to Rib Fest and do some sight seeing. Divvy made an already walkable city (no hills!) even easier to navigate!"
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/21/2014,"Better Customer Satisfaction Desperately NEEDED Apparently we have been using the DIVVY Bikes (Blue Bikes) all around the downtown Chicago area to get around. There is a convenience and pleasure to having access to these bikes in a lot of locations. There is also a lot of room for improvement for the bike user. During the month of July, we have encountered these problems along with others encountering the same problems. First you get only 30 minutes from point A to point B, to find another DIVVY bike stand. This does not give you enough time to unload your bike, especially if you are new to the DIVVY and have to locate a drop off. 30 minutes about time you are on your bike and headed out you will lose at least 5 mins. If you are with a few people, they too have to check out and if there is a line of people, which we have encountered at various locations, your time is ticking aways. Then when you get to another location and there is a line you have to wait to checkout another bike. The screens you have to go through are numerous and confusing especially to tourists and foreigners, they don't have a zip code or a easy phone number, along with reading all the acceptances you have to accept from 1 screen to another and there have been a few occasions credit cards work at one location and don't at the next, along with have to pay more than $7 if you go over the 30 minute check in, which adds up quickly. We got to the point where we avoided checking in because to check out again and wait in the line of people who don't understand the lengthy checkout process, gets frustrating. Also, after a month of these encounters, we walked to 2 locations in 1 day to find no bikes in the racks to be checked out. Talk about being stranded in a city! Too expensive, not enough time to ride should be 1 hour from point A to B, stock the bikes and make the screen more customer friendly for everyone to use!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/20/2014,"Excellent way to see the city The way it works... Go to a station, and $7 gives you a ""day pass."" However note that in order to make sure that people return bikes, and there's always a supply, they limit you to 30 minutes in any one stint before they start adding extra usage fees. You can trade in and out as much you want for the day, as long as each trade is 30 minutes or less. Our observation is that there were always enough bikes, but because the check-out process at the station is a little long, you can end up spending too much time in line waiting for people to get checked out. I think I would just incur the usage fees in the future to avoid the lines (the usage fees start small and then escalate at over an hour). They have an app where you can see the tons of different Divvy stations.We were there on a busy, gorgeous Saturday and rented our first bike at Millenium Park and traveled to Navy Pier and then up the lake shore up to Briar Theater to see Blue Man Group for a total of around 5 miles with one trade in the middle. Note that if it's a weekend, and you think it will be gorgeous to go to the lake shore, so will everyone else. Factor a fun, but pretty slow ride into your calculations. Also make sure you're pretty comfortable riding a bike in general - there are lots of pedestrians and bikers to navigate, and presumably you won't be wearing a helmet. Overall, we had a blast and would definitely recommend this as a way to navigate the city."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/18/2014,"Deceptive advertising We rented 4 bikes in the along lake Shore Drive"" while we all read the directions it was not clear you could only ride 30 minutes. the pass said for all day, it was a 24 hour pass after all. Riding from Millenium to North beach then back to the planetarium with a lunch stop costs us $180. For the use of four bikes. Needless to say I could have bought a bike for what the rentals cost. What a rip off to our guests and travelers from out of town. I will never use these bikes again."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/15/2014,"Made my Trip! I was in Chicago for a total of 18 hours, when I had two hours to kill between meetings I rented a Divvy Bike and was very glad that I did. I was able to see a lot of Chicago in a very short time. Chicago is also a bike friendly city."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/14/2014,"Love! Saved SO much $$! Got in some exercise, had a blast. Downloaded the app to my phone for a general idea of where I was. Loved that I could park, shop/sightsee & then pick up another bike. Great idea!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/11/2014,"Great concept but broken machines I love and hate the divvy bikes. There were stations near almost everything that I wanted to go to and it was much more fun than walking or driving. I would never take this if I had a set time that I wanted to be somewhere, but it was ok for the weekend, which is what I was using it for. However, the stations almost never worked. Spanish seemed to work more often than us than English. The process of renting needs to be made faster, and they should put more than one machine at the more popular stops. Once they work out the issues, I will use the bikes all the time."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/11/2014,"Family Vacation with 2 Families Two families with 5 kids ranging from 10 years to 15 years of age. We had a blase riding bikes along Lakeshore Blvd for 2 days. Rode up to Lincoln Park zoo and further north and then down south to the Field Musuem and Shedds Aquarium.Would have like to have rode down to the Science and Engineering museum, but due to events in that area at that time, we were not able.I will list the Pros and Cons below;Pros - can be a low cost. Easy to ride, plenty of bikes and station to pick up and turn in bikes. Can adjust seat heights and riding along Lakeshore Blvd was very scenic and fun. After the 1st day I figures out to ride the bikes for about 30 to 60 minutes and then dock bikes. Checking out bikes was easy if card machine is working. We were able to rent the bikes for about 15 dollars a day if checking in as required. Cons - You can only ride for about 30 minutes or you will inccur overtime charges. Overtime charges are not that bad for 30-60 minutes or even up to 90 minutes, but anytime after that can be expensive. You have to dock you bikes and then you can check them out again. But if you were like us with 8 bikes, you might come up to a station that does not have 8 docking stations ( so then what do you do - you want to turn in your bike but no places to dock so you end up going to another docking station). Next you have to charge the bike on a credit card and only two bike per credit card max. If you were like me with 4 then I had to use two credit cards. At times the machine would not read one of my credit cards so I had to use my friends credit card to obtain the bike. You have to make sure when you dock your bike that you make sure the light turns green or your bike will not be docked and you could inccur high charges. If you keep the bike 24 hours without docking then the cost can be as high as $100 plus. Last day we rode up to the Shedds aquarium and was hoping to ride back once musuem closed, but when we went to the bike station, all the bikes where checked out. Would not recommend riding bikes in the city as a little to dangerous."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/10/2014,"Wonderful Way to Enjoy an Afternoon I'm familiar with this bike model as they are popping up all over the country including my hometown of Washington DC. I rode around town with my sister, from the Magnificent Mile to Lincoln Park to go to the zoo. Chicago is incredible accessible for bikers, and it seemed that the Divvy Bikes were being used a lot. I would definitely recommend picking up a good map from a tourist location to ensure you have a map of bike lanes and paths to make it easier on you."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/07/2014,"GREAT CONCEPT!! Needs some refining On a weekend trip to Chicago this summer, we discovered Divvy bikes. The regular cost is $7 for 24 hours (a HUGE bargain!) but was on sale this weekend for $5! We were excited to rent bikes for our group (7 of us) and ride around town. our first experience was a bad one, unfortunately. You can only rent two bikes per credit/debit card, which we think is really dumb and inconvenient. Some of the bikes would not ""unlock"" from the station (it is self-serv), so, in a nutshell, after over an hour, we could not rent the bikes (and had paid some $35 on various credit cards.) Apparently , the problem had been with that particular bike station (there was MANY, MANY many of these staions around town.) We tried to get bikes (under the same rentals) at a different time and station, and all worked fine. Riding around town was a fantastic experience (as are the bike lanes) and we learned so much in doing so. This is an incredible concept and bargain, but you need to work out the kinks!! Allow as many bikes per card as you want AND have a way of knowing whether the bike/station is functioning properly before you insert money and attempt rental. GOOD IDEA!!"
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/05/2014,"Bad service and kinks need worked out.  4th of July worked ok. However 5th of July we only got to use the service once in the morning to bike to adler planetarium. Which would have been great but the adler station wasn't working and we had to ride our bikes a 1/2 mile to the field museum and walk back the half of mile. When we tried to use them in the afternoon, the machines were down again and we walked to 5 different stations to find a guy taking the bikes because the station was full. However we could not get any bikes and we left to walk all of millennium park and Michigan ave. The guy from Divvy said that we could call the 800# which I already did. Customer service is in Canada and was no help at all. They said a tech would be out in an hour. Whoever runs the DC bikes has it all figured out. I would not recommend for convenience."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/02/2014,"A great way around Chicago It used to be expensive to tour a far-away city by bike; I did so for much of a day for $7, the cost of a day pass to the system (after which all trips under 30 minutes are free...if you want to go farther just check a bike in at a station partway along your route, then check it right back out again!).This all works better in Chicago, where topography is rarely a problem, than a hillier city. [The climate runs to extremes that make choosing good weather essential...]Helmets are recommended but not required (awfully good idea, though)."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/02/2014,"Perfect Way to get around Chicago The divvy bike stations are an absolute must when you feel the need to visit many spots and not walk it all or drive and pay the parking...there are plenty of stations and lots of convenience to the system...even when we had an issue with using our credit card at a station, they gave us a code for a reduced rate when we did find a station."
Chicago,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/02/2014,"Terrible Customer Service Very Disappointed, I rented two bikes from the museum campus and rode them to Navy Pier. Once I made it to that terminal, the station was down and a tech was there to fix the issue. However, I was informed by the workers I can leave the bikes with them and they will text the Supervisor the code on the bikes to let them know we were on time to avoid extra fees. Now my issue is the next day I was charged extra fees so I called customer service and explained my situation. The First rep “Your case will be escalated and someone will contact you within 24 hours. Never got a call back The Second Rep I explained my situation again. I even ask did the previous rep leave notes she stated “NO” and insured me she noted everything plus she will give me a call back the next day if no one has contacted me back. Never got a call back The Third time I call I spoke with a supervisor (which probably was not) I explained myself again, why because there were no notes and this person said he will refund the fees. I emailed customer service got the same response.  “Thank you for contacting us. Your case has been escalated and is currently being reviewed. We need more time to obtain more information about the station involved. We will be contacting you soon about the status of the refund request. Thank you”I called again spoke with another rep I explained the situation once more. At first he could not find my information, and then he said the last time I rode was in 2012 which is very funny because Divvy just had a one year anniversary. Now the first and second rep I spoke with stated they are not authorized to issue refunds, however, the last rep said he issued a refund (I don’t believe that either). Ok so no one leaves notes nor did the Supervisor issue a refund. Basically when a bike station is down no one reports the issue?Divvy Customer Service is horrible…"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/01/2014,"used CHI Bikes app to navigate next station I work in the Loop and commute via Metra. My wife and I took the BNSF Saturday morning express to the Loop, hop on a Divvy around Union Station, and do our relays to lakefront, museum campus, and Cermak Chinatown. CHI Bikes app is helpful in determining what station to go next. We will do six to ten Divvy relays before catching later afternoon BNSF express back to the western 'burb.Divvy can do a better job in providing a more detailed downtown Chicago station map. The one I found on the website only covered North Ave to Museum campus. There is only one station on the Lakeshore Drive side of Grand Park, can use couple more to be tourists friendly.There are a lot more designated bike lanes compared to five years ago, but in some places the bike lane is not in a continuous stretch. In the absence of bike lane such as a crossing a narrow bridge overpass, sometimes we opted to ride on the sidewalk rather than competing with cars and CTA buses. Overall, my wife and I enjoyed Saturday biking around Chicago lakefront. We plan do couple more bike outings in the coming months: far-north route to 4800 north / Lawrence; and far-south route to Hyde Park UC/Museum of S&I."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/30/2014,"Incredibly convenien I had never tried these bike rental kiosks before, but I decided to give it a try rather than taking cabs and the L around the city. Boy, was I surprised!The commute from the Loop down to Mc Cormick would have been $5 each way on the electric train, probably $20 for a cab and simply too far to walk (3 miles?). By bike it was an easy 10 minute trip while you rode along the banks of Lake Michigan. It was spectacular and such a great way to get some modest exercise while enjoying the glorious Spring weather.I also used Divvy to try out a great Indian restaurant across town and to later rent a car at Union Station. It was just to convenient and affordable, I just couldn't believe it. If you're tired of staring out of car windows or noisy trains, give these Divvy bikes a try. You just may change the way you get around downtown Chicago forever!"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/22/2014,"Best way to see Chicago! I cannot say enough good things about this service! My husband I were visiting our daughter and we were able to bike to Pilsen, Wicker Park, Navy Pier and all along the lakefront. Yes, the 30 minute time limit is a drawback, however the docking stations are plentiful and the Divvy app is invaluable for locating the closest stations! BYOH-bring your own helmut!"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/16/2014,"Divvy is awesome BUT... what you need to know before you rent Before we get a summer full of tourists reviews about how frustrating Divvy is and how the 30 minute time limit is too short, I thought I'd be a helpful Chicagoan and give some background and tips.First, Divvy was never meant to be a service for tourists to ride up and down the lakefront all day. Divvy is essentially for what is referred to as ""the last mile"". For example, my dentist is a mile from the brown line stop so I can walk 20 minutes or I can jump on Divvy. Many Chicagoans also commute on them (if their office is a ways from Union Station for example). Personally, I ride it the roughly 3 miles into downtown from home and back which saves me a crowded train ride and cuts my commute by 20 minutes. So there's some background.If Divvy can also provide a fun and interesting way to see the city for tourists, that is just an added benefit. When I see comments complaining about the 30 minute limit and saying that ""what people use Divvy for is to see the lakefront"" I suspect the commenter is not familiar with urban areas and does not understand the service.So how and why can you use Divvy on a trip to Chicago?1. you're in a small group (< 4). Most Divvy stations rarely have 4+ bikes available. Why? Because bikes come and go and people are jumping from one place to the other.2. you're comfortable on a bike. Divvy bikes are heavy...so that people don't steal them and because they were never meant to be used to toodle around the lakefront for hours. I run marathons and it took me a week of commuting for my quads not to burn. Also, Chicago drivers are getting better but they still tend to speed around cyclists and not look before opening doors.3. you understand the system. $7 for 24 hrs does NOT mean you get the bike for 24 hrs. Divvy doesn't want bikes out of the system for 24 hrs. Also, they don't want you locking them up (or potentially getting them stolen). Re-dock the bike and get a new one when you need it. (Yes, I understand the lines can be long and check in is a process. Because the system is aimed towards annual members who can grab a bike and go that last mile...)4. you've downloaded an app to find stations and available bikes. Divvy doesn't have an app but they do share data freely so many apps are available by developers using the data. This will allow you to plot out where you're going and ensure there are bikes and/or free docks. If you don't know what an app is, I definitely don't recommend that you Divvy =)If you're in a sizeable group and/or want to ride around the lakefront all day, parking it, picnicking, visiting the zoo, etc, rent an actual bike. I don't know the services' names but I'm certain there is at least one on Navy Pier and area bike shops likely do the same."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/16/2014,"Poor kiosk format Bikes are what they are, locations are good but the format at the kiosk is very poor for day passes. A group of us (6) would spend 10-20 minutes at each kiosk trying to get it to accept credit cards. Had to call them to get overages waived due to full or inoperable locking stations. Need to work out kinks to make more user friendly for tourists. Would rent bike with lock next time if same format at kiosk Great city though!"
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,06/11/2014,"Divvy- A little frustrating Great idea for active people like me and my husband, but they need to work out a few kinks. During our initial rental, the transaction did not go through so we had to call the hotline to get it sorted out. Also, the 30 minute time limit is a bit stressful especially when the drop off area is full and you have to find another (which happened to us and a few other people at the Navy Pier location). I loved the app that helped find the drop off locations. It was very easy to use and helpful."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/08/2014,"Great way to see a lot of the city Rented Divvy bikes when I was visiting friends who live in Chicago. In just a couple hours, we were able to see most of the sites in the Loop, down to Navy Pier, and around Museum Campus. I was shocked at how much I could see in such a short time. You definitely get a different view of the city riding down the streets than you would riding the L or sitting in the backseat of a cab. There are quite a few apps to help you find local stations, just make sure your phone doesn't run out of battery! It also helped that my friends, the locals, knew where docking stations were. Customer service isn't great, but if you can't dock your bike for some reason, they can extend you another 15 minutes. There are a LOT of stations around, so the next one is usually only 5 minute walk away.Most of the city is pretty flat so it was a very easy ride, especially for me and I am quite out of shape and don't do any regular exercise. This was definitely a fun experience and I'd absolutely recommend it to anyone. I hope other cities I visit have similar programs!"
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/05/2014,"Bike around Chicago and see so much I am from Chicago and a member of the Divvy program which is run the same way as the Capital Bikes program in D.C. along with some other city bike programs.Things to know:*You can buy a 24 hour or 3 day pass*This pass is good for unlimited use in that time frame however, you must re-dock your bike every 30 minutes in order to not be charged excess usage fees*You swipe a credit card to get started following the onscreen instructions*You will receive a 5 digit code which you can use to unlock any of the bikes at the station*Be aware that if a bike needs servicing, the seat may be turned around to show that it should not be selected or the red light will be lit so you cannot un-dock it*I suggest you set your seat height, numbered for future rental use, and any bags in the open sided basket before you enter the code to remove the bike*To remove the bike you may have to lift the rear of the bike to angle it out of its dock*Get on, make sure the bike work, watch for traffic and roll*Re-dock your bike, go back to the kiosk and re-swipe your credit card to get a new release code to take a bike back out. The wait time to re-dock and get a new bike is about 30 seconds I believe. Use the same credit cardI highly recommend you download the free app CycleFinder which will show you the location of other docks and offers a timer. There are 3000 Divvy's and about 300 stations mostly in the Loop, Near north, north and near west sides of the city. There are some south in Pilsen and Hyde Park as well. It’s a great way to roll around Chicago, however you need to be certain you stay on streets and not end up on Lake Shore Drive. Rules of the road apply and you should not ride on Michigan Ave. as well as a safety precaution. Be smart, there are plenty of bike lanes and easier streets to ride to get to where you need to go. Do not leave your bike unattended as you are responsible for it. Be courteous when you ride and do not run over pedestrians, they have the right of way over cyclists. Have fun and be safe!If you are a cyclist and interested in riding with others, please check out ChicagoCyclingClub.Org for scheduled free rides in and around Chicago"
Chicago,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,06/04/2014,"She's a beast, I call her Divvy Cool concept. Gave it a whirl with mixed results. 24 hour pass, but you only get the bikes for 30 minute segments. If you want to joyride, find a real rental place. If you want to get around town and not hoof it, this will do the trick. 30 minutes isn't a lot of time to gain a real long distance unless you are on Lakeshore trail. A bike map of Chicago would have been helpful. Dearborn goes one way north with a dedicated SAFE bike lane. I would guess there is a south bound as well. The bike is a BEAST. Heavy and not great for weaving in and out of large crowds. Found it much more enjoyable early in the AM with no one around. These stations are all around, and some are staffed with employees to help. Some of the bikes I had trouble adjusting the seat. They are rentals, and as Seinfeld said, ""give me the insurance because I am going to beat the h#ll out of this"". I liked it, wife did not if that helps."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/29/2014,"Great way to see the city! Instead of driving or taking a 45 minute cab ride 6 miles to Wrigleyville, we decided on the Divvy bikes. It was a beautiful day and the perfect idea! The only downside to the rental is the 30 minute time limit. If you don't dock the bike within 30 minutes and get a new code, then you get charged an extra $2.00. It can be tricky to find a Divvy bike station."
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/29/2014,"Once you check em out it's great we had some difficulties checking the bikes out because of the computer, but after that it was GREAT! We used the bikes (on and off) for the whole day and we loved it. The bikes are good for adults and older teens if you stick to the bike paths. "
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/28/2014,"Great Transportation option, great bargain - $7 for 24 hours (remember to return it to a station every 30 minutes.) I am not a visitor so I was not at a busy site. There was a little bit of learning the first time I used it and it was dark adding to my confusion. Once I I got the hang of it it was great. I picked up a bike when I got off the subway at the Illinois Center, dropped the bike off a work. At lunch ran an errand to a book store - dropped the bike off 2 blocks away and then found a divvy next to the store. Rode back to the Illinois center to renew my driver's license. Rode back to work. then rode back to the El when the day was over.It looks like they are expanding the system. More bikes are at the Divvy locations near me - looks like it is doubled. One hang up was when there was someone video taping the system and I had to shoo her away so I could get a bike. I had no trouble with my credit cards but it is good to know about the 2 bike limit per card. I am planning to buy the 1 year membership for $75. Sounds like a good deal. I can use it everyday to ride from El to work.One concern - you need to bring your own helmet."
Chicago,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/26/2014,"Great concept, poor execution While on a trip to downtown, having family from out of town, we rented five bikes on Lake Shore Drive. We found the $7/ day price was reasonable and bikes were solid but that is where good part of review ends. Onto the bad part. First, at busy locations there is always a line. Many are first time users, like us, so check out takes forever. With only one terminal be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes. In addition, card readers on the terminal are horrible and reject most of transactions. As credit card swipe is the last step in the check out, you go thru multiple screens entering info to get ""can't read your card"" message at the end. Many patient folks tried number of times but others walked away. Second, if you are renting multiple bikes, you need multiple cards as there is a limit of two per card. After the check out you get a code to unlock your bike, but as the check out process takes forever, you may get code on one card, but by the time you get another one on another your five minutes may be up on the first one. As the customer service on the phone couldn't help you need to get in line again to get a set of new codes....another 15-20 minutes. Third, the 30 minutes limit puts you always in rush not knowing where the stations are or if there will be space to return them causing a bit of anxiety. They will charge you $2 per bike if you don't ""check them in"" before your 30 minutes are up. Fourth, getting or returning 5 bikes can be a huge challenge as either there are not enough bikes at the station or not enough empty ports to return them. In summary, rent at your own risk. Be prepared to got thru pains but riding the bike in the city is fun."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/24/2014,"Divvys for Dummies - what you need to know! Confusing the first time, but so worth the ride!! What we learned:1. Bring all of your credit cards The machine is picky and would not accept some of our Visas2. You can rent 2 bikes on one credit card. If you want to rent 2 more, you MUST use another credit card3. Your code is typed on the bottom of the receipt, so you do not have to memorize it4. Type in your code and wait for the green. Pull back bike tire up first, then the whole bike5. ****When you renew. Return bike, insert your credit card and hit ""REQUEST ADDL CODE"" . You will get a new code on the receipt, enter it, and you're good to go!!!Happy cycling!"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/12/2014,Great idea! We rode for miles and miles... enjoyed the convenience of so many Divvy kiosks around the city.  Great way to experience the city!  We used a 24 hours pass... I think it was $7?
Chicago,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/27/2014,"Conceptually great; pragmatically flawed Terrific way to see Chicago assuming you can go with the flow and deal with chaos. This new bike system deserves support, because it’s much more ecological and fun to ride bikes than to travel like snails on buses or, even worse, moles in the underground subway. Instead of identifying and catching the right public transport, we decided one day to try out the Divvy bikes and simply head in the direction of the Willis Tower. Because it was Easter Sunday, traffic was minimal, and it was great to take advantage of the weather outdoors. Once we arrived, we locked up the bikes in the nearby station, walked around, and acted like tourists. Then we decided to ride across town to get a view *of* the Willis Tower from the Hancock. So as customary, we dutifully reentered the same credit card into the dispensing machine, renewed our codes, chose two new bikes, adjusted the seats, and rode quickly through different sections, along the river, etc. It was all very pleasant.Unfortunately, the Achilles’ heel of Divvy Bikes is the system, itself. It’s new and has issues. First and foremost, it’s not always easy to find docking stations. There may be an App for this, but we didn't have it. As a result, we were always at the mercy of our eyesight, someone in the neighborhood, or our sixth sense. Don’t assume that just because you want to go to an attraction, there’s going to be a place to park right next door. And a Divvy Bike isn't something you want to park just anywhere. For one thing, you get penalized after 30 minutes. For another, you’re liable for $1,200 if it gets stolen. Second, it’s invariable that things can and will go wrong. For example, after we left the Hancock Tower, we couldn't find a docking station. When we finally did, it wouldn't accept our credit card. The system – like many others in Chicago – was plagued by software upgrade quirks, at least this is what was explained to me over the phone by one of the many Divvy folks whom I called during our two rentals. On this particular occasion, we had to walk to the next docking station which was several blocks away and, again, hard to find. After at least a mile of searching, we found one, but by that point, we felt as if we could have made it home by foot.The next day, we docked our bikes at the museum plaza near the Field Museum. It had taken nearly 30 minutes to get there. Unfortunately, to re-rent bikes, we needed to wait in a line of 10 people, some of whom were trying to rent for the first time, all of whom were having problems. The machine was being uncooperative (because of the aforementioned software update issues), and each person tried at least twice before giving up. After waiting for three of four people to fail, WE gave up and walked back to the lake on our own. Eventually, since there weren't any other docking stations, we walked all the way home.On the last day, we tried Divvy bikes again. This time, we rode from the Hotel to the Lincoln Park Zoo along Lake Michigan. It was a great bike ride and required making one bike exchange along the way. There was a Divvy representative there to greet folks and check to see if everything was going alright. At that point, everything was, but when we got to the zoo, we discovered that, contrary to what we had been told, there was place to park. So again, I called Divvy bikes and explained the situation. They granted us an extension so that we could at least spend time at the zoo, albeit with bikes in tow. Finally, on our way back, I got a flat tire, so it took even longer get both bikes back to the closest docking station (which we found out of luck). Once they were docked, I called Divvy Bikes, and they removed the charges, but we were obligated to take a snail bus home from the beginning of Michigan Avenue. The Divvy folks – all of whom were heavily accented -- provide good service and were quite helpful, but they're at the mercy of the Divvy system. Twice they decided that the “resolution” was simply to reimburse us. Frankly, though, $7 isn't much of a hardship, so a refund doesn't make a huge difference. All in all, I believe the concept of Divvy Bikes is fantastic, and I’m glad there are as many bikes as there are today. When it works, it's great. Who can beat riding bikes around the city? Unfortunately, it’s nowhere near the level of perfection required by tourists. Hopefully they can fix the software issues, add more docking stations in less conspicuous places, and maybe introduce an app that can guide you in the right direction and even allow you to renew codes from your own mobile device. Additionally, I would welcome the option of hour-long rentals instead of 30 minutes – say for $12 per day instead of $7 -- which would help happy wanderers relax instead of constantly worrying about where to park."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/21/2014,"Awesome way to go around Chicago Decided to buy a travelzoo voucher to go around Chicago without moving the car and paying for parking. Great deal $4 for 24 hr rental. You can use this for up to 30 mins each time and it is unlimited. Sounds weird cause you want to use the bike for more than 30 mins but it works perfect. The bikes are good for visiting places and dropping them at their stations which are almost every 3 blocks in downtown Chicago. So we went to Navy Pier drop the bike, come back and grab the bike and ride to magnificent mile and drop the bikes, do shopping, then grab the bikes, go to the French market, etc. You save a lot of time by moving with the bikes and it is a lot of fun. Normally the price is $7 per day.Also I don't trust Chicago drivers but they are pretty good since there is bikers all over the city. I was uneasy at the beginning but it went away after the first ride.Tip: bring your smartphone cause that helps you find all the stations where to drop and pick up the bikes and also it helps you find the spots you want to stop. Also you need a credit cardNext time I will totally do it again"
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/26/2013,"Excellent way to get around the city This is a great way to see Chicago at your own pace and on your own itenerary. For a few dollars ($7 when I was in Chicago) you can get a day pass and all you need to do is bike from one location to the next withing 30 minutes. There are plenty of locations all over the city and there is always one close to the major sights. If the location does not have open slots to return the bike, you get another 15 minutes to return it to the next station. Get the online app for your SmartPhone to see where the locations are and how many bikes and open slots are available. Once you return your bike, you can immediately take a new one. Great way to see Chicago if you are a little bit familiar with the city."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/22/2013,"If you don't have a bike in Chicago you can get it here. I own a biking company in Morocco, so I like to see what other cities have. Divvy was a great way to get around the city. You have to drop the bikes off every so often but totally worth it. They're heavy, but they should be with the weather and wear and tear I'm sure they go through. I would definitely recommend people give it a shot. I'm going to see how we can bring these to Marrakech."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/05/2013,"Great way to see the city I wanted to bike around the city while on vacation to see the neighborhoods. Rather than bring a bike I was told by a friend about DIVVY. The bike stands are very accessible. I used my credit card and away I went. I am 6 ft 3 and I was able to raise the seat so I was riding comfortably. Three gears made for easy peddling. In the center city you have to be alert, but the marked bike lanes are a big help. As a first time rider I also received a discount coupon from a Divvy attendant who happened to be at my station. I'll be taking another ride with them for sure."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/01/2013,"convenient, fun, cheap for $7 I got to use a terrific bicycle whenever I wanted for 24 hours. An excellent bargain.as long as you park the bike within 30 minutes of checking it out, there is no extra charge beyond the $7 membership. several times I would stop and swap bikes within minutes, it's a minor hassle to enjoy such a flexible solution.You can take the L somewhere, grab a bike, tour, park, take a boat tour, grab a different bike, L, different bike, etc.... you get the idea. Bikes are plentiful and easy to find with the free smartphone app (I used the Android version, it worked flawlessly)riding along the lakefront is a wonderful way to kill some time and get some excercise."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/30/2013,"Best way to get around Chicago This program is terrific and very easy to navigate. We rode all over the city. It's a lot more fun than public transportation, and not expensive."
Chicago,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/09/2013,"Rent a Bike (DIV-VY) Chicago has implemented a bike rental system that is super cool. You get your bike at one station and return it at another place. This are very confortable bike and easy to ride. The city has many bike lanes. It is a covinient and affordable way to move around in this city. Read the instructions well so you do not get a penalty fee.This are easy, affordable and covinient."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/18/2019,"Legal fraud, bunch of crooks Hired the bike for the first time last weekend to got to the park for a couple hours. Thought I'd pay 12$ or something for the whole day. Ended up being charged $47 for 2.5 hrs !! Called customer service and spoke with a super aggressive lady that wouldn't even let me speak. Obviously I was told that I had accepted the terms and conditions at the kiosk, hence I was on the hook. Not sure what the intent is to have such a service in the city - if it is to reduce pollution we are not moving in the right direction - I will never use it again ! This is what I call a legalized robbery..."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/17/2019,"I will never use Citibike again My husband and I wanted to spend the day exploring the cherry blossoms in Central Park. We had numerous problems with using citibikes. First of all we needed 2 bikes. We are from out of country so we’re only using my phone due to roaming fees. You can only rent 1 bike on your app??? What??? We had to use the kiosks to rent the other one and it wasn’t easy - took us about 10 minutes to finally get another one!! Now we only had 20 minutes before having to return the bike to a station (they only give you 1/2 hour before you have to dock your bike). Because you are not able to use your bikes on the smaller paths in Central Park, we rode for 15 minutes then had to walk our bike through a path to get to another docking station. Same deal - dock our bikes, get another code through the app, and takes a while before I could get the second one from the kiosk. So we ride again for 20 minutes then look for the next docking station. We get to it only to find there are NO BIKED available at that station. Yes we could ride to the next station but the app shows no bikes there either. And of course you are incurring extra fees of $4 for every 15 minutes you are over the 30 minute. Oh and on the kiosk - I could only buy a 3 day or week pass, not a one day!!! Again - WHAT?!?? So anyway we ended up walking for the second half of the day even though we had paid for a day pass!!! NOT user friendly, 1/2 hour is NOT long enough, kiosks need to be more user friendly (at every kiosk I had people asking ME how they worked), we incurred extra fees because we could not get to the next kiosk in 30 minutes. I really felt like this was a huge money grab and we did NOT get value for the money we spent. We likely actually rode the bikes for about 45 minutes and felt like we were always having to look for the next station. I would search a bike rental place next time and rent by the hour or day! Not cool at all Citibike!!!"
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,04/08/2019,"As a touris, a half hour is not enough Need more time between getting a new bike. A half hour is not enough time. Spend too much time worrying about getting to the next bike and returning to a place that will have a docking station available. Love riding bikes during the weekend with less traffic but it is a hassle for someone who doesn’t know their way around. The bikes we rode were nice and easy to ride. Learning how to properly dock the bike is tricky. If I lived there it would be better."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,03/21/2019,"A great & affordable way to see the City! While on a 4 day trip to NY my husband and I were a little apprehensive about cycling in a big city but on day 3 we gave it a go and it was the best decision! Getting from A to B was so much easier and we opted to spend the extra and always used the electric models. The bikes were such a quicker option and by ensuring we docked every 30 mins we were never charged additional fees. We used them again on Day 4 to bike across the Brooklyn Bridge, a quick Pizza stop and bike back - an amazing experience with great memories!When we return next year we will get 3 day pass now we know how it works - make sure you download the App beforehand and get use to it - the map showing available docks & electric bikes is invaluable.Really good affordable fun! "
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,03/01/2019,"Certainly an experience We rented two bikes to get us around NYC. As you can't hire two bikes via the app we had to do one online and one via the kiosk which was annoying but not a huge issue. We first took out the bikes to cycle back over Brooklyn Bridge which was lovely, there is a docking staton at the other side so this was nice and easy. Once we got into the city however, our experience changed somewhat. The roads are so so busy and so are the cycle lanes (which are hard to find even when you use the app). We ended up coming out of the city and cycling up from battery park to West 46th street along the side of the Hudson. This riverside park has a brilliant cycle lane and is much quieter and safer than trying to battle the traffic in the city.The bikes are very heavy and can tire you out easily if you aren't used to cycling.They are however, good value for money, easy to use and there are lots of bike parks. 30 mins is nowhere near long enough though!! I wouldn't recommend them in Central park as the bike lanes are very limited and cycling on footpaths is not allowed, plus, by the time you get into the park and get going, it's time to start heading out to swap the bike before your 30 mins is up!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,01/29/2019,"Very good if a little expensive We were very, very impressed with the Citi bikes in New York. Yes it is expensive compared to other schemes but the cycle paths were brilliant, the app was very useful and there were docking stations every few blocks, so much easier to use than in London - I would strongly recommend. It is a far faster way of seeing the City than walking."
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,01/16/2019,"Meh We were excited to ride bikes in NY, but this Citi Bike System seems geared more towards locals. The system was confusing for us and thankfully a maintenance person happened to be nearby to help us pay for and unlock our bikes. The Citi System is good for getting from point A to point B, but that is all I would recommend them for. The bikes have to be ""re-checked"" out every 1/2 hour and it was difficult to find a station to do this is when you don't know the city you are in. Also the bikes were a bit stiff to ride with no turning radius. I guess I would recommend this to a local who needed a quick trip to work or the grocery. Not necessarily tourist friendly, IMO."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,01/13/2019,"Sh**ty bike Sh*tty bike! They’re always broken and customer service is non-existent, but sometimes it’s the best of bad options. Be better citi bike. I know you wont."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,01/10/2019,"Terrible experience It is terrible. I purchased a one day pass of 12$ and used the bike for 3 hours. It supposed to be returned every 30 minutes!!! However, my cellphone ran out of the battery and I couldn't find their rack to return every 30 minutes. So, they charged me an extra 60 dollars for that. It means I paid 72$ for just 3 hours. Citibike was my most terrible experience in the NYC."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,01/08/2019,"Scam We rented three bikes for one day on the 27th of December and the cost was $39 with tax. We returned the bikes within 24hr permitted period. On our return, we checked our credit card statement and there was a $39 charge and $108 charge for the 31st of December. We left New York on the 30th! We went to the Citi Bike website and they came back to us immediately and asked for a few details and then refunded us without any question. My worry is how many people bother to chase Citi Bike for the money 1 or 2 out of every 10? Who knows. Most people take it on the chin and put it down to experience. There are 68 million visitors to NYC every year. SCAM"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/30/2018,The best way to see New York  One of the best and cheaper ways to hang around New York. There are a lot of bicycles and a huge range of docks around the city. I think 30minutes rides are ok to go from one place to another.
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,12/26/2018,"Overcharged Been charged for 2 days rather than one and surprise, surprise the forms to lodge a complaint never open. Also charged another $4 on top of choosing the daily fee as we went over 30 min. What a scam."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/10/2018,"Perfect way to enjoy NYC but be aware of extras We enjoyed Citibike a lot during three days in NY, we think it is the best way to visit Manhattan. Unfortunately, we were charged with extras while the extra time was indeed due to the impossibility of finding docks. We have asked to be refunded because it wasn't our fault, explaining the situation and giving our names and the names of overcrowded stations but the answer was somehow ignoring completely our issues."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/09/2018,"A brilliant way to see NYC  We always get citi bikes and now with the improved app and a network of cycle lanes seeing Manhattan has never been easier.  Simply down load the app, create an account and off you go.  Brilliant !"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/20/2018,Sightseeing Brooklyn & Lower Manhattan My first experience using this type of service. Found it easy to use and locations were everywhere we wanted to go. Simply loved the experience. Pedaled across the Brooklyn Bridge and explored lower Manhattan.
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/11/2018,"Completely Terrifying !!!! It was SOOO much fun though!!! I'm from Toronto originally, so biking in that city takes some getting used to but biking in a crazy city like NYC!?!?? You would either have to be diagnosed with a terminal disease and have only one day to live or have a death wish to die on 42nd and 8th ave if you decide to rent bikes in this city... my LORD!!! Everyone goes in every direction all the time, red lights mean nothing and everyone thinks honking at everyone will actually DO something. Well it doesn't.... The guy you're trying to teach a lesson to isnt getting it..... so get over yourself.We rented two bikes, and unfortunately this app will not let you rent two bikes at the same time.... so we had to use the app for one and the kiosk for the other..... so that is something they could change for sure.The bikes were in good condition, some better then others. The seats with the holes in them were less comfortable then the ones without. The basket in front had a strong bungee cord which held your stuff down pretty good.When we first got to the first station, we didn't know where to put the code..... your code will only have a 1 or 2 or 3 in it. And the key pad is on the left. The kiosk prints out a 5 digit code which after you enter it the light turns green.... HELPFUL TIP.... after it turns green, you have to lift up the bike a few inches so you can unlock it.... they don't tell you that anywhere either...... We didnt have any problems finding bike stations to pick up and drop off. The later in the day it gets however, certain stations around Time Square and Chelsea Market were clear out. I guess that's what the valet Service was for ? NOT sure....Helpful tip??? Try not to go over the 30 min time limit!!!!! IF you do, they charge $4 for EACH 15 min interval you run over. If you have to drop off and pick up right away, just wait to the two minutes to sign it out again. When docking your bike gently put the bike in and lift a few inches so it registers it and make sure the light turns green before you walk away.It's a cool way to see the city, I'm betting that I expended a LOT more calories then what they told you (that was a cool thing on the app) as my adrenalin was pretty high... I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at one point or another..... I would use this service again, it was a little less terrifying around Washington Square and in Greenwich Village, but midtown was not fun during rush hour..... yikes And good LORD buy and where a helmut!!!! "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/04/2018,Very efficient - nice way to see NY Download the app and chose the option that works for your timing. One the one day pass ($12) you need to return the bike to the station after half an hour - not a problem as there are many stations. Good fun
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/31/2018,Sightseeing Best way to get around Manhattan! Riding a bike from the Hudson to East River and crossing the Brooklyn Bridge is a must! Be careful not to ride over 30 minutes each time. Incan get a bit expensive.
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/29/2018,"Efficient, technically well-maintained Every tuime I get to the city I ride the Citibike- they're everywhere, it's quite straight forward, they're in a very good technical condition, there are endless number of stations, so you can always find one close to where you wanna go, and the support through the phone is quick and good. If you're here for 3 days, take the 3-day, and save $12. The 24-hour period is not calendar, but 24 hours from the minute you took them."
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,10/09/2018,"Be Aware of Extra Charges Recently returned from NYC and used Citi bike for our group of four tourists. While the initial process seemed very reasonable and easy, in actuality we had a few issues. 1. You have to ""dock"" your bike in every 30 minutes. This seems like a lot of time until you have trouble finding a docking station with room for your bike. For each 15 minutes in excess of the 30 minutes, there is an extra $4 charge which adds up if you can't find a space to dock your bike before you run out of time. You will have to ride to the next station, where the same problem may repeat. For example, our group was able to dock two bikes at one station, but there was no room for the extra two bikes so two of us rode to the next station. Then we had to walk between stations to meet up. 2. On our return trip we stopped to dock our bikes and found plenty of spaces which was good. Unfortunately, when we tried to release the bikes and continue, the card machine was not working and we could not unlock the bikes. Not to be deterred, we tried walking to the nearest Citi bike station...however, there was only one bike available there. We then walked to the next station and same problem, only two available bikes. At this point we gave up and called an Uber to take us back to our hotel. In the end, instead of an economical day of riding, we ended up with extra charges for the bikes and the cost of an Uber ride. Kind of a ripoff! On the plus side, the bikes were very comfortable to ride and in good shape. Not sure if we would use Citi bike again."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/08/2018,"Great Way to Get Around I use Citibike very frequently to get around for commuting and my daily life. This is a great way to go cross-town or avoid slow subway lines. Be a good rider and be aware of your surroundings, ride on the street and not the sidewalk, let people around you, and watch for people/vehicles on your sides. Be assertive for your safety and efficiency -- the safest place to bike is often in the middle of a lane, but move to the side when it is safe. Watch for people opening doors (especially from ubers/taxis) and taxi drivers moving to the curb to pick up hailers. Use the bell to alert others of your presence (including people jay-walking at crosswalks). The Citymapper app provides convenient directions for bike share."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/04/2018,Excellent Value and Mode of Commuting -NYC I ride Citibike to and from work daily; the only negative is that sometimes there are not enough bikes when I start the trip; and I then walk a few extra blocks. This is still an amazing advantage over traveling by subways - for mental and physical health benefits. I suggest they add a few more bikes to their herd!
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/29/2018,"Although I enjoy using the regular bikes, the ebike has been a major fail.. I visited the upper east side when they rolled out the e-bikes and have seen exactly 7 of them north of 72nd st.But wait, there's more..Each time I saw one, the red light was lit on the docking station..unusable..no explanation why the red light is always on when these things make their unicorn appearance.Someone's not doing their job and ruining the good will that Citibike initially earned.Don't over-hype something in NYC and not deliver on it fully..Just my opinion"
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,09/29/2018,"Great Concept  The concept of citi bikes is great! My business (dog walking) uses them for fast commuting from client to client. We use these bikes everyday, multiple time a day but as of late I feel the reliability and quality has gone down. Eight times out of ten there are either no bikes to be found or there are nothing but unusable bikes at stations. We were also so excited when they introduced the electric peddle assist bikes, but I almost feel like it’s a bad joke. Every time you find one at a station you are left disappointed to find that it is also red lighted and not in service. I feel they need to get a better system in place to keep high demand areas better stocked and keep good, usable bikes in service. Overall we like the service and will continue to use it, but would like to see it better maintained. "
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/25/2018,"Cool Set Up I am very impressed with the Citi Bike operation. We were in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and saw quite a few of the stations. At 1am, we were dropping someone off in the neighborhood. The guy just rented the bike and rode off. I definitely would like to rent one in the future. "
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/23/2018,Be careful of confusing price structure! On the surface this is one of those things that seems amazing and is a great way to see NYC but make sure you read the fine print before you sign up.It's advertised as $12 to hire a bike for a day but like many others what I didn't do is read the fine print and then got hit with unexpected and overpriced fees. We had 2 bikes out for 5 hours and this cost us almost $100! The system is purposely confusing and misleading (evident by the many reviews you can find on the net) so people get hit making the same mistake we did.At its core it's a great idea but at these insane prices it would be almost as cheap taking a taxi everywhere.
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/21/2018,"Totally misleading information and a complete Rip Off!! Totally misleading information at the docking station and a complete Rip Off!! A fee for day hire, that is a fee for a days bike hire! Actually no.. Plus a fee for every minute after 30 mins! Confused? - We certainly were. The fact is that we could not re dock the bikes within 30 mins as there were not any docking spaces available at numerous docking stations in Red Hook, Brooklyn, NY therefore we could not avoid additional charges. You end up cycling around trying to get rid of the bikes, very frustrating, meanwhile every minute is costing you money. We ended up cycling back to the original docking station, hungry, frustrated and much poorer, don't use, take a bus, train, cab or walk! We used the 4 bikes for two hours, we only wanted them for 20 mins, it has cost over a $135.00!!I raised a complaint with the operators, had a 'Dear John' reply back.. Replied to them, checked on progress, informed by the operator the complaint is closed! Terrible customer service. All in all a terrible experience."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/19/2018,"Great way to see NYC  My boyfriend and I just moved to Nyc, and biking around has been a fun way to gain our bearings. I would normally not have any interest in biking in the heat, but wanted to check out the electric bikes. After taking the bikes out a couple times we both got hooked, and just bought annual passes! With fall coming I can’t wait to bike around the different parks. "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/16/2018,Visit Staff at plaza hotel fountain Visit the staff in front of the plaza hotel and they'll show you how to use the bikes and give you an easy to read map. The entrance to central park is right there and once in the park you don't have to worry about cars. I did it today and with a bad back it was easy and the staff makes sure you won't have extra fees.It's hard to understand that some people think for $12 you get to take a bike to your hotel or wherever for 24 hours. Yes you have to return it every 30 minutes but there are stations everywhere a tourist would want to go and the staff make sure you know how to use the bike.
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/16/2018,"Easy transport Used the bikes for Central Park. Lot cheaper than the rental places, but you have to return them every 30 minutes. No big deal. Make sure you know where to switch bikes ahead of time or you may go over the time limit (we were close once). The kid at the kiosk outside CP was really helpful getting us started."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/13/2018,"Best thing to do in NYC!  We just bought day passes from one of the guys selling passes in front of the Plaza Hotel. We went all over NYC... with bike lanes and CitiBike stations literally everywhere, there couldn’t have been a simpler experience. I would definitely recommend biking Central Park, biking to the Met from there, biking along the piers, and across the Brooklyn Bridge. We had the best day! I’m shocked at some of the reviews below. People seem to be complaining when they themselves don’t dock a bike correctly. The light turns green when you dock it right. Very easy. "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/12/2018,"Love Citi Bike :) Annual pass is amazing! I was going to buy a day pass but the nice guy with the citi bike hat let me know about the annual membership and 45 minute rides. I’m only here in New York for 2 months but it will actually save me money. I would be spending the same amount of cash at bike rentals companies for just 4 trips, but now I have UNLIMITED rides throughout the city! Thank you Citibike - best way to explore NYC :) "
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/12/2018,"Don’t give them your credit card info I rented a bike last week in Central Park with them which was fine; this was supposed to be a one time rental for an hour and was charged 3.27$. But now after two weeks there is another charge of 9.80$ for some sort of membership. I call this scam and abusing customer credit card information to sign them up involuntary for membership. Some of us have a super busy full time job and don’t have time to call and cancel unwanted charges, etc This is unprofessional"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/06/2018,"Terrible What a waste of money. After changing the bike 3 times we couldn’t take out all again. The office told me we hadn’t put one back properly. So you can just wait until someone brings it back. We waited 5 hours in which we could not use the bikes we paid for. Then it worked again, we used them and put ir back. Then again the same problem, although we checked on each to put it back properly. The lady on the phone let me feel like an idiot, told me we don’t know how to put the bikes back properly. We couldn’t use them till the next morning.I was very upset because I know we put them back properly and it didn’t work at all. Furthermore they purchased me 120$, the time someone else used the bike. Which should, if you call and tell that you’re not using the bike by yourseld should be stopped.In all I paid 4 bikes and a lot more and didn’t use them plus the customer service is very unfriendly. What a waste of money!!! Do NOT use them!!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/05/2018,Super Easy Fun! The first day in NYC I walked everywhere but there is so much to see. I decided to try out Citibike so I could get around faster. It was great! Super easy and there are spots to park everywhere. I will do this again next time I visit the city-great bargain too!
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/02/2018,"Needs option for kids My older teen and I used this service and it was pretty fabulous. The price was good and it was relatively easy to learn the system. However it was hard to figure out how to rent two bikes because the app thinks it doesn’t offer that functionality yet. At the kiosk station near one of the checkouts it said, “do you want to rent another bike?” So it seems a little dumb the brain does not know what the hand is doing. Also it would be great to have some sort of indicator on the bike of how long you’ve rented it because checking a phone while riding is obviously dangerous. We have younger children who were not with me so it would be great if there were an option for kids to ride. Understandably that’s not their market but as one of the more legitimate rentals out-of-towners would appreciate that."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/27/2018,"Inexpensive, Easy to use, access and return We used the bike to go around Central Park. This is a perfect application. Other vendors charge $15.00/hour. Citi Bikes is much less. These bike are easy to access and return. The bikes are a three speed bike so it is difficult to find the sweet spot for cycling in changing terrain. The bike seems to have more drag in the power train system than what it should be. This maybe connected to the generator to power the LED light around the bike.Having said that, they are perfect for use around the park. You can access them right outside the park, bike around the park, return the bike and be on your way."
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,08/21/2018,"A perfect way of seeing real Manhattan A different but best way to visit all parts of NYC without using buses, subways and taxis. If you are flexible and an average biker, this is the way to go. We used the bikes with young kids however this is not really allowed, we have seen afterwards. Only from 18 years onwards."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/18/2018,Rip Off in NYC What a rip off. The kiosk says $12.00 a day but I wish I read the reviews first. Many people had the same unfortunate experience as I. I definitely would NOT use again. As like buying a used car read the fine print! I called customer service and was told they are not for recreational use. In NYC??? Really?? Now as I see in previous reviews the manager will add some stupid response. Don’t rent use them AND the seats are set at the wrong angle. I kept sliding forward.
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/16/2018,"Best way to see the city - in multiple jumps Riding a bike in Manhattan takes away traffic frustrations and gives an intimacy with neighborhoods that you don’t get from a car/bus. I started at the tip of Manhattan. First hop was short, to the 9/11 memorial and the Oculus. Wow.Then up the west side bike path with all the great views. Another hop got me into and across Central Park. My route is not the key, the point is that I was able to do a segmented trip around Manhattan hitting many of my favorite spots. Just keep an eye on your watch so that you dodge the extra charge for going over 30 minutes. There are so many more docking stations than when I first used the system years ago. It’s amazing how easy and fun it has become. "
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/13/2018,"BE AWARE OF THIS COMPANY... Deceptive day pass There is NO SUCH THING AS A DAY PASS, I was billed $94 for 2 bikes for under 3 hrsBike rentals are in 30 min increments ONLY if you go over 30 min you pay for each additional 15 min, Boycott them"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/09/2018,"Waste of Money!! We rented Citiibike day pass to ride in Central Park and Hudson River. Eventually, despite the day pass $13 (with tax), we got charged an additional $48 pp for riding more than 30 mins per trip! I wish Citibike can be stated more clearly on their app about the extra charge while selecting the day pass ride! What make it worse will be the customer service lady, she will make you feel like an idiot of not reading terms and condition when you approached them... I believed I am not the only one who suffered, wish they have a much better customer service representative! It's just sooooo bad! Other than that, it's very easy to locate a bike, lock and unlock a bike..."
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/04/2018,"buyer beware It is impossible to get out of a membership once signed up. Even if you move out of town with proof (most places accept this and are courteous enough to stop charging you for something you can't use). Bikes are very heavy. Rides are limited in time, eg 30-45 minutes. No guarantee there will be a bike at the station you are hoping for. Can turn into an awkward thing trying to swipe a bike much like taxis sometimes. A nice thought to have a bike share program in NYC but it needs some improvement here."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/04/2018,"Waste of time and money We wanted to rent these seemingly nice bikes to ride through Central Park. I used the kiosk to buy the tickets for a ""24 hour rental"", only to find out after about the every 30 minute dock requirement unless you want to be charged more incrementally bases upon how far over the 30 minutes you go. Why on earth would we rent bikes for a 24 hour period and have to come back every 30 minutes?! Then the ""ambassadors"" showed up to the desk and told us of the alternative. Shouldn't one be there at all times to advise people? He said we could call the number on the kiosk to see if we could cancel that. Called, explained, denied. Terrible customer service on the call, and also there with the ambassador. By this time we had already wasted 20 of the 30 minutes so we docked the bikes and went elsewhere. Waste of $24 and our time. We just wanted to ride for an hour or two through the park, which no matter what we wouldn't have been able to do with the ridiculous 30-minute time limit. I saw the response about keeping availability of the bikes, but any time we passed by any of these rentals, they were always at least 3/4 full. I'd really like to get my $24 back. Because of this, I would not recommend. There are many other rental options for a flat time period and rate."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/31/2018,"NYC The experience was really good! I just don't like that I had to change bikes during each 30 minute ride because I have to be really aware of this every 20 minutes or so because If not I'll be charge. Nevertheless, it is great!"
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/26/2018,"Deceptive I enjoyed exploring the city on Citi Bike. We rode all the way from Central Park North to the South Street Seaport. However, my displeasure stems from the lack of information regarding having to dock the bike every 30 minutes to avoid additional charges. And yes, it's about $4/15 minutes! And no, you cannot get through Central Park north to south or south to north within half an hour... unless you don't want to stop to enjoy the sights within the park.But once we reached the Citi Bike Ambassador at Central Park South(across from The Plaza Hotel), we better understood the program and how it worked. The Ambassadors offer discount options if you download the app."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/22/2018,"Awful customer service and system My boyfriend and I tried three times before finally being able to find a station that functioned. One of the bikes’ tire blew out and we had to walk the bikes to a station nearby. If that isn’t bad enough, by chance, we returned the bikes we were finally able to rent at one of the stations that wasn’t functioning earlier in the night. We watched both bikes light turn green to signify they were docked, only to be told hours later that one didn’t dock. At 11pm at a night, after docking the bikes at 7:50, we were told our only option was to go back to the docking station and “redock” the bike, after being told by the agent they saw us attempting to dock the bike in the system. I have never in my life experienced a more flawed system, nor a more worthless customer service team. There was zero responsibility taken by the customer service team for the blown tire (poor service and maintenance), the non-functioning docking system (again, poor service and maintenance), or the way we were spoken to by the agents. I will NEVER rent a CitiBike again, or recommend to anyone."
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/18/2018,"Great experience but be can get costly My girlfriend and I went to New York in July and used the Citi Bike program. We got a one day pass (24 hours). The downside of the bike program is that you only have 30 minutes to use the bikes before they charge outrageous fees. The app works well for finding bikes and docks, but be mindful of the amount of time you have the bikes checked out so you don't get charged extra."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/14/2018,Ride at central park a waste of money + time The cocept of docking every 30 mins if not you get charged is ridiculous. You end up wasting more money and time riding around central park than walking.
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/12/2018,DON'T HIRE TO RIDE CENTRAL PARK Just been pinged for a further USD38 because we didn't dock the bikes within the 30 minute time frame - there is no way you can ride central park like this so don't do it...pay a little extra and hire bikes from another operator. I feel totally ripped off as it wasn't clearly stated. I will never support them again as it's not at all tourist friendly.
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/09/2018,"Be careful! It will cost more than you thought Be careful with the day pass! If you don't dock the bike after 30 minutes, they will double charge you for 2 days! Customer service is terrible! Don't even try this or you will cost you more money than taking Uber or taxi!"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/09/2018,"dissapointed I loved my biking experience. my husband and I biked around twice. once by the brooklyn bridge park and once by long Island city park. it was wonderful. we were very careful to hit the biking station every 25minutes not to incur any unnecessary charges. later in the week as i was looking through my bank statement I saw a $4.36 fee. I called customer service and was told that i locked the bikes in at 32minutes. I asked to speak to an advisor so maybe she can do something on my behalf because it was really not intentional and it was my first time using those bikes and i wanted to really be positive about the experience. Also, I was maybe a minute late, but im human and its hard to hit the second mark, so it was so frusterating that i wasnt helped and after the phone call i felt so horrible the way i was treated by the supervisor. I mean, I might not have been a minute late, it just sometimes takes time until the bike gets locked into place which may have taken up these crucial few seconds to be charged extra. The woman I spoke to on the phone was pretty rude to me. I wish there would be someone i could speak to other than her to explain myself and to get a more understanding and helpful response.So overall my biking experience was great, but customer service and the supervisor was really mean to me."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/02/2018,"Convenient and easy We were in Manhattan for 3 days so I got the 3 da pass for $24. I found it easy and convenient to use. As some of the previous reviews stated, you will need to redock every 30 min on long rides. This just means you need to plan your route in advance. Get the app, set a 20 minute timer on your phone and you shouldn’t have any problems. There are lots of docks all over the city. I had no problems. One word of warning... take bags off bike before racking or at least make sure the straps of said bags aren’t locked in the rack with the bike. Enough said. "
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/02/2018,"Good Service until there is a problem App would not work twice in a week. Customer Service basically said tough luck. When it works, it is very good. However, now it seems I can not rely upon it. They also often run out of bikes."
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/01/2018,"Learning curve  They are fun to ride around the city, but you are limited to 30 minute rides. You need to plan for that and it takes getting used to but we made it work with just my wife and me. For example, to get from Midtown near Central Park to Washington Square, 30 minutes isn’t enough time if you obey traffic signals. Over 30 minutes it just keeps charging your credit card overage fees of $4 at 15 minute increments.Go figure a bank gets into bike rentals and figures out a way to charge you extra fees!!!But just like your credit and bank accounts if you keep close tabs and a nice cushion you can avoid extra fees. But sometimes crap happens even to the best of us and you get dinged. What sucks is if the place you planned to stop doesn’t have any empty docks. You can get a 15 minute extension to find another station but it is still inconvenient and it just kind of sucks. Most of the busy tourist places have a few dock stations within a few blocks but it still ruins your mojo.The other scenario that sucks is when you need to dock and there are no other bikes at that station. You don’t want to be a jerk but you also don’t want to give up the bike if you are trying to get somewhere. There is a 2 minute waiting period until you can check a bike out again, specifically so if someone is waiting they can take it. Fine if you are in a cool place but shady if it is dark out and you aren’t so sure about your surroundings. So you look at the app and try to stretch it to a station with more bikes...hope you make it on time!!!Overall, I would use it again but it might not be for everyone. "
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/18/2018,"My wife and I got a one-day bike rental, it was, indeed, a trap They say $12 for the day but if you don't put one of the bikes back within 2 hours (i.e. 2 hours and 32 minutes) you get a second charge of $39.20. Its a trick and outrageous...giving cycling in NYC a bad name."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/17/2018,Works for me Citibikes are to go from place to place. Easier and faster than walking. It’s a form of transportation versus a bike tour. It’s excellent for short rides. 
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/14/2018,"You will regret this, it’s a trap For $12 a day, you are better off riding via Metro or walking. Only realised the mistake when I saw the credit card statement back home. Loved NY but the Citibike experience was the only one I truly regret taking part."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/10/2018,"Absolute Joke My girlfriend and I rented the bike in Harlem and drove down the entire Central Park. There wasn't any advise at the citi bike station, that you have to bring it back within 30 minutes. So we have to pay 35 dollars now! I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY FOR RENTING A BIKE. Better try out others!"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/01/2018,Rip off We used the bikes for one day. We were very aware of the 30 minutes time frame. 1st ride was 35 min and 2nd was 26 min. Was expecting an additional charge of $4 but got charged $26! No response from my email to Citibikes! 
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/01/2018,"If the city cared about the environment, bikes would be affordable One would think with all the problems NYC has with traffic and public transportation that it would do whatever it could to make alternative, efficient modes of transit affordable and available. This would be great if it were actually affordable."
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,05/31/2018,"Beware of learning curve and finicky hardware This is a good deal monetarily, but it takes a bit of patience and awareness. You must dock your bike every 30 minutes or get charged $4 per extra 15 minutes. We used full day use option, a good deal. To dock correctly, roll front tire into the docking station, and lift the rear of the bike by the seat until the lights on the docking kiosk light up and the kiosk shudders. Otherwise it will not register as being docked, and you will be charged. Plan your bike trip so you can easily reach another kiosk within 30 minutes. Once you get the hang of it, it generally works well. Any problems, call the Help number."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/30/2018,"CITI bike SCAM! Rented a bike for 24 hours. Just noticed a bill for $53...We called CITI Bike customer service... Some woman who was VERY well aware of this scam charge said I was supposed to dock my bike every 30 mins!!!!!!!!! ""Can I help you with anything else?""...WTF? They know this is a scam!!!! But refuse to refund. I even got a notice my 24What a joke! What a scam. Who wants to dock their damn bike every 30 mins. Ridiculous!"
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/28/2018,"Great ride on citibike on New York streets but cautious of every 30 minutes docking when u t a day pass for new visitors We just thought to have fun with ride and see the beauty of the newyork streets .. it was soooo easy to book your bicycle with citibike using ur credit card and mobile number.. but only tedious part was docking back for each 30 minutes when u take day pass with rent of @12$+tax total 13+$.. If u don't dock ur bicycle within 30 minutes of ur each ride then u will be charged 4$ for each 15 minutes u spent after every 30 minutes of beginning of ur each ride.. which means we r forced to dock ur bike within 30 minutes time frame.. which makes u clicking clock in ur brain .. when u r a first time vistor u miss enjoying ride as u always forced to think of docking ur bike rather njoying ur ride... but u will get plenty of docking stations all the time in ur way where ever u rome in new York City..Except that u will enjoy a lot on bike ride..I suggest first time vistors at least do a one time bicycle ride in NY street for a first time visitor.. don't worry u have nice and plenty of dedicated line to ride in almost all streets.Regards,Krishna"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/09/2018,"Enjoy the views of the bridges We walked from Times Square to one of many Citi Bike kiosks in the city... we walked practically straight over on 42nd to 1st street then 1st down to 35th.The area between 41st and 38th is an empty lot and I would avoid the area after dark however, it was safe enough in the day.We rented it from the kiosk at FDR Drive & E 35 St and we rode down alongside the East River to Front St & Peck Slip... Google map directions state it's about 19 minutes however we took our time, stopped for water and took some photos so for us it was about 45 minutes...For us to dock where we did, you will have to cross the road just above Peck Slip... which is just after you get under the Brooklyn Bridge.It's a great way to see the majority of the bridges and just have a relaxing day in New York without the hustle bustle of the busy New York streets.I would highly recommend this for anyone going to visit New York and just do something outside of the steropical tourists, which we were anyways, but found out about this so it definatey took us out of that 'sterotype' mode.The online Citi Bike map is awesome to use and the mobile phone app is awesome as well because you can see how many bikes are at a certain kiosk as well as any open docks. Very easy to rent the bikes... most if not all rental areas are stations that accept credit cards; you get a code and then enter that code on any bike dock, remove the bike and awayyyyyyy you go!!!!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/06/2018,"Good service, customer service very understanding I’ve got a ride with my family in Central Park and it was wonderfull.Some rules in the rental are not so clear at the first sight so I invite to read it carefully and all works fine.To solve some trouble the customer services has been very quick and helpfull."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/04/2018,"The ideal way to explore NYC Just terrific, cycling through Manhattan and Brooklyn. Clear bicycle paths all throughout, friendly traffic and the citibikes were all very comfortable. Picking up and returning the bikes couldn’t be easier. Highly recommended, especially if you’re an avid cyclist like me ;)"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/03/2018,"So Easy and So Useful! Make sure you understand the rules before you sign up!!!! I got a day pass for $12 USD and actually got 2 of them over the course of 48 hours because it was cheaper than buying all those single rides. Keep in mind that it's unlimited <30 min trips! All you have to do is bike for 29 mins and then put it into the dock, wait 2 mins, then take it out again! that simple! but if you don't, then you're just inviting insane charges on your credit card. I used it all day for 2 straight days and probably covered like 45 km biking around Central Park, midtown, downtown, Brooklyn and all the way up the west side highway, among many other neighbourhoods. It's so easy to use it's crazy! Also get familiar with the bikes before you set off. Some of the newer ones have an updated gear system where you just turn the crank and there's really no set gear it just progressively gets harder or easier, which I liked better than having 3 separate dedicated gears to go through. The seats were comfortable and easy to adjust if need be. No complaints. It was 100% more fun and easier and cheaper than riding the subway, but not quicker so keep that in mind. You can literally go anywhere you want with these things, there are 0 boundaries! and for that price, it is a no brainer!"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/25/2018,Never ever again! We rented two bikes for 12$/day each. What a shock when we discovered that you need to stop each 30min otherwise you are charged extra money for each 15min. We were using similar service in other cities but never experienced this.Next time we are definitely using other options (we saw a good deal close to central park 5$/full day with a different company).Really dissappointed :( Jana&Igi
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/24/2018,"Be aware!!! They steal your money!! So, I used to love renting a citibike to go around the city but what happened last Saturday really pissed me off. First, they said they were offering a “free” ride from 9 am- 3 pm because it was “Earth Day” so I decided to take advantage of it. I signed up, then received an email where I had to click on the link to get my free pass. I clicked on it and did everything it asked me to, which was basically get the app and sign up. Then there was no further instructions on the email or the app. I went ahead and used my card to get the bike because I figured they would link the card/ phone number with the pass I “downloaded”. I proceeded to enjoy the day and made sure I returned the bike before the 30 minutes went up so I wouldn’t get charged and even waited 2 minutes in order to get another bike. I returned the last bike around 2:40 pm. Made sure the light turned green, as usual and that was it. Then 2 days later, I looked at my bank account and there was 2 charges from Citibike, one for $13 and another one for $48!! I called to see what those were about and was told that the $13 was the daily pass. I explained I had signed up for “Earth Day” and she says “you should have called us so we could tell you how to get the code for that.” When I said there was no instructions telling me I was supposed to call, she said there was nothing she could do because I used the bike and I was supposed to have called. I let this one slide, even though I didn’t like the fact she can see I signed up for it and the hours I had a bike and still does nothing about it AND we’re supposed to guess what to do instead of receiving an email with clear instructions to call them, but whatever... I did use the bike, so that’s fine! When I asked about the $48, the lady said it was because I did not return the bike for 2 hrs!!! I DID!!! And I waited for the light!! I told her where I returned them and I even waited for the 2 minutes to get another bike!! She said all she could do was to refund me $8!! Are you serious??? This is so sad!! I used to love riding these in the city! "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/23/2018,"The only way and I mean the only way to see New York  What a totally and utterly sensational way to see Manhattan! I cannot overstate just how good this was. I covered around 50 miles in two days seeing more than I could possibly have seen walking or using the subway. This goes down as one of my best travel experiences ever and I have travelled a lot! Man! What city! Definitely, absolutely use Citibike!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/17/2018,A great service I love these bikes. The best way to get around NYC. Service was easy to use and convenient. More bake stations would always be welcome. I highly recommend using these bikes.
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/16/2018,"Cost effective, and after walking best value travel option for transversing Manhattan. We got the $12 day pass. The pass allows for unlimited 30 minute or less rides. Take a few minutes prior to using CitiBike in becoming familiar with the smart phone app. This is a very powerful tool. App has a map that displays Citi bike stations. Will display in real time amount of bikes and docking spaces at each station.Used the Citi Bike app in conjunction with NYC department of transportation bike map app . NYC has made great strides in accommodating bicycle travel, and Citi Bike allows you to take advantage of this. For those uncomfortable riding in traffic there are numerous protected bike only paths that are clearly marked on NYC DOT bike map. Suggest prior to taking a ride know your destination station, Manhattan is very easy to navigate. In the event a station does not have any docking station there is an option to get an additional 15 minutes , although I never needed to use that option. If going on an extended ride you can always ride for 29 minutes dock bike.....wait 2 minutes get another code and continue riding. As a tourist didn't mind taking in the sites for a few minutes between rides. In the event you get distracted after receiving your code and you don't enter in time , get another code....that did happen to me. A tip I would like to share is that if you are going to Brooklyn use the Manhattan bridge as opposed to the Brooklyn Bridge. The Brooklyn Bridge on a nice day will be a massive wave of humanity that is difficult to ride through as many do not adhere to staying out of bike lane ! The bikes are heavy, sturdy ,and stable with adjustable seat post with markings that allow for quick setting when changing bikes. Bikes have a front rack that can hold a small day/backpack and be secured with a strap.Summary of our day pass was 6 rides for a total of 18 miles average time of ride 23 minutes. Bike helmets not supplied...bring your own !"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/16/2018,"FRAUDDDDDDD DO NOT BUY ANY BIKES THEY LIKE TO OVERCHARGE PEOPLE FOR NO REASON IM HIGHLY UPSET I RENTED TWO CITIBIKES ON THURSDAY FOR A DAY PASS OF $12, altogether I paid 26 at the moment, on Sunday I seen charges for $60 I called customer service and the guy was rude and talked over me not helping me understand why $60 was charged on my account!!!!!!! I want my money back because if it is a “day pass” why are there additional fees I wish I could give 0 stars IM NEVER BUYING EVER AGAIN AND IM GOING TO SPREAD THE WORLD AND REPORT THIS TO EVERYONE"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/09/2018,"Citibike is my favorite part of my 4 years in NYC! I have been using Citibike for 4 years in New York City for commuting, leisure, and when family/friends visit the city. It is such a great way for me to commute to work (2 miles through midtown, ~12 minutes). It is much faster, and a much nicer way to travel through the city than by car, bus, or subway. I really enjoy using Citibike to get around the city 7 days a week, and I love getting bikes with family and friends when they visit! It truely is a great way to see the city, as well as getting ""from A to B"" efficiently. I feel that any complaints I have read in these reviews are completely unwarranted, and have been made by people who have not read the agreement or understood the rules. Yearly members have 45 minutes bike rides included, while day trip users get 30 minute rides (before incurring additional fees). These rules are made very clear before purchasing anything. There is a deposit that will be held on your credit card, similar to when you rent a hotel. This is a necessary part of the program.  The Citibike app lets you know exactly where the bike stations are, and how many bikes/stations are available to help you plan your rides in advance. I have had only one or two issues in 4 years with citibike, and have been promptly helped by Citibike staff over the phone. If the 30 minute time limit does not suit your needs, I would plan on paying overage fees, or finding alternate transportation. Citibike really isn't suited for long, leisurely trips. I see it a more of an efficient method for people to get around the city - while enjoying being outside and getting exercise. Hope this helps answer some questions people may have!"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/06/2018,"Huge RIP OFF - Better off walking 100% Rented a bike, first of all the code for the rental disappears after like 10 seconds and they dont tell you that you'll need it in the future and instead of texting you the code they text you some other useless information that you dont need. You then spend 15 minutes trying to get the code to unlock the bike that you already paid for. After that, you take the bike out (which had sticky residue on the handle bar) and you can enjoy it for about 10 minutes or so before you have to worry about finding another citibank bike location to return it in. GOD FORBID YOU ARE 7 MINUTES LATE TO RETURN IT YOU WILL GET CHARGED 35% OF THE RENTAL COST. After calling and nicely asking them to wave it, i got told to pound sand and that i am liable for all the charges. USELESS SERVICE ALL AROUND."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/03/2018,RIP OFF BIG TIME! The 30 minute time limit thing is ridiculous. You never know how much they are charging you even when you bring the bike back within 30 mins. This is another scam for tourists. I am going to fight them tooth and nail to get my money back. They over charged me $100. Crazy. Don't use these bikes or you will get ripped off!!!!
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,03/30/2018,"Citi Bike is the best thing in NY I can highly recommend Citi Bike as it is easy to use and come with an app with maps over all Bike routes in and around NY. 12,000 bikes to use all over the citi. Be street smart and change the bike every 30 min and it will cost you less an $10 a day. Love it. "
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,03/29/2018,"Cycle and scenery The bicycle rentals are easy (with a credit card) and a good way to see more in less time. Cycling through the city might be a bit tricky and dangerous if you are not confident. The route along the Hudson is a better alternative to navigating through city streets or even the very crowded central park route. Just familiarise yourself with the stations to revalidate. I did not have the app on my phone, but it would be a great help and recommended."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,03/12/2018,Be sure to load the Citibike app on your phone Used Citi-bike to get back and forth between Columbus Circle and West Village. It was breeze. Nice bike lanes on 9th and 8th Avenues. You may want to bring your own helmet. I never felt unsafe even when riding in traffic as the cars don't move that much faster than you.
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,03/06/2018,"OK ProsNo human interaction requiredEasy touchpad activationReasonably easy to useConsNo helmet providedSuper heavyGears slipping in 3rd when pedaling uphillExpensive and high charge for going over 30 min.I guess I am just used to much better, lighter, faster bikes."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,02/16/2018,Riverside  The bike rentals in NYC are a good way to travel but you are under a rental clock. Spontaneous stops are limited but a summer ride is a good thing to do in NYC. Citi bikes are maintained regular so it’s a less risk than random bike shop. Get fit. Have fun. Bike fit on vacation. 
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,02/14/2018,Ideaaal!! Perfect way to go around NY!! You do have to return to a check point every 30 min but they are everywhere :)!
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,02/13/2018,"30 minutes not long enough This is a great idea. But this issue I found was that some locations (not always tourist areas) had so few bikes. On one occasion I was nearing the 30 minute mark, so went to ""re-hire"" the bike only for a local who had the Annual Pass and therefore a ""button"" to unlock the bike take the bike from me when I was trying to re-enter my details on the machine. As there were no other bikes for hire, I then had to walk to another location to get a bike.First time I was so shocked I didn't know what to say. The second time I was prepared, I saw what was about to happen and made a scene. The guy was so shocked I ended up getting ""my"" bike.It is also very easy to go over the 30 minutes and get hit with the additional charges.As a concept it is great idea and I loved cycling in Central Park and down the side of the Hudson River. I think one hours hire would be more useful."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,02/05/2018,Please beware. Ripoff. Scam I visited ny city with my wife... we used city bike a couple of times always careful not to pass the 30 minute barrier. On my credit card the surprise was astonishing. Over 120 euros. Absolute rip-off. The worst thing is that you cant do anything about it. Never again. I absolutely recommend you keep away from this service. They will charge your card
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,02/05/2018,"Easy to get around, Great value for money! I'm a bit of a fangirl when it comes to riding bikes through new cities. What better way to explore a city than on a bike? New York citibikes will set you back just $12 (plus like $1.50 tax) for 24 hours of unlimited riding. All you have to do is download their app and buy a day pass. The app shows you where all the citibike stations are on a map and you can go to anyone you like a pick out a bike. You use a code on your phone to unlock the bike and off you go. There is one catch with the day passes. You need to dock the bike every 30 minutes or you will be charged $4 for every 15 minutes extra you spend on the bike. I guess this is done to curb cases of damaged and stolen bikes. It's not so bad to dock them every 30 minutes as there's so many citibike stations around New York. 24 hours of bike riding for $12 is a pretty great deal. I would recommend going to the west side of the island near the cruise terminals and grabbing a bike there. The bike path that runs along the West Side Highway is smooth and easy to navigate, plus the views are amazing. Ride down the West Side highway, through Battery Park and onto the Brooklyn Bridge. If at any point you get sick of riding you can always dock your bike and catch a subway to wherever you need to go. I would highly recommend using citibike while you're in NYC, like I said before the only downside is the 30 minute rides but it's okay as long as you keep an eye on the time."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,01/30/2018,"Biking NYC!! We don't have bike share where I'm from so I did need convincing from my friend who lives in NYC. Thankfully she did, because citi bike is a fun way to see the sights around Central Park and you can leave the bikes right by all the major museums. Just make sure you see the green light when you return the bike and you don't get charged extra. Not hard and more fun than car traffic and angry cab drivers. "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/31/2017,best way of transportation in NYC Perfect way for transportation in such a traffic jammed city..but watch your time to not exceed your 30 minutes ride or you can dock your bike and take another bike to open a new 30 minutes
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/19/2017,"Sweet system Rode over the Brooklyn Bridge at dawn on my first Citi Bike experience, then over to the 911 memorial. What a sweet system. I totally loved it. I suggest looking for bikes with the rotating black gear shift and not the little silver dial. Check the lights before you go. Thirty minute check in is a little tight but workable. Just a beautiful idea though. "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/27/2017,"I love Citi Bike Having been a CB member since the launch, I’ve logged more than 2000 rides, totaling 3600+ miles, which has accounted for 484 hours of exercising moderately and burning an estimated 155,000 calories. All that and it’s much less than $0.50 per ride - where can you get such a bargain? Yes, it is important to be aware of drivers - but now with so many of us out there, we have mostly taken our rightful share of the roads. It would be great to have more bike lanes that are protected by parking lanes ... but I guess de Blasio does not feel the “ownership” that Bloomberg did- so it does not seem like further expansions are to be forthcoming. Too bad, but it’s still an excellent addition to our transportation network. Hurray for Citi Bike! "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/13/2017,"THE BEST WAY TO GET AROUND NYC! Citi Bike is the fastest, safest way to get around NYC. It's the perfect way to explore if you're a new visitor the the city. I've been a member for 5 years and I love it. You can of course buy a daily pass too if you're visiting. But Honestly Citi Bike is best for when you get out of the subway and instead of walking 20 minutes to your final destination, you can bike there in 5min! It's a huge time saver. And if you're worried about safety, don't be! The bikes are designed for you to sit higher up so cars can see you better and New York has some of the best protected bike lanes in the world! oh and the Citi bike App on the App Store or Google Play store keeps you up to date with real time counts so you always know where to dock you bike!"
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/11/2017,"Visiting a friend in NYC for the week. This is my second time using Citi Bike. This is the fastest, most economical way to travel around Manhattan. I bought a 3-day pass and it was an enormous value for me. I love the convenience of picking up the bike and dropping it off very quickly then being on my way to whatever activity. The only drawback for me what's some kiosks, for some strange reason were shut down. This left me to have to go to the next kiosk in the neighborhood. The great thing is the app for the smartphone shows you where the kiosks are in your proximity and if they have a bike or a dock where I can leave the bicycle. The latest bicycle model available, allows you to adjust your speed without being limited to only the previously 3 speed increments. This allows you to take hills with ease. I bought a bike helmet at the Goodwill before I came to New York and I leave it at my friend's place for me to use. All in all I'm a very satisfied customer. I just received a $6 discount now for my next rental!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/10/2017,"Great way to get around Central Park at night Due to this being a business trip to NYC, we only had our evenings free. I wanted to visit Central Park and loved the idea of renting CitiBikes to view more of Central Park than if we were walking. The app was downloaded and we picked out our bikes after being given a code to unlock them. At first we couldn't figure out how to turn on the headlights, but then realized that the headlights and taillights turn on automatically when you start pedaling. There was an open basket up front that had an elastic band to tie things down. Yes, if you don't want to be charged more than the $12 day rate, you need to take it back to a bike station every 30 minutes. This was not an issue for us as there are stations all over the outskirts of Central Park. Fun experience that we would recommend to others. "
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/31/2017,"HUGE LETDOWN, charged for their mistakes LOVE the concept of a bike sharing program, but was VERY disappointed with citibike and their customer service. I was charged $164 because the sensor on the bike rack did not register that the bike had been returned. When I contacted customer service to find out where the charge came from they told me they could only refund me $60 of the $164 charge, even though the mistake was due to a faulty sensor/locking system on their bike racks. To make matters worse I rented three bikes that day for a 24 hr period, we were only able to use the three bikes for one trip. As we tried to unlock the bikes for a second trip, it only gave us one access code for one bike, so we paid for three bikes but only received one. VERY disappointing, not just that we werent able to use the bikes the full period we paid for but that citibike was unwilling to work with me to fix their mistake."
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/28/2017,"Not for tourists. Overpriced! I'm an avid bike rider and commute to work daily. Citibike advertises itself as a great opportunity for tourists but that's a joke. My daughter and I paid $12 each for a daypass - unlimited 30 minute rides. But the distances you can actually GO in 30 minutes are fleeting. 2 of 3 rides ended up being over the limit. One was 33 and one was 32 minutes. For that extra 5 minutes, we were charged $8.71 each. (They stuck tax on the $4 overage each time.)"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/28/2017,"Citibiking From Harlem to Brooklyn  For just $12, saw a lot of great sites in NYC! Started at Harlem 125th docking station, made way to Central Park. Plenty of docking stations to return bike every 30 minutes so as to not incur additional fees. NYC is really bike-friendly with plenty of designated lanes, just use your Citibike app to see where the lanes are. After hiking around the Park, ended up taking subway to City Hall and then grabbed Citibikes for a trip over the pedestrian-congested Brooklyn bridge...use your bell to clear the way! Then rode around picturesque Brooklyn neighborhoods that were all decked out for Halloween, along waterfront for amazing views of lower Manhattan, then into the cobblestone streets under the Brooklyn bridge. After footing around there, got a Citibike and headed back over the bridge. Highly recommend using Citibike if you’re looking for a fun, new, inexpensive way to see the city! Make sure you have the app and be diligent about watching your time and having an idea of where you want to go so you don’t incur those extra fees after 30 minutes! Happy Citibiking!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/28/2017,Excellent well managed system I come from London and we have a similar system that I do use relatively frequently. First time using citibike and found it an excellent service. Plan your trips. Nyc is easy to navigate and you can get quite a distance in 20-25 mins Leaving plenty of time to find your dock and walk to the next station if you need to travel further. 
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/25/2017,"EXPENSIVE HOUR BIKE RIDE... 30 MIN RIDE..DOCK IT IF AVAILABLE SO YOU WONT BE CHARGED! Please read the fine print and understanding on the citibike, If you are renting for the first time. You are only ALLOWED 30 MINUTES at $12.00 plus tax to ride the bike, after 30 mins you MUST dock the bike and pick up another bike, If you KEEP the bike longer than 30 MINUTES , you will be AUTOMATICALLY charged $4 per every 15 minutes over! Paying $26.00 FOR AN HOUR BIKE RIDE IS A RIP OFF! NEVER AGAIN. "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/17/2017,"Learn how to use and ENJOY my friend and I spent 6 days using citibikes in September. Like so may say, it was a major highlight of our trip. We did two 3 day passes and purchased the $5 keys so we didnt have to use codes. It's true you can only ride in 30 minute segments but we planned trips and the bikes are EVERYWHERE. Only a few of our trips took two segments. Whenever possible take the westside bikepath along the river. It is very fun and QUICK. Granted we had great weather but we plan to take Citibike whenever we are in NYC again. It was fun and saved us a TON of money. We were in midtown and could go downtown in about 11 minutes. People who complain here did not bother to LEARN how to use the system. Downloading the app and reading beforehand helps a lot. If you are uncertain, try for 24 hours. You will never have more fun in NYC for $12. TRY IT."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/12/2017,Used Citi Bike to follow someone on 18 mike run Very inconvenient. Needed to find docking stations every 30 min and then had to wait 2 minutes to take another one out. Final charge was $30.44 for 3 hours...missed 2 docking stations by 3 minutes and the last docking station by 20 minutes because the station in central park was closed due to an event going on.Do not take out if you are going longer than 30 min!!!
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/04/2017,"Crooks What a racket. They charged me an extra 17 bucks so I could do tem a favor and take the bike to an empty location went the place I went to take it back was full and so was the next one. Ended up paying the price of an unlimited metrocard 7 day pass for 2 45 minute bike rides. Not worth it. No text about it being late, nothing. Greedy. Should have know by something run by Citi bank, they make all their money on late fees just like a bank."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/03/2017,"WORST WASTE OF MONEY The Bikes are super heavy. If you're below 5'2 you will barely reach the floor even with the seat all the way down. You have to worry about docking it every 30 minutes.

What a waste of money. Do Not get!"
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/01/2017,"Just don't us it more than 30mins at a time While it appears great value @ $12/24 hrs, it's unlimited 30 min trips, not continuous use for 24 hrs - got a nasty surprise on my credit card arriving home ($87) after using it for 1 1/2 hours on Governors Island, now I know why nobody else was using them. When contacted, they agreed to halve the charge. More suited to locals going point A to B, not tourists ambling around for a few hours. Signage could be a bit clearer on this"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/01/2017,Great trip Easy and efficient service great way to experience New York. Had a wonderful time exploring and would highly recommend it to anyone travelling to New York
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/30/2017,"Made our experince of New York Best thing to do in New York, after a while, you feel like a local. The bike paths were really planned out especially along water/ pier areas.A couple of scary moments in the heart of the City - from city walkers, not cars.Caught a few celebrities riding Citi Bikes - Leonardo.Doing this activity was the highlight of the New York experience."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/24/2017,"Great experience Had. Few hours to spare after a business trip, so staying in Queens I booked a $12 day pass and had a great time cycling over Queensboro bridge, around Central Park, went to the Met, Mid town etc. Really handy and easy to use. Great way to see New York. Impressed with how many Citibike stations there are and the bike lanes. Go for it."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/21/2017,"The best way to get around Brooklyn I have hired similar bikes to this in London so was looking forward to trying it in New York. We had done an organised tour in Manhattan the day before to get our cycle legs and negotiate the extra busy tricky areas. We were staying in Brooklyn and used the bikes to tour Brooklyn, down the Hudson River and to Williamsburg and Greenpoint. The bikes were very simple to use, gears changed easily and were in good condition. There were always bike docking stations within 30 minutes of each one so we had no problem finding a suitable one. Make sure that you know roughly where they are but if you stick to cycle routes there seemed to always be stations. You have to wait 2 minutes between each docking however this gives you time to have a drink and check the next location. On one occasion there were no free docking stands but a quick cycle to the next soon solved that problem. I know some people bemoan this fact but I paid £14 for 24 hours for 2 bikes, travelled miles, visited areas I would not have got the subway to and had a great day. It is nice to be able to dock your bike and leave with no responsibility for it - time for a quick coffee and then back to a new bike. The routes we used were always busy with people and bike certainly seemed to have right of way where we were. I would hire one of these every time I go!"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/20/2017,"Horrendous customer service, docking machines not working and spurious charges made In theory this is a good way of getting around the city. IN practice, absolutely terrible. We hired 3 bikes on a Saturday and then all the machines where you need to re-dock every 30 minutes all went down. We wasted time trailing to 5 different machines and eventually gave up. When contacting customer service on return to the UK, they are absolutely appalling; ranging from not replying, then replying requesting the same information on numerous occasions and then failing to find our account or any accurate information about our spend. Ended up reporting them to the fraud dept of our credit card company for not refunding but worse still, for adding many spurious costs - don't touch with a barge pole"
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/19/2017,"Watch the fees over 30 minutes of uses We rented Citi Bikes while in New York. The fee structure is not well explained at the kiosk. We thought we were paying $12 for a ""day pass."" What is not clear is that it is $12 for a day of 30 minute rides. This is nuts. You need to ride from kiosk to kiosk to return the bike so you can ride for another 30 minutes? I was surprised to see a charge for another $117.50 for usage fees when I got my credit card bill today. Deceptive advertising in my opinion. Beware."
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/18/2017,"Good choice, few seasons to leave the bice every 30 min The cycling experience in New York is great. Unfortunately we rented the bike one day and as there were no nearby stations (with free parking places), the half hour ride was impossible, we paid more for late penalties than for the whole day of service. Brooklyn is a bad idea Citi Bike in Manhattan is better, but the risk is that you arrive at crowded stations and you can not leave the bike and end up paying $ 4, $ 8, $ 12 penalty. Half an hour each time is a very bad idea, would be better 45 minutes, so give time to track stations with free places to leave the bike without suffering what I and my friends live.La experiencia ciclista en Nueva York es estupenda. Desafortunadamente alquilamos la bici un día y como no había estaciones cercanas (con lugares para estacionar libres), el recorrido de media hora era imposible, pagamos más por penalizaciones por demora que por todo el día de servicio. En Brooklyn es una pésima idea la Citi Bike, en Manhattan es mejor, pero el riesgo es que llegas a estaciones llenas y no puedes dejar la bici y terminas pagando $4, $8, $12 de penalización. Media hora cada vez es una muy mala idea, serían mejores 45 minutos, así da tiempo de rastrear estaciones con lugares libres para dejar la bici sin padecer lo que yo y mis amigas vivimos."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/10/2017,Very nice Absolutly great ... spend the $5 for the bike key wwweeeellll worth it .i only wish the whole dock the bike every thirty minutes would stop... annoying
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/05/2017,So convenient and economical Alfonzo was such a help.  He signed us in and make sure we didn't choose the option where you had to return the bike every 30 minutes.  It worked out great.  The only downside was those hills on the north side of Central Park. LOL!
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/03/2017,"Ride=Awesome/Rental=Caution One of the greatest ideas for getting around the city ever. Healthy, highly available and will kept bikes in an increasingly bike friendly city.That being said cautions include1 bring your own helmet 2 bikes don't always dock so you are charged overage if you don't dock properly. 3 watch your time it's$4 for every 15m over your allotted 30m segment. I accidentally didn't dock it fully and the bike was missing for 24hrs. CitiBike had a great call center and when the bike was returned I was credited the overage of$139.Get the bikes because they are awesome just be aware and follow the rules."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/30/2017,Citibike Service Big shout out to Tammy Evans of Citibike who runs the valet docking station at the Plaza Hotel location on 56th and 5th. I'm an annual member and she goes out of her way to help and make sure that the valet station there runs properly. She also walked over a replacement card to my office one day when the old card stopped working. Other valet stations sometimes get full and they don't indicate it on the app but Tammy always make sure they can take your bike there (to avoid the stress of not being able to find a station) so you don't get stuck.
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,08/28/2017,"Don't get overcharged!  Apparently there is some small print on the side of the Day Pass terms that you get charged extra if you keep it for more than 30 min at a time. I ended up being charged $26 because I kept the bike for an hour! How dumb is that to have to check-in/check-out a bike every 30 min just to avoid extra fees on a DAY PASS. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has been confused by this, they should make the Day Pass terms more clear. Besides all of that, the bike was a convenient way to bike around Central Park. "
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,08/24/2017,Central Park We hired bikes from Citi bikes but you have to check in every 30 minutes or you get charged.. so you have to look for a check in area every 20/25 minutes and they are located off Central Park.. which ruined it for us...too much of a tie...wouldn't recommend 
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/24/2017,"Can be GREAT....Here's LOCAL advice before you choose this option I've been using Citibike since it first started and am a long time NYer. Citi Bike NYC is not for everyone. Some of it is Citi Bike's fault. Some of it is New York's fault. Below is a guide to help you decide if it's right for you.1) 30MIN LIMIT (under 1 year pass)/45MIN LIMIT (annual Pass). The Bike is really cheap, except if you hold it for more than 30 minutes. This is great if you are using Citibike as an alternative form of transport from the subway. Less great if you are hoping for a long bike ride through the city. 2) DON'T USE CITIBIKE FOR THESE ATTRACTIONS: Central park riders will think Citibike is a comparable option to bicycle renters that dot the area. In some ways it is, because the rental companies often charge $30 for 4 hours and you won't likely need the bike the full 4 hours. Central Park is a 6.1mile/10km loop provided you know where you're going. This is a 3 speed, heavy leisure bike. It's actually quite aggressive to try to get around all of Central park in 30 minutes. You can likely find a citibike, get around 2/3rds of it, find a docking kiosk depending on how you plan. A little aggressive, but possible. There aren't Citibike Kiosks yet in Central Park, so you'll be biking in and out, i.e. traffic lights. West Side Highway is a better bet, but watch the clock. Due to weight, traffic lights, and limitations of the bike, I think from 60th Street to Chinatown is the most I can do in 30minutes (about 3.5-4 miles) including undocking/redocking the bike. But I am a marathon runner, who trains regularly for competitions and I know where I'm going and where the kiosks are.3) NO HELMET vs. HELMET. NYers are notoriously bad for using no helmet. At the current moment, you will not get ticketed for failing to use one. 4) BIKE LANES & TRAFFIC RULES. Sometimes you have to ignore them if you don't plan on dying. The US Is behind European Countries for bicycling. The way cars and pedestrians behave, it's more like China, circa 1990 or the Emerging countries of Asia. You have to stay alert. That makes it wild and fun for some, but scares the pants off of others.5) THICK SKIN FOR PEOPLE YELLING AT YOU. NYers are yellers. Cabs, pedestrians, and other bikers will often all exercise their freedom of speech to strongly in their communicate their opinion of one's biking skills. You want to have a humorous attitude toward this and see it as part of the show. 6) BEST AND WORST HOURS. If you're still not deterred, realize that rush hour is the scariest time and early morning (before 7am) is the most serene time. 7) AVOID TIMES SQUARE AND HERALDS SQUARE UNLESS THAT IS YOUR DESTINATION. Even the cars avoid these areas. If you bike in these areas, your issue is pedestrians and they are extremely clueless (sorry... I love you visitors, but you guys tend to be looking up at the buildings, walking in zig zags and at odd angles across the street and it's hard to know what to do on bicycle behind you).8) DOWNLOAD 2 APPS TO HELP YOU. Citibikenyc will tell you in advance whether you're going to a kiosk station with no bikes. This will save you from getting there and burning minutes trying to find an open Kiosk. If there are only 1 or 2 slots, I would not chance it. Citymapper will tell you how long it will take an average cyclist on a heavy citibike can get there. Even if you are a competitive biker, realize pedestrians, construction, and more can get in your way. Until you get a good sense for your timing relative to Citymappers estimates in bicycling, trust Citymapper. 9) DO NOT BICYCLE ON SIDEWALKS. It's way better to bike against traffic than it is to ride on a sidewalk. Pedestrians are more dangerous than cars in this city and you are in the wrong if you hit them vs. a car which will always end up with the ticket. 10) EASIEST CITIBIKE ROUTES. If you just want to check this out and need a path that won't incur overages, get the 24 hour card. Ride along West Side Highway (WSH) doing all the attractions along the Hudson River in order. WSH is by far the safest route, as there are no cars, just pedestrians and other crazy bikers for most of it. Also, you can get a bike at Cityhall or Chinatown and go over to Brooklyn Bridge (preferably before 10am). Park your bike in Brooklyn and check out the water front. Then Ride back on the Manhattan Bridge. Each bridge is 1 very hilly mile. The Manhattan Bridge is slightly less steep and a lot less crowded. If after 10am, walk over the Brooklyn Bridge. May not be as fun to ride it."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/24/2017,"Understand the rules, and you will love Citi Bike. I saw that almost all the one star reviews had the same complaint. They did not know of the 1/2 hour limit per ride, and they did not know about the credit card hold. In all fairness, this can be a major problem for those that do not know about it. Frankly, a tourist would likely be better off with a rental from a private rental company where they can have the terms clearly explained to them. However, if you live or work in NYC, there is no better bike option. All bikes are in good to great condition, and they do exactly what they are designed to do - give you access to a bike for a short commute within the city. Having the App is essential since it is the only way to know where the bikes are, and where you can dock them when you are done. I found customer service to be completely professional whenever I call and I have no complaints. The Citi Bike has saved me thousands of dollars in the years that I have been using it, and given me hundreds of hours of pleasure! Know the rules before you go, have the app on your smartphone and enjoy!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/24/2017,"Citi Bike lets you feel the city like no other. I lived in NYC in the 70s and thought I knew it. Citi Bike has opened a new city to me. If you're visiting and are thinking about Citi Bike I urge you to try it. Be careful but don't be afraid. It's the greatest way to get around and to see New York. Check the pricing on the passes, I come to NY often enough that I have an annual pass so I don't have to worry about it, but reading the other reviews, I can see that some people got surprised b/c they bought the wrong pass (the ""day pass"" sounds like you're renting a bike for the day but you're not!),"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/16/2017,"A great way to get around NYC I am a confident commuter cyclist but was very leery of riding in NYC. After passing up several chances in the past, on a free efternoon i bit the bullet and rented a citibike hoping to have time to take in more of NYC tha i vpuld manage on foot. What a great choice. Renting the bike with a credit card was straightforward. I rode up to Central park and turned the bike in, you can't keep the same bike for over 30 min w/o incurring a surcharge. After looking at the statues, i checked out another bike (no new charge, the rental is good for 24 hrs.) And had the most pleasant ride around the park. Again i checked in the bike on cental park west. After scoping out a marked path to the Hudson River greenway, i checked out another bike and headed south, a pleasant ride on a multi use pathway. I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable and functional the 3-speed bikes were. The seats are easily adjutable to approximate a fit. There are no significant hills that require a lower gear. I will certainly plan to use Citibike as an alternative transportation when returning to NY."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/14/2017,"We LOVE Citi Bike. Don't make the mistake the bad reviews made and you'll have a blast!! We were in NYC to see a concert this week (August 10, 2017). We were near Central Park and decided to rent a Citi Bike. We made the same mistake the people in the bad reviews did, and I understand why they're unhappy. Pick the wrong rental plan and you'll be charged a small fortune. Citi offers a 'Day Pass' and an hourly pass. The Day Pass is not what it sounds like. It is meant for frequent short (30 minute or less) trips throughout the day. It's meant for locals running errands, shoppers, commuters, etc. Keep the bike for longer than 30 minutes and they charge you $4 every 15 minutes. The Day Pass is not what you want when you're on vacation, even though it sounds like it is. We made this mistake since I never read the fine print (which isn't easy on a smart phone, but...). The hourly pass charges $4 an hour, and the clock stops running when you check the bike back into a rack. When you want to ride again you pick up another bike anywhere and the meter starts running again. It's set up so you can shop, have lunch or just relax and only be charged for your actual riding time.Once we figured out that we had the wrong plan (my wife does read the fine print ;-), we went to the Citi kiosk at the south end of Central Park, where we met Tammy, a Citi Bike representative. She was awesome!! She explained the different passes, and told us why the hourly pass was what we needed. She called customer service and got our day pass refunded (minus a charge for the overtime we had run up) and got us set up with the hourly pass. She also told us a lot of great places to ride, gave us a map of the city and the Citi Bike locations, and told us about the NYC CitiStreets festival scheduled for the next day. We wound up staying overnight, renting a bike the next morning and riding down Park Ave (closed to traffic that day) and over the Brooklyn Bridge. Tammy helped me have on of my best birthdays ever- my wife and I can't say enough good things about her. She rocks, and she made us Citibike fans forever."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/08/2017,"Don't rent bikes!!  DO NOT RENT: Very very disappointed in this service. They put hold of $104 on what ever card you use. I rented 2 bikes so that was basically $210 from my account that was frozen. This caused a HUGE problem since I have a daily limit, which doesn't work so good when I'm on vacation in NY. The deposit info isn't listed clearly on the rental stand. Once customer service was notified, they said we needed to read the waiver all 50 pages of it, despite a line of 5 people behind my group. The first CSR hung up on me after asking to speak to a manager. The 2nd CSR was so rude! I recommend renting a bike from 1 of the other vendors. The worst part of my vacation. NY was an incredible vacation for me and my friends. Sadly, this caused all 6 of us stress! "
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/07/2017,"Got charged ~100$ overtime fees on a daily pass!!!! :( I got a Citibike on Sunday. Since this was my first time ever using one, I called a customer care from bike stand. I mentioned to her that I have never used this service before and was in a rush. I asked her about the plans they offer and if I can take the bike on hourly basis. She mentioned that they only have 1 day, 3 days, monthly and annual plans. Since I needed the bike only for few hours, I went with a daily pass. The customer care representative asked me to spot a kiosk nearby to complete the transaction. What she ignored telling me is that the bike needs to be docked every 30 minutes to a bike stand to avoid a late fee. On returning the bike, I saw a humungous charge on my credit card of 100+. On calling customer care multiple times, every time I was told curtly that 'you need to plan your trip accordingly, '12$ is for system use', 'there is nothing we can do' etc. They adjusted the charge nominally on requesting a first-time courtesy but did not do it completely.This bike service is a complete scam and rip off. The customer agents are rude and this company is in business of making money based on customer's ignorance. With the amount of money they charged me, I could have bought an actual bike and used it forever! I want to question the rationale for this policy. If this is for bike sharing, the customers should be charged overtime only when the bikes there are less bikes available at the stand (similar to demand based pricing of Uber). The whole bike stand where I took the bike from was full! It pains to know that a large bank like Citi is sponsoring such an unethical company bike company! It seems both are not able to earn money by fair and regular business and adopting to such practices. Are consumer agencies listening to customer's plights and can this unfair policy be changed?Why am I being subject to something I was not aware of? Something that the customer care did not care to explain to me completely? I could have opted not to ride the bike that day. How does the charge of $ 100+ plus taxes justify using the bike for few hours in addition to paying a daily rate of $12 plus taxes and being liable for 1200$ for a lost or stolen bike? The company needs to train the customer service agents to give complete information and change the unfair overtime fees policy.I am simply not prepared and ‘cannot afford’ to pay 112$ as a bike rental for a day. I am sure others like you value your hard-earned money as well."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/04/2017,"Appalling customer service My advice is 'don't do it'. Hire bikes for half a day rather than being ripped off by this lot. Hidden conditions, expensive fines and poor quality equipment is just the beginning of it. I raised my concerns over the course of four or five emails and they refuse to reply to them. Pathetic! Be careful people!!!!!"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/01/2017,"I got ripped off by Citi.  Do we have any lawyers out there that will take a class action? Citi once again has a hidden message in all the mumbo jumbo consent agreement where they can charge additional prices.  They mislead you to think you can rent and ride for 24 hours, but you can't."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/31/2017,"24 Hour pass My husband and I rented these on our second day in NYC. The first day we rented from a different company and rode through the park, not even realizing that citi bike was an option. We purchased the 24 pass which was around $10 per person. We then rode from Times Square all the way to Pier A and back.Downside is that you can only have the bikes out to 1/2 hour at a time. Since we were going a long distance, we had to make an effort to stop 30 mins in and find a station. Which was fine, except for the times that we came to a station that didn't have any openings to dock the bikes.Overall, it was a good experience and I would do it again. Just make sure you are reading the fine print and know all the details before you buy."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/30/2017,"Citi bikes were a great option We have been to NY many times but this was the first time we used the bikes. It really worked well for us when we wanted to cover a lot of ground relatively quickly. Also just pleasant in and of itself, especially when you stick to designated paths. The day pass made the whole experience both impulsive and leisurely. A real hop on and hop off experience. Though do be sure to dock within 30 minutes each time. But with docking stations seemingly everywhere they are easy to find, especially if you have a smartphone. The main caution is to check your bike before you pull it out of the dock. Most bikes were ok but check the tires, the bell (bell is quite important, you will use it as you are in either vehicle or pedestrian traffic all the time), the gear shift. I had a couple of duds before I wised up. Go for it!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/26/2017,"Hourly pass in action Citi Bike is by far the best way to get around this concrete jungle, especially now that there's an hourly pass. This is perhaps the best kept secret in all of New York City. It's just $6 an hour, as many hours as you like, no overage. It's really top notch, and I must take my helmet off to Citi Bike for being so responsive to the needs of their customers.If I could pick 3 things to do on a visit to NYC, they'd be #1, bike around using a Citi Bike; #2 go to the Gibson in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and enjoy their namesake cocktail, the Tecate; and #3 eat pizza all the time."
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/24/2017,"Only good for 30 minute intervals As a family we wanted to jump on a bike and ride a quick loop around Central Park. The bikes are located right at the Central Park South Entrance. Pop in your credit card- (never use a debit for rentals) and off you go. We thought we could make one loop around the park but with other bikers, walkers, skaters, poor signage we were only able to make it a little over half way before we noticed another citi bike rack. We popped our bikes back in and planned on taking them back out for another 30 minutes. The problem is the person with the original credit card was ahead of us on the path so we couldn't obtain a new code to unlock the bikes again. We ended up walking the rest of the park that day which was fine since the park is so beautiful. Renting from private companies at the park entrance is expensive but worth it if you plan on riding the whole day. "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/24/2017,"CitiBike is a great way to explore the city CitiBike has done a great thing and added an hourly pass! 6 bucks an hour, no security deposit or overages... A really nice addition to their other options especially for tourists or out of towners looking to explore the city. I used to live in New York so an annual pass made sense, but as a visitor from the West Coast now it's nice to have these other options."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/24/2017,"New hourly passes are an amazing way to explore the city! I just had an amazing weekend exploring and cruising around NYC on a CitiBike. I rented the bike in the Central Park area, rode down to SoHo past all kinds of cool shops, and then travelled all the way over the bridge to Williamsburg! It took a while, sure, but that wasn't really a problem with the hourly pass. It was $6 bucks an hour and automatically charged me the correct amount when I was done. Riding over the Williamsburg bridge was AMAZING! Oh my goodness those views.Highly recommend CitiBike (and the hourly pass if you feel like traveling without a schedule) for doing some serious exploring of NYC."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/24/2017,"awesome hourly bike rental you can rent these for $6 an hour which is awesome for those of us, local or not, that don't have a membership. yay citibike"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/24/2017,hourly pass is $$$ Citibike released an hourly pass. exactly what i needed.  nice to have more than 30 minutes now before needing to doc a bike!
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/24/2017,"Life changing! I love Citi bike and have been using it to commute from work to my daughter's daycare pretty much everyday. I used to use the hourly pass but I use the bikes so much that I recently got an annual membership. I'm not sure what the other reviews are talking about regarding the trip duration. You can buy the hourly pass for $6/hour and use it for as long as you want. I always recommend friends who are visiting the city to explore using a citi bike. Tourists- trust me, there's no scam, you just have to select hourly pass! I love that I can get a workout, save money and do something good for the environment. The app is also so helpful bc you can look at the dock nearest you and see how many bikes are available. I wish every city had citibike!!"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/18/2017,"SCAM!!! First of all if you are a tourist - use your credit card because on page 2 out of 50 is a tiny print preauthorization agreement that you agree to a $110 fee for 48 hours on your card. We used debit and have a limit on our card each day and it halted the use of my card. There are 6 in our group and each was charged that amount. So, Citi used our money for 48 hours totaling $660 for our group). ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! Then when we tried calling to get it off the customer service department was extremely rude (guessing they deal with lots of these calls) and hung up on us. To top it off we downloaded the app to make sure we didn't exceed the 30 min - and didn't matter because we did anyway. We started at the base of the Brooklyn bridge and ended across it in Brooklyn and we exceeded the 30 minutes. (if they know it is going to exceed it to cross, Citi should put a station on the top of the bridge). Along with it being shady, you have 24 hour access to the bikes, but have to dock them every 30 minutes. FINALLY to top it off, my bike was broke and would only go in third gear. If anyone goes in third gear uphill, it was virtually impossible!!!!! Dont waste your money and go with a local bike company!!!!!!!!!!"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/12/2017,"Total Scam for Tourist - beware of late fines after 30 minutes! I see others experienced the same problem we had. I have rented bikes all over the world and I speak English! I saw the $12/day on the sign and said great. We biked from the top of central park to the Plaza where we saw some citibike employees. I wanted to ask them for directions and this guy said did you check your bike in? I said I just got my bike. He said you have to turn it in every 30 minutes and I said I rented it for the day. He said you have to check it in, I said that made no sense but went with him to check 3 bikes in only to see we were fined already $24! I was furious and told him I had never had such a thing happen with bike rental. HE THEN SAID WE ARE NOT A BIKE RENTAL! Oh ok - then what the heck are you? I said I am sure other tourists have the same problem and he said that is why they were there. He did not apologize or feel bad. I wrote citibike and got the same response about returning every 30 minutes. The concept is good but the random 30 minute time limit makes no sense. We saw locals even check their bikes in, sit on them for 2 minutes and then go again. As for the bikes themselves, most were in okay shape but if you are a tourist do you research and get a better bike that comes with a lock and let's you use as you wish."
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/11/2017,"30 minutes is way too short We had an enjoyable experience on these bikes, however we found that the 30 minute deadline to dock your bike is far too short. They are a great way to explore a city, but after about 20 minutes, you're searching for the next station, which really impacted our experience. We met a couple that were unaware of this deadline, and had been riding for several hours. I have rented bikes in Paris and other cities in Europe before, no time limit, they work great. NYC needs to reconsider this 30 minute thing. Otherwise, the bikes were durable and solid and although we changed at 10 stations during the day, there was only one station that was full. It was an excellent alternative to walking for sure!"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/07/2017,"NOT For Tourists I rented the bike because it told me that I had access for 24 hours. I rented it near Queensboro Bridge, so I assumed the bikes were there to travel and explore Queens. Long distance travel and enjoyment is what bikes are designed for. 5 hours later I found out from someone that I was supposed to return it within 30 minutes, which would never had occurred to me, because that totally defeats the purpose of renting a bike. This is just a way to scam ignorant tourists like myself. The bikes are for commuting to and from work, but not for tourists. They charged me $86. Even if I knew about the 30 minutes, it would be very difficult to impossible to try to rush around finding the next docking station, and not at all enjoyable. In 3rd gear, the bike will not even go that fast. All they would have to do is provide a pay by hour option, but instead they prefer to scam tourists. I could have rented by the hour and rented a much faster and enjoyable bike for less from another rental company."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/06/2017,Citi bike is awesome Bike are very sturdy and dependable.  Great staff at the Valet stations too.  Ayianna and Tammy are the best!  Very helpful and super friendly!!
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/04/2017,"Tourist Trap We paid $105 for five bikes to cruise around Central Park for ninety minutes. Absolutely ridiculous! The fees seem reasonable—$12/bike for 30 minutes—but having to dock the bike every 30 minutes to avoid additional charges is inconvenient especially for tourists who have no idea where the bike stations are located (there are none in the park). Also, I was supposed to receive a text alert when I was nearing the 30-minute limit but never did. Surprisingly, they texted me when I docked the bikes. What a scam!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/03/2017,"Perfect for short trips in addition to using public transit A lot of reviews seem to be upset about the 30-45 minute limit on ""free"" trips (when you buy a pass), but that's all stated upfront. If you want to bike around the whole day, or even a couple of hours non-stop, this isn't it. However, if you want to use the bike for 10-30 minute trips between destinations, this is much faster than walking and often faster than taking the bus. Just look up where to drop it off - they have docking stations every few blocks."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/25/2017,"So much fun! We were having difficulty with the 30 min check in and Tammy Evans, the valet, was super helpful!! We were able to bike a full lap around Central Park without too much difficulty! Super thankful for Tammy for making our trip so awesome!"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/24/2017,"Feels like a SCAM WORST bike rental service I've ever used. I wish I could give me 0 to negative stars. If you don't want to have any overcharges given to you days after you even used a bike, DO NOT use this service. I did not even know about the 30min docking bike rule until I saw I was overcharged days later. It took us more than 20mins to even find another docking location, also not being from NYC worked against us. This ridiculous system seems to have been purposely created to scam people and force them to pay the fees. Day pass was $13 and for just riding over and hour without docking, we paid a total of $30+ each. Customer service is just as useless."
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/18/2017,"EXPENSIVE PEDAL My wife and I were on a 4 night stay in New York City and covered as many highlights as possible. I'm a keen cyclist and so we looked at quick cycling options for a half day or so. I weighed up various companies inc Citi Bike which have numerous stations around the city and tourist areas. This seemed a convenient option offering freedom to pick up and deposit wherever.As I realise now it was an expensive option. Stations advertise a bike hire at $12 dollars per day. Sounds good? So I thought. The next half hour is included in the initial charge of $12 then it gets expensive. Let's face it, if your hiring a bike then 30 minutes is nothing if your stopping here and there to take on views, photos etc.Thereafter the rates jump to $4 per 15 minutes X say two bikes, it becomes a pretty expensive hire.On hindsight, I'd go for another option/company like Blazing Saddles even though it reduces hire and return options it'll work out infinitely cheaper plus provision of that all important cycle helmet."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/16/2017,"What a Rip Off! The sign when I rented my bike inferred I could borrow it for up to 24 hours hours for a flat $12 fee. That seemed pricey, given I only wanted to go a hour or so and other bike sharing systems cost $5 for the hour, but I went for it. What a mistake! Not only was I charged the $12 fee, but I was charged an additional $33 for using the bike for almost 2 hours (I was enjoying the ride). $45 expense. Never again."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/15/2017,"Don't use Citi Bike when you can ride a bike The most stupid system where you can bike for 20 minutes, look for a dockingstation to avoid a penalty. No service in the weekend, almost no serivice during the week.At the end of the day I had to pay over $ 200.- because I turned the bike in too late, I used it all day (according to them but why the previous penalties?) often empty dockingstations. Without wifi not doable to find a dockingstation.I wish I had this idea to earn money this easy.Conclusion: buying a bike is cheaper or rent one for one day without this stupid 30 minutes rule. Plenty to find"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/14/2017,Citi bike is an expensive way of cycling in NYC When you buy a day pass you still have to return your bike every 30 min. which is rediculous ! A day pass should provide access for the whole day not 30 min. This limitation was not obvious so cycling with 2 bikes in NYC for 6 hours was very expensive !! The Citi bike system is misleading & very costly.Go to a regular bike shop if you want to rent a bike in NYC !!!
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/31/2017,"Convenient service. Maybe better for residents than tourists. I got a day pass and used it from about noon to 11 at night. I was able to find bike stations all over Manhattan and in Downtown Brooklyn, which made it really convenient. The downsides are: the text messages could be more helpful, like telling you when your bikes were checked out instead of when they were docked, the bikes are good but not great, and sometimes you really want to ride from the financial district to the AMNH, but that's too far for the 30 minute time limit. Definitely would recommend and would reuse on future visits."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/28/2017,"One of the best biking experiences ever I have travelled to many cities with bike sharing scheme, but this was the best. The quality of the bikes, availability ...Only the 30 min limitation seems a bit stringent because the city is big... and if you don't have the app, it is not so efficient. Anyway, please do it !(I didn't have a bike even)! But the streets are increasingly safer and drivers were very kind."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/24/2017,"Good system, undeserved bad flack Great system specially to move around in New York (Brooklyn even more so). I used it to take a long ride in Central Park and it was really nice, although because of the 30 min limit I'd recommend a bike rental (walk around the park and you'll see lots of guys holding 'bike rental' signs). It wasn't super stressful, but I had to keep track of time constantly so I wouldn't exceed the 30 min limit and pay extra (you pay $12 for 24h and $24 for 72 hours). After you dock it, you must wait 2 min in order to be able to pick another one up, which is reasonable, imo.I saw someone criticize that they charged her for not docking her bike properly, and I think she can't complain - I mean, it's not rocket science, you just check that a green light comes up and confirms the correct docking. Otherwise anyone can come and just take the bike away. Someone else said they couldn't find a bike in one of the docking stations. That happens everywhere in any city that has such a system. The app shows you which stations have more units available, so it's​ not really that difficult to plan ahead."
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,05/21/2017,"Good intentions We bought a one day pass to bike around NYC, there is definitely some good intentions with this idea, but also some annoying issues like, the app not always working, preventing you from getting a bike, only 30 min ride unless you want to pay additional 4$/15 min which is a bit stressful as you always needs to plan the drop off and keep track of the clock. Errors with the bikes and the docks also caused some issues, as if you take out a bike and find out it is broken, you can place it back in the dock but are not allowed to take another bike until you have waited some minutes 3-5, even though you marked it as defect. To improve they should work on the app to solve the instability, to allow one to immediately pull a new bike if it is broken, and allow for more than 30 min ride and or lower the prize for riding outside the included 30 min.If we were to do this again, I would recommend to rent a bike another place where you have it a full day with a lock so you can bike around in your own tempo."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/16/2017,Horrible ! It was my first time to use Citi bike and it was horrible. I rent two bikes one for me and other for my husband. We took the bike around and wanted to return. Of course they location where we got it from did not have any space so we had to ride farther away. We docked the bike went home. We leave pretty far away like every one knows there is no citi bike up town. We got home and I got messages that I get extra charged for time. I decide to give them a call. They told me one of the bikes is not docked in. I was confused case there was one code to take the bikes and there have to be TWO messages when you dock the bike. The costumer service told me to go back and dock the bike. I have young kids and I was not able to go back. Apparently they can not do anything to help you with just have extra charges.SO PLEASE WHEN YOU EVER TAKE CITI BIKE READ ALL THE RULES EVEN THERE IS LINE OF PEOPLE WHO GETS UPSET WHEN YOH TAKE LONG TIME. Just do it will save you lot of money !!!' Never again 
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/13/2017,"Best Experience in NYC If you haven't been on a bike in a big city, this seems like a scary thing to do. It's actually amazingly tranquil. Traffic in NYC moves at 5-15 MPH, making bikes the fastest way to get around and neutralizing the danger of fast moving vehicles. "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/13/2017,"Fantastic way to get around the city I love using Citi bike to get around NYC. I've lived here for two years and the coverage has become amazing. During peak rush hour, it can be a little tough to find a bike at a dock, but usually I never have issues with Citi Bike. Definitely a great way for tourists to get around the city too."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/10/2017,"Best Way to See NYC!!! My husband and I just got back from a 4-day weekend in NYC. It was our first time there and other than a list of some things we wanted to see, we had absolutely no plans. As soon as we got into Manhattan, my husband spotted these bike racks and after looking into it a bit, we signed up for the 3-day pass for 2 bikes ($48+ tax). My husband is NOT a city guy, but he just keeps talking about how awesome it was having the bikes. We ended up seeing more attractions than we had ever planned partly because it was so easy to get around and partly because as we were biking, we came across places we wouldn't have even thought of! The only downfall of the entire thing was that you could only have a bike for a max of 30 minutes, which in reality makes sense, it was just a bit annoying when we wanted to ride a long distance. This was such an awesome, unexpected part of our vacation, it was invaluable!"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/03/2017,"I do not recommend! System charged me much more than what was proposed! I do not recommend it because the system is meant to mislead the customer. You need to keep returning the bike every 30 minutes, which makes it difficult to use and disrupts the ride dynamics. And due to an error when I returned the bike because it did not fit properly at the station, an extra charge of USD 100.00 was charged to my credit card, without any warning, that is unacceptable! Besides the bicycles are poorly maintained, for example in my case where the bicycle seat was totally loose due to the clip being broken!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/25/2017,Excellent service Fastest and most ecological way to move through the city. Helps environment and discovering the inner beauty of NYC
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/25/2017,"AMAZING addition to NYC Can't say enough good things about the Citi Bike program. I have been a very active user since the summer of 2013. I first came most in handy when I first began dating my GF and I lived far west in midtown and she in the WV. The bikes made it SO easy to get to her in the evening/weekends. Then I have used it for errands, meeting friends, to get to work, to the subways, to events.... Its amazing and worth every penny spent. 150 of the year and you will save on car fares, time, subway rides and you will see more of the city while excising. Enjoy!"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/21/2017,"Great Idea... But terrible time restrictions We rented 2 bikes at $12 for 24 hours.. No where did it clearly explain the 30 minute restriction. When it says $12, 24 hours and unlimited in the same sentence you expect to pay $12 for as many rides as you'd like within a 24 hour period.. I think it would be a struggle to get between some of the bike docking areas in under 30mins..We had a great time riding the Hudson and East rivers, but I only realised the issue when I just checked my credit card statement and saw an extra charge for $26.13 for a date after I'd left NY.This is really a tourist con and should be avoided.. Taking the Underground or Uber would have been a much cheaper option just less interesting.."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/21/2017,Best way to explore NYC! Coming from Maine the weather was beautiful. Saw the multitude of city bikes around and had to try them. Left the west village and grabbed a couple on the awesome pedestrian path on the west side highway. Biked to battery park and back in less than an hour among other places. What a view! PLENTY of bikes on the bike path away from interior where they are needed more. A must do when in the city!
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,04/17/2017,"Bike ride in Central Park. We decided to have a bike ride through Central Park so we used citi bike rental. It was a great price for what you get, So we went into Central Park. The bikes were very heavy. When we were going up a hill the bike made you break a sweat, But it was a great price for what you got."
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,04/12/2017,"Read the Fine Print I enjoyed that my friend and I were able to rent bikes for only $16, but that $16 was accompanied by several inconveniences.First, they charge a $101 hold. In order to receive the hold back, I had to call my bank twice. We rode the bikes on Saturday, and I didn't get my hold back until the next Friday. This was tough for me, as I put myself on a strict budget when I travel.Secondly, you pay $12 for unlimited 30-minute rides--NO riding for uninterrupted spans of time! If you want to bike for longer than 30 minutes, you need to find another docking bay within the 30 minute span of time, dock the bike, then request another ride. This can get tricky. My friend and I were extremely cognizant of time and still got charged $4 for returning bikes a couple minutes late.If you want a means of transportation to get from Point A to Point B, then Citi Bike will provide that; HOWEVER, if you want a leisurely bike ride around Central Park or along the Hudson, I don't recommend Citi Bike. The stress of timing myself and finding docking bays to avoid additional fees took away from what should have been an easygoing bike ride."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,03/08/2017,"Easy to find, easy to use, easy to ride Used them to navigate our way through Central Park. Easy to find enough locations so we could keep under the 30 minute time limit. Perfect way to get through Central Park, but still be able to walk around the places you aren't allowed to cycle."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,03/07/2017,rip off! I rode the city bike for 2 hours and had 3 transactions on my acct $101 deposit $39.40 and $13.50 this company is very misleading. says that you can use it for 24 hours $12 but when I called the rep said I was charged $39 for passing 30mins. I WILL NEVER RIDE CITI BIKE OR RECOMMEND ANYONE TO GET A BIKE FROM CITI BIKES. YOUR BETTER OFF TAKING AN UBER IF YOUR TRYING TO GET TRANSPORTATION.
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,03/01/2017,"Central park NYC bike ride I rented 4 bikes to go around central park. We were aware of the 30min limit for the day pass but what I did not realize was that the time stamp started when you purchase and not when you get the bike codes. My credit card was charged the extra $35 because we exceeded by 4 minutes on the 1st ride and 1 minute on the second ride. Also, it seemed like they counted the overage based on when the last bike was docked because I subscribed to the txt alerts and I have the message showing 2 bikes were docked in time, but the 2 other bikes were a minute late. The bikes are really good for riding around central park, just return them all after about 20mins of riding to be safe."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,02/26/2017,"Best way to get around. We loved renting the City Bikes to get around. It was so much fun with our group, cheaper than a taxi, faster than the train and it gave us the flexibility to move around more often. We bought a day pass, which was great for docking and re picking up. The con's of this would be, sometimes there aren't any nearby bikes, and you can only have the bike out for 30 mins at a time. Trust me, i got charged extra time."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,02/24/2017,"great way to see NY City, especially on a sunny day day rental was very easy. plenty of stations. display screens at stations are very helpful for looking at bike routes, finding other bike stations (with bikes and spaces available). Loved the bike routes - easy to get around from 29th street to Greenwich Village to lovely ride back up the East River. Bikes are heavy - but the gearing is simple and smooth, as is riding the bike. I had trouble with the phone app. I could not see a map - which made it hard to find a station, but I could see a list of nearby stations - so with some juggling I was able to navigate. For the most part drivers were very careful and stayed out of bike lanes. Couple of double-parked cars, and taxi drop-offs, and delivery vehicles were in the lane(s). I took my own helmet - I highly recommend wearing a helmet."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,02/20/2017,"Faster than a speeding bullet Given the dismal choices of moving around the big apple (stuck in traffic or shacking on a subway train underground?) being able to ride outside and see the neighbourhoods is an amazing alternative when the weather is nice. With a one day pass we got our touring and our exercise, dropping the bikes every 30 min at a different station. The amount of stations is pretty overwhelming and is almost impossible not to find one nearby, but sometimes they might be fully occupied with no empty dock to return the bike to.so get and use the app that gives you location, availability and allows you to generate codes and unlock bikes where you need them, in addition to keeping track of time, help generating best course and identify stations. We felt quite safe on the cycling lanes . Only surprise the 101 $ deposit charged, visible in the fine prints but not highlighted during the purchase process."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,02/20/2017,"bikes were good, instructions left something to be desired This was my first experience using citi bike. I'd read up online but did not create an account or use the app. I used my credit card to rent 3 bikes - that was pretty easy. It took a minute to figure out where to put the code in, but we were good to go. Having purchased a full day of unlimited 30 minute trips, I set the timer on my phone for 20 minutes & we ventured into Central Park. After we docked our bikes for the first 30 minute session, it took a while to figure out that we needed to get new codes. when I went to get a new code, instead of getting one code good for 3 bikes, which is what I had the first time, I got a code good for one bike. back to the machine. Got a second code good for one bike. then I learned that you have to wait two minutes between getting codes. which means, at best, bike one will ""expire"" 6 minutes before bike three. what the heck is that all about? That was pretty frustrating to say the least. I still see the $303 hold on my credit card, but its only been 24 hours so I will keep an eye on it.Pros: fun way to explore an area without having to lug your own bikegreat way to get from spot to spot if you are enjoying a touristy or casual daycons: not great if you plan on a leisurely ride unless you are willing to pay $4 for every 15 minutes after the check in. While there are lots of check ins around New York city, they are not inside Central park - so we could not, for example, ride around, check in the bikes & walk right into the zoo or the skating rink. you'd have to park them out on the street somewhere and then walk back in. I would do this again if I wanted to cover a good distance without being in a car or a train. but its not cheaper than a taxi across town if you are more than one person.I would not do this again to bike in Central Park - I'd probably rent from one of the many other people there who don't require a 30 minute check in."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,02/11/2017,Credit card charged for depoist not refunded- no response They are an aboslute discgrace. Do not take the risk.We only used the bike for 30 minutes and tried to reuse within the 24 hours and couldnt.Despite this we were charged two lots of 24 hours plus a $250 deposit on our card which we are fighting for two weeks later.
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,02/06/2017,"Don't use - we got AUD $335 credit card charges for 30 minutes use of 2 bikes! We used the bikes on Central Park 4 days ago and were supposed to get 24-hours bike access for 2 bikes. To our horror we have had 3 charges against our credit card ..one AUD$ 34, then AUD$202 then another for $AUD 35. We have sent 3 emails and nothing has been fixed. We were told the $202 was just the deposit and will be reversed...4 days later it still hasn't been. Whats more the system doesn't work, it promised 24 hours access..we go 25 minutes and then couldn't access again.After using for 25 mins we put the 2 bikes into a new rake so we didnt incur any extra charges. 2 hours later we tried to retrieve new bikes and couldn't, we kept getting the yellow light. So we gave up. The next day we saw all the charges to our card. 4 days later and lots of emails we still haven't had it fixed. Do NOT USE!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,01/29/2017,Perfect! Perfect as a form of transportation (no delays and cheap!) as well as for sightseeing. My friends and I got on Citi Bikes and did a midnight tour of Manhattan and Brooklyn. So much fun!
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,01/24/2017,"recommended as a mean of transportation When I explore a new city, I prefer seeing it's streets, people, and monuments. As convenient as a subway might be, it doesn't allow you all of the above...The system is very easy to handle- just download the app (Make sure you have an internet connection), and plan your trips through the city!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,01/07/2017,"My favourite thing to do while in NY  I can honestly say this is the best thing we did while in New York! We hired the bikes to cycle through Central Park, for $12 you get 24 hours unlimited use, however make sure you return the bikes every 30 mins, otherwise you get charge an additional $4 per 15 mins. There are lots of docking stations so you will be fine! Can not recommend this enough! "
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,01/04/2017,"Same system as London  It's a great system! Rent for 24hours and return every 30mins (easy to do with the app). Never have any issues and it's lots of fun. 

In the U.K. it is £2 for 24 hours rather than $12+tax mind!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/31/2016,"Easy and fun  The service is really easy, the bikes are in very good quality. 
We found I best to use the streets with less traffic. Central Park is a must. 
This was one of the best things we experienced in New York."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/08/2016,"Brilliant , brilliant, brilliant  Citibikes are a must, we used them everyday (simply download the app, pay for 3 day pass and off you go). Brooklyn bridge, Brooklyn heights, all across manhattan. There are lots of dedicated cycle lanes which make it safe and bike stops everywhere. Be careful not to go over 30 minutes each time as you get charged. Enables you to see the sights and get fit too!! A MUST, TRUST ME "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/27/2016,Ride Citi bike in NYC Do not pass up riding the Citi bikes in NYC It is great way to get around and great way to see the city. Use the app to find Bikes and docks to park them . Do not be afraid of riding them . People are very courteous to bikers and the bike lanes are great.
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/17/2016,Life changing get places quick. membership is cheap. bikes have lights and bells. heavy structure allows higher calorie burn. stations are everywhere. they need to add more up uptown but in bk and Manhattan they're so convenient. never have to worry about your bike getting stolen. maintenance is provided by Citibank so no flat tires. I love citibike
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/16/2016,"Convenient and quick CitiBike seems to be the most efficient way to get around in Manhattan. As one who finds myself often pressed for time, CitiBike has kept me from arriving late for appointments on many occasions."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/10/2016,The best Way around Nyc.  A beautiful fall day a great ride and got me where I needed to be when I needed to be there
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/09/2016,Well worth doing. Need more gears though! I'd definitely recommend giving these a go though I've not tried any similar bike rentals for comparison. The cost is pretty fair though the docking every 30 minutes does feel a bit like a money making scheme. I found there to be plenty of bikes and stations available and they're easy to ride and adjust however it would nice to have a few more gears for tackling hills etc.
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/07/2016,"Great, but... Very helpful service
It will improve 
Not enough stations.
During busy hours too many stops are empty or full.
Bikes work well compared to imitate services in other cities.
On boarding is easy"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/03/2016,"Essential part of NYC I love Citi Bike, I need Citi Bike, New York City definitely needs Citi Bike. I don't own my own bike and use Citi Bike to get almost everywhere I go in the city. Extremely convenient, safe, reliable, and a good work out!I hope they will continue expanding to East Williamsburg and Bushwick. Their bikes have consistently been in good condition lately, I think a testament to good service and maintenance. They also transport bikes around to fill up empty stations and empty out full stations. Their app used to be glitchy which I haven't used in a long time, but they may have fixed that already."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/01/2016,An excellent way to get around NYC Citibike is an excellent way to get around NYC and a great way to see the city. I use a citibike for errands around the city or just to get a little excersize traveling from point A to B. Great for locals or tourists!
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/01/2016,"Great addition to life in NYC This program is still in its early days, but even with a few kinks, it works rather well. There is a bit of a learning curve with using the hardware and software. I have been using it several times a month. I have an annual membership so I have had the chance to use my learnings. I see the tourists struggling a bit though, especially if they don't have the app to help locate available bikes and docking stations."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/01/2016,Love the flexibility  Have used Citi Bike since they were introduced and they have gotten better every year. The. Ike's are better. The locations are more and more. The city has made more bike lanes. Over all better. There still are times when there are not bikes or docks where I need them. But with a minute of planning before a trip I get adjusted. It's not perfect but it's great. Wear a helmet even if you have to buy one before or during a ride. 
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/01/2016,"For New Yorkers and bike-friendly tourists I love Citi Bike. I use it several times a week in my home neighborhood in Park Slope (Brooklyn) and during the workday in Manhattan. It's ideal for short, one-way trips when you live in New York City. Tourists beware - unless you're comfortable biking in a city and/or familiar with a bikeshare program, it may not be what you expect. Citibike is NOT designed for a leisurely afternoon of sightseeing, and you're limited to using the bikes for 30 minutes at a time. You can use it to get from Chelsea Market down to the West Village. (Stop, walk around, get a bite, then get another bike (unlimited trips per day) and head to a different neighborhood.) But if you're looking to ride around in Central Park, you'd be better off renting a bike for 2 or more hours from one of the bike rental places in or around Central Park."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/24/2016,"Only Way To Travel Biking in New York City may seem suicidal, but it's actually the ideal way to explore the city - and fairly safe. The phone app is user friendly.The Greenway lets you cycle around the entire island, mostly along the rivers. The parts we biked were traffic free except where you had to cross streets.We also biked up and down busy avenues on specially-marked green bike lanes which often had barriers separating bikers from traffic. Other streets had bike lanes but many of these were somewhat lethal with all the double-parked cars to go around.We did the $12-a-day deal which is inexpensive with a caveat - you have to get a new bike every 30 minutes. This worked OK except for a long stretch on the Greenway along the lower East Side where we didn't see a bike station. It's an extra $4 for every 15 minutes over 30 minutes.The bikes were mostly in decent condition with 3 gears, lights in front and back and a small rack in front to carry stuff.Next time we're in NYC we plan to bike around the entire island - 30 minutes at a time."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/22/2016,"Great way to get around New York What a great way to see Manhattan on a beautiful day. Well designed concept, decent bikes, and a helpful app helps you find locations and even has a gauge to tell you how many bikes are there. You can't have an individual bike rented over 30 minutes, so sometimes you have to return it and grab another to avoid extra charges. When you return your bike, you have to push it into the bike holder really hard!Fun experience!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/22/2016,CaptDon I thought this was a great way to get around. Bikes were all I good working order. Easy to find bikes and drop in different locations.
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/19/2016,"Stupid system The system sucks, you gotta put the bicycle back every 30 minutes or it will be extremely expensive. This company could could learn a lot from copenhagen or berlin. RENT YOUR BIKE ANOTHER PLACE"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/18/2016,"Get around the City on a bike I hired a Citi Bike for the first time for the day and rode down the Hudson River to Battery Park. Then later in the day went to Central Park and rode around there which was a really nice experience. Just remember to watch the clock, as when you haven't docked in 30 minutes you get charged!"
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/13/2016,"Easy to Rent a Bike in New York City Whether you're away from home or live in NYC, it's easy to rent a bike. You'll see stands of them in many parts of NYC. Each place has a large sign displaying Manhattan and directions about paying for the bike. Some of the streets you may ride have a specific bike lane; unfortunately, though, many streets do not, so that can make it kind of scary to ride a bike."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/11/2016,"Best way to get around I love love love citibike NYC. They should make me an ambassador. I opted for a 3 day pass and found quite often citibike was the fastest way to move around Manhattan, beating uber, taxi, bus and met/subway. You get to see more than if you are simply stuck underground on the subway. You burn calories so you can eat more delicious food. If you use it as often as I did, it's also amazing value. Granted I was visiting New York during pleasant weather so this might be a contributing factor to my enjoyment. Also when I visited Harlem, there were almost no citibike stands. But everywhere else I went the bikes were plentiful and convenient and the citibike app showing location and availability was super easy to use."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/18/2016,Great Citi bike was a great way to get around the city. Super efficient and you really feel like your a local. Give it a try next time in New York
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/16/2016,"rip off these bike rents are a total waste of time. and they will cost you a lot more than what you bargain for. we rented to use around the park, we spent most of the time riding to the next station, which were out of the parks and not that easy to find. half an hour to get to the next station, its a joke! or you get charged, we were charged double the rent as finding the station were not easy, and some were just full! do not rent these bikes"
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/16/2016,"Great way to get around NYC I really enjoyed using a bike as a means of transportation. Citi bike has convenient locations throughout the city. If you're going to rent for a whole day I recommend you plan your trip according to docking stations. You must dock your bike in 30 minute intervals, failing to do so will result in a fee. So if you plan on being on the bike for more than 30 minutes you should definitely plan to ride by a docking station just to dock and avoid the fee."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/15/2016,"A Fun Way to See More We used their bikes to get to the normal tourist stuff (buildings, bridges, parks, etc.) but the highlight of these bikes was the ability to wonder around some of the very cool neighborhoods of NY. And with that I feel that we got to see bits and pieces of the city that you simply can't see or experience without the freedom a bike offers. (We normally rent scooters when we travel and this was the next best thing) However I would caution folks that it's a bit dangerous out there (cars, pedestrians, potholes, etc) so it may not be for everyone. "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/06/2016,"The best way to get around NYC Easy, affordable, fun... and you get to see the sights. Every tourist has to try the subway and a yellow cab, but this is the best choice for most short trips - especially across town!"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/06/2016,"Great idea, poor execution  I had a wonderful weekend in NYC and fortunately this was my only negative experience. Earl C review below details it perfectly. You have to check the bikes in every 30 minutes ( not near enough time) and when you find a station they are all full. I thought I was spending 26 dollars only to find out I ended up getting charged 50. Thank goodness I gave up or I would've gone broke. This really makes me mad because I enjoyed the rest of NYC so much. Whatever you do, DO NOT RENT THESE. To make matters worse, when I cAlled and tried to explain that all the stations were full and I could not check mine in, the customer service was HORRID. She refused to take off the extra charges. Lesson learned! "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/04/2016,"Convenient mobility Easy to access bike stations. 3 gear bikes makes it very easy to pedal around. Adjustable seat height makes it easy to ride. I did a lot of point-to-point rides in Manhattan. The bike lanes and city nav on the mobile made travel a breeze. Appreciated the little carrier ahead of the handle bar. All in all a green ride, hassle free, soaked up the city scenes as I road."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/03/2016,"Biiking through Central Park!! My wife and I enjoyed renting and riding bikes from Citibikes in New York. The process was relatively easy, and the bikes were clean and in pretty good shape. The baskets on the front were definitely a positive and easy to use. Unfortunately, you have to check in every 30 minutes to avoid extra charges. This is what prevented me from giving them 5 stars. This is a major inconvenience especially since Central Park is so huge!! They should have trackers in the bikes if they are concerned with them being stolen, and they should give you at least an hour or more before having to check it in between rides if you rent it for the entire 24 hour, or daily rate. You need at least an hour of cardio on a bike for it to be advantageous, and you don't want to have to worry about where the nearest check in station is, until after that hour is over.Try to fix that, and you will have more users.Thanks.EC."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/03/2016,"A different view to NYC We really enjoyed using Citi Bike. we rented it for 24 hrs. It gave us a whole different view of NYC. We started near Wall Street. we took the west side path along the water. It was really great. We had no issue with the 30 minutes limit. There were already several station along the bike path. We just choose the stations with high inventory just in case. Keep in mind that you will need to leave the bike for 2 minutes after every 30 minutes. In our case, we needed to rest since it was a very hot day. Also, please keep in mind that it you would like to get another code, for whatever reason, you will need to wait 5 minutes for the old code to expire.Another tip, make sure that your bike is in a good shape before entering the code specially the seats. Some of the seats don't stay in place even after being tightened.The iPhone app is great."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/02/2016,A great way to see NYC The Citi bike system is the same as the bike hire system in London. You can have as many 30 minute rides as you want in 24 hours for around $14 but if you go over 30 minutes on any of the rides you will be charged extra. As long as you make sure you know the location of the docking stations and use an app to check spaces and bike availability you will find it great. It is the perfect way to get around New York but try and keep to bike lanes. We cycled up to the bike route that runs all along the Hudson. It's a great day out if the weather is good. You can also go across to Brooklyn and dock and pick up bikes there. Just keep an eye on the time to get the best value.
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/01/2016,"A NYC Must Do! What a great way to get around NYC!So much fun, comfortable to ride and easy to get used to (as long as you find one way streets, preferably with bike lanes) Cars are pretty good at navigating around you... as are pedestrians. Used by many NY locals with annual passes.Tip- even if you are only using for a few days, you may be better off paying for monthly pass rather than the $12ea p/day.Now the negatives... Be sure to dock your bike correctly (when you see a green light) Otherwise you'll find yourself in a panicked Taxi ride back to its location hoping you aren't going to be charged $1200 for a lost bike. Some docks are busted.Also: using the website that shows you docking stations and bike availability is not always updated and we would get there to find it completely empty!Last small negative... they dont have baskets or bottle holders. Just a gap at front with a rope so have a suitable size bag or bumbag/ fanny pack you can hold your belongings in."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/31/2016,Bike rental in NYC The change to a 24 hour rental from last year's system of having a half hour rental is discouraging for out-of-town renters.
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/28/2016,"Very convinient, best way to explore the city You can find the citi bike stand almost anywhere in Manhattan and are really worth the price. There are dedicated lanes for cycles in most of the avenues and if you are even decent at cycling, then this is the way to explore the city"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/26/2016,"New York by bike We are a couple, both 50. We spent a week in New York August-16. This time we chose Citi Bikes instead of taxi and the subway. It cost $12 for one day, or $24 for three days. We biked around in all district on Manhatten, and we took Williamsburg bridge to Brooklyn, and Brooklyn bridge back to Manhatten. This was great! You rent a bike for 30 min at a time. That is ok because there is also a station nearby. We just switched bikes when we needed a bike longer than 30 min. If you do not return the bike within 30 min, you will get a $8 pr 15 minutes.We downloaded an app with all the stations.The cardrivers in NY is used to bikers, and there are bike lanes in many streets. We felt safe.We highly recommend Citi Bikes! "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/23/2016,"Loved the experience I was completely against it but worked out well, easy to use kiosk and plenty of stations to return, rented on 33rd street and returned by museum in central park then used it to go back to times square. When you want to rent a new one just press the green button, insert credit card used, select number of bikes and you'll get a new code. You get confirmation that you return bikes once locked as well, worked well and great communication. It was crazy driving them around the city but they worked well and they were easy to use, I hadn't used a bike in like 10 years."
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,08/17/2016,I will go other bike renting if I options The Citi overcharged me $34 except for the daily renting. I am still in the process of dispute. We will see.
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,08/16/2016,"Variable I went to early adopter with a year long pass a few years ago, but I have moved to three day and seven-day passes depending on what my hiking and biking plans.The bikes could be great or could have technical problems and it's not easy to decide until you start riding. It's part of the adventure, of course.And, the app TD works pretty well.Just be prepared to hike or take the train or even a cab."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/16/2016,"Best way to get around NYC I was staying with a friend in Brooklyn for the weekend and used the citibikes to get around. It worked perfectly and we did the whole of Manhattan as well as the Brooklyn side. Had to stop and change bikes every 30 min, since some of our rides were longer than that. Some stations were a bit temperamental and didn't always want to release the bikes the first go. I used 20 different bikes over the weekend and only one had problems with the gears. All the other were in good shape. Lots of stations everywhere and easy to find with the gps component in the station map. I would definitely use the citibikes next time I get back to NYC. I'm just hoping it won't be 110F again. "
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/14/2016,"30 minutes as many times as you want in nyc for 24 hours good locations all over the city, but can be a little tricky getting to your next stop within the 30 minutes time limit unless you want to pay a bit extra happier to bike on paths than in traffic as a tourist but good way round the park and also round less crowded areas"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/14/2016,"The best way to move around in NY I bought a 3 day pass on the internet. Walked to the first station J saw. Chose a bike. Requested a code to undock and off I went! What a great way to explore NY. The traffic at times was very frustrating and scary to move through. I think one of the main problems currently is due to all the building of roads etc going on. One complaint only, the carrier in front is too small"
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/10/2016,"Bikes availibility limited, bikes in a bad technical condition I am using the bike sharing system many times during a year since 2012. It is a great idea and much better for crusing from A to B than taxi or bus. Bikes availibility is not equal (anymore). At more and more stations, bike docks are empty with no bikes available. A lot of stations have bikes in a bad technical conditions, which cannot be used for riding. I found 6 outbof 10 bikes having some failures, which you can only detect when trying it."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/10/2016,Afternoon biking round Central Park The $12 (plus tax) fee for 24 hours of bike use is a bargain. All you need to do is change your bike very 30 mins or you will get hit with a $5 fee for every 15 mins over. We rode some - had a break - picked up new bikes and rode again. What a great approach to bike use. All bikes used were in great condition with pumped up tyres 
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/06/2016,"Best way around Manhattan Quick review - this is the best way to get around Manhattan. Fast. Efficient. 

I've been here 20 times before and walked, subwayed, or cabbed. 

Grab a bike!  Faster. And way more fun."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/29/2016,Good value - once you get your head around the maps I have used these in Washington DC so used this time in New York. You have 30 minutes included to get from one stop to the next. This can be stressful at times if you haven't clearly got your destination in mind. You must have a mobile phone to access the maps - essential! Riding in the bikes lanes in NYC was easy and there are lots of stops. Central Park was challenging as the roads for bikes are one way and there are no Citi Bikes in the northern area of the park. On the map there are stations that are coming - but I got confused and went to one and ended paying the penalty for being more than 30 minutes as it seemed to take ages to get back to the correct one.Ride along the waterfront of the river - there is lots to see and not a lot of traffic. But even riding around the streets of NYC you see so much more than you can on foot.Suggestion to Citibike: allow connecting a pay at machine to the app so that you can have an alert when the 30 min time is coming near.
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/26/2016,Great way to get around My family and I used the citi bikes the entire week we were in Manhattan. Rode from Wall St to Central Park and back. Rode over the Brooklyn bridge. This was super convenient and once you got used to returning every 30 minutes it wasn't bad. Would definitely recommend this and ride on the long bike path on the West Side.
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/25/2016,"See the city by bike It was our second day in New York City. We decided to meet with a friend who lived near by at Central Park. He mentioned that a great way to see the park was with a bicycle. As we made it through the hectic weekend subway routing at Columbus circle. We were quickly approached by several street bike vendors offering us deals. We denied them, mostly because we weren't sure what offer entailed and usually finding bad experience with handing people off the street any money value. We had seen Citi Bike kiosk across the town and thought it would be an easy go to location with plenty of locations scattered across the city. So the whole set up for renting a bike is very easy. Read the instructions, pop in your CC and out comes a code with a receipt. Be sure to add in your cell phone number because if it wasn't for that we would have had a costly bill. So we ordered a 24 hour day pass. For 2 bikes which came to $26.00 something after taxes ( $12.00 a bike ). We had planned to visit a few locations near Central Park and eat. I rate the experience average because of their tricky guidelines that some might not see. If it wasn't for us agreeing to the text message we would have not known that we would of accrued a high bill. The fine print states that you must check in the bike every 30 mins. Which means you have 30 mins to enjoy your bike before you must physically check in your bike at another kiosk. If you don't every 15 mins you will be charge $4.00 per bike. We randomly checked our text and noticed the 30 > symbol we had been over 45 mins which means we built an additional $32.00. ( at this point we wished we had gone with the street vendors that offered us initially at Columbus circle )We quickly rushed our bikes back and checked them in at the nearest kiosk. The plus side of things is that we had a great time riding them. Some of the bells didn't work ( I think we made 4 different bike transfers) and the bikes only have 3 gears. But it was a great way to see the city and Central Park. Very convenient and easy to manage. A few things to note-$101.00 holding charge per bike- no helmets provided - use disinfectant ( handles are kinda sticky)- no bike locks -you can check the bikes in any location - they do have a basket to carry things "
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/23/2016,"Great concept; TERRIBLE in reality This is a great concept, but the reality of these bikes and locations is a distant cry from what we annual membership customers are actually receiving. I can't tell you how many times I have approached a bike station only to find that there are zero bikes available. Then, I search the citibike app and realize that there are no bikes available within 1.5 miles of my location. That means that I am wasting my membership. I either have to find an alternate means of transportation (walking, subway, taxi, etc.) or sit around, wasting time, waiting for someone to ride up and dock a bike. Then, I have to hope that the bike that person docks is not broken in someway (which many many of them are).Conversely, I can't tell you how many times I have been on a citi bike and have approached a docking station only to find that dock completely full of bikes… leaving me with no place to actually drop my bike off. Then, I again search the citi bike app only to find that there are no available docks within 1-2 miles. Long story short, at least 75% of the time there are no bikes when and where you need them. And when you need to drop one off, there are no available docking stations anywhere near your destination. Obviously this company is doing almost nothing to distribute the bikes properly and relocate them rapidly and efficiently. On top of all of this, the bikes themselves are terrible. The handlebar grips are ridiculously gross, and there has not been a single ride I have taken (over 100 of them at this point) where I have not had my hands covered in black, sticky rubber when I get off of the bike. The brakes almost never work very well, and the gears are even worse than the brakes.This concept is great, especially in a city like NYC. But this company is run so poorly, that I would highly recommend not wasting your money on either a single ride or an annual membership. It is not worth it."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/23/2016,Bike NYC!!!! I rented a Citi Bike and biked from Brooklyn to the 911 Memorial up the Hudson to the Chelsea Market to the East Village down the East River back over the Brooklyn Bridge to my hotel in Brooklyn and is was amazing !!!! It is a great way to see the city and get to places you would never otherwise come across. YES - NYC has bike paths and it is safe and so much fun - do it!!!!
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/20/2016,"Refreshing way to enjoy Manhattan between meetings! I used this as a way to get to my last meeting of the day or dinner with a friend after my last meetings in town and loved being able to take in Manhattan, ride along the water, navigate like a local and get some exercise too!Bikes were very reliable and stations everywhere and love how NYC has developed user friendly bike lanes and beautiful parks along the way!Five stars"
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/15/2016,Almost a good experience.  I rented this bike for the first time as it was stationed right outside my job. Used it to go from East 61 street to 42nd Times Square as a form of getting some work out on my legs. First let me say that they have comfortable sits and ride smooth. Now I Was not that pleased with the 12 dollar fee plus tax as I was only going to rinse it there and to top it off mid way to my ride it started pouring down and I couldn't ride it anymore so I lost out. I can see it been only for tourists or people with money not for everyone. 
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/15/2016,"Total rip off. While visiting New York over the 4th of July holiday, I joined friends on a bicycle ride around Battery Park, crossing the Brooklyn Bridge, and up along the Hudson River for a great lunch. I discovered a charge on my credit card that stunned me. City Bikes of New York will rent you a bike for 24 hours for 12 dollars but, in the fine print, you must check in every one-half hour or you will be charged $4.00 for every 15 minutes after that until the bike is returned. Now, how many unsuspecting tourists make the mistake of renting a City Bike and find that charge on their cards. Can you imagine crossing the Brooklyn Bridge - back and forth - and checking in with the bike every one-half hour. I highly recommend renting a bicycle from a reputable rental agency - Not CitiBikes of New York."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/14/2016,Great way to get around  The citi bike is a great way to see New York. It is easy to rent and there are many places to bring it back. I recommend riding through Central Park.
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/14/2016,Convenient way of getting around The Citibikes are a very easy way of getting from A to B in NYC. It is not a sight or experience in itself.
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/08/2016,"Great - but longer between re-checks please Great idea and although traffic makes some parts of NYC unsuited to cycling, it's a concept sure to increase in popularity.However...could the 30 minute timeframe between check-ins please be extended? Cycling around Central Park made the experience a bit stressful as we were perpetually trying to find stations to dock the bikes, re-scan the credit card and have a new number issued to take the bike out again. Also a bit of a shame that in an otherwise fantastic number of bicycle stations, there were no stations north of mid-park.Also, helmets (as found with similar programmes in other cities) might be a nice addition for safety."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/08/2016,"STAY AWAY FROM CITI BIKE!!! BE PREPARED TO PAY EXTRA FEE!! Their app won't show that the docking station are not function in the map and charged you for overtime fee for the time you spent in docking the bike and searching for the nearby available spots!! Even you called the customer service, their representative have the worst attitude ever and are not helping at all!! The second thing is, even we received the text message stating that we docked our bike (and within 30 min) they still charged us for overtime fee. After calling the customer service, their response is that in their system its overdue by an hour!!! Won't use citi bike ever again in NYC."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/06/2016,"Perfect way to get around the city quickly! My 13-year old and I picked up, rode, and dropped off bikes all over Manhattan and Brooklyn. Except for one bike that had a noisy fender, each bike ran smoothly and safely. DEFINITELY recommend for tourists who want quick and efficient transportation between activities."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/04/2016,Let you see NYC from a totally new perspective  Citi bike is an awesome way to see some hidden and less obvious attractions of NYC. If you're keen to sightsee actively this cultural-ruch city - it's a must do!The infrastructure od the bikes worked smooth - 12$ per day keeping each ride to max 30min. We loved it!
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/03/2016,"Manhattan via Citi Bikes My 24 year old daughter and I spent three days running around Manhattan doing several touristy things which included renting Citi Bikes. We rode the paved West and East Greenway trails, rode around Central Park, and utilized the dedicated bike lanes in the city. At the end of our trip we compared notes and we both agreed utilizing the Citi Bike app and bike system was our favorite part of our NY experience. "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/23/2016,Not really designed for tourists As a resident and user of citibike. Tourists are usually better off using one of the bike hire companies if you want a bike for a for than an hour. Remember you only get 30 mins before you have to dock the citi bike then wait a couple of minutes before you can ride again. Plus extra fees for going over the 30 min add up fast! You can use them just be aware of the extra hassle you will have over regular users with a year membership. We just turn up and go with our bike key for instance. They are designed to take a lot of abuse /use so are heavy 45lb and have 3 hub gears for a reason ! You do get a fair amount of exercise though riding one for 45mins + . The daily / hourly hire bikes are a lot lighter.
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/23/2016,"So much more than just means of transportation I've been riding Citi Bike's for over a year now. I suffer from panic disorder and no longer ride the subway since it's a trigger for an attack. Faced with very little options for getting to and from work, Citi Bikes literally saves my sanity and bank account. If it wasn't for this nifty and healthy way of getting around, I'd be left broke and feeling helpless. I almost always find a bike and if I don't, there are several stations within walking distance that I can get one. My only wish is that they'd release lighter feeling bikes. The ones we have now are a bit clunky, but aside from that, they're great!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/23/2016,"wear a helmet and yield to trucks, seriously I commute to work on citibike, It solves everything!  Lose weight, enjoy fresh air, lower carbon footprint, focus mind!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/12/2016,"Fun and economical way to sightsee in Manhattan! On a whim, after being too tired to walk but not wanting to take the subway, we decided to try out the Citi Bikes and are SO glad we did! They are heavy, but probably for good reason to deter thieves; they only have 3 gears, but it's really all that's needed to get around the city for sightseeing purposes. We went all the way up to almost 60th from clear down near Wall Street. We happily pedaled past all the people stuck on West Side Highway in the traffic as we went up the bike path. We took our bikes across on 20th and it was wonderful to have the dedicated bike lane along that beautiful residential street of brownstones. It was easy to pull up the map of different bike stations. We docked our bikes for dinner and then after seeing a movie, went in search of more bikes to head back to our hotel way up on 57th street. It was cool to be able to access another set of bikes within the 24 hour period. We really enjoyed being on the bikes - and agree with other reviews about the usefulness of this transportation mode - you can really whip around the city at a clip which outdoes the subway, cab and own personal car."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/17/2016,"Visit Manhattan using Citi Bikes The concept comes from my home town's Bixi bikes. Manhattan being a relatively small island, you can visit many areas in a single day. I did the entire lower side (59th all the way south to Soho, The Village, West in Hell's Kitchen, the East side, Union Square, the University area, etc.). And biking alongside the river is such a pleasure. Stopping by in parcs, coffee shops, boutiques, terrasses, etc."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/04/2016,"How to see the Big Apple above ground If you want to really get a good look at NYC without taking one of those awful double decker bus rides or spending your time underground or paying too much for a taxi, why not try Citibike? This is a really easy way to get from attraction to attraction, or just take a spin, for not very much money. I live here and I own my own bike, but I still use Citibike on occasion, especially for longer distances or when I'm going to Brooklyn or Queens. I'll take a subway for the long distance and then a Citibike for local connections. Try it out!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/03/2016,Citi Bike is a great way to get around NYC! Bring a helmet and get around town fast and drop off your bike near your destination for the next person to use! This has revolutionized my transportation! It is especially good for riding across town or diagonally in Manhattan where there are no subways. It's also great to use along with subways to get closer to where you need to go and to get there faster!
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/01/2016,"I love Citi Bike It's has greatly improved the ability to get around the city in a timely, cost-efficient way. Citi Bike is the best way to commit to healthy, active lifestyle at a fraction of the cost of joining a gym. Highly recommended!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/27/2016,"Great way to visit Central Park The two of us hired Citi bikes to ride around Central Park and loved the experience. We were used to hiring bikes in other cities so knew the system, even though the handlebars can be heavy but such an excellent way to see a new place and very good value. We had a particularly sunny day in Central Park which made the experience that more pleasurable and we just had to remember not to get in the way of the horse drawn carriages, runners and skaters. Definitely the best way to see the Park!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/22/2016,"Gets you where you want to go, and cuts through traffic! Citibike is great because it's all over the city and can easily be used to get almost anywhere you need to go with CitiBike stations. The bikes are reliable and easily cut through traffic and congestion that Public Transportation is normally susceptible too. It's great for a run to the store, or a ride home after spending time with friends and exploring the city. Sometimes it's hard to find free bikes or free stations to park them at but not bad."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/19/2016,"USE IT ALL THE TIME Commute. Run short errands. Most of the time bikes are available. I've had two bikes stolen, even though I locked them up. Citi Bike solves that problem for commuting and shopping. Orientation on the seat is good. Upright seating gives high visibility to see cars and for them to see you. The bikes are heavy, but stable. Better for transportation than exercise, but useful for sightseeing. Highly recommended way to experience New York City and its neighborhoods."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/19/2016,"Indispensable part of NYC's transit system CitiBike is a blast. Getting around New York is about picking the right tool for the job. Virtually any trip of less than twenty or thirty blocks is done better, faster, and cheaper on a CitiBike. I just wish they had more stations and more availability."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/17/2016,"fantastic day - thanks Citi Bikes Our plan for the day was to go over to the 89th Street Community Garden on the Hudson to see a tulip festival and then hire citibike bikes and go for a bike ride along the Hudson River, around Battery Park and then a little way up the East River to Manhattan Bridge and up and over that to Brooklyn for a view back over to Manhattan and a pizza at Juliana's.....when I woke up I thought 'maybe I should just go for a walk in Central Park'...but then I thought 'go on the bike ride, it's something you haven't done..it's always been too cold on previous trips'...so I put the coffee on now and I should be OK....if it not great fun we can just go down the Hudson, dock the bikes earlier than planned and head to Central Park on foot!But....we made it...all the way...by the time we got to the bikes at 79th, I'd psyched myself into thinking we'd just ride down the Greenway on the Hudson and get to Battery Park and that would be enough. But nope, all the way....just goes to show what no prep except for walking about 15,000 steps a day for almost 3 weeks and a carb breakfast of fruit and bagel and two cups of coffee can do. Oh I did have half a very sweet protein bar at the bottom of Manhattan Bridge too...We started riding at 75th ish, loved seeing everyone out and about, including volunteers working on plantings and children playing ball and parents having a great time playing tiggy with their children (even if they did look like they were huffing and puffing a bit). We got to 41st in the first half hour, the bike docking station was full, but there was a Citibike employee there who helped enormously. So then we got to Chambers and West and swapped again. That was a fast ride too, no stopping for photos because we'd walked those two parts of length the Greenway last year in Winter and taken squillions of photos of the art and the remnants of the piers and the views, and because I have probably already taken enough photos of trees in bloom and daffodils and tulips and hyacinths. The next part of the ride was slower, gorgeous park land, I think on the river side of Brookfield Place...not quite sure; could have been Robert F Wagner Jnr Park. A few photos there. Another reason we didn't take heaps of photos is we'd been on the AIANY boat ride around the whole island the other day and I'd taken squillions of photos of the views then. When we got to Battery Park and we decided we could make it all the way, so we swapped bikes at the East side of that Park. We are going to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island on Monday, so we'll be back there then and that's when I will take more photos of trees in bloom and daffodils and tulips and hyacinths. The last bike swap was at Forsyth and Canal. Then we went up and over the Manhattan Bridge, wow - so much better than Brooklyn Bridge. The cyclists and pedestrians are on paths on two different sides of the bridge (mostly) and the path is wide and the incline not too steep. No photos, I wanted to get over without stopping just to prove I could. And I could. We parked the last of the five bikes we each hired at the river end of Parke's Camdan Plaza Park, walked around the corner past the huge line at Grimaldis, got in the short line at Juliana's and was in there 5 minutes.In all it took a little over 2 hours. (It would take much longer to ride it if you stopped for photos..if you want to do this to take photos...I would walk it. There are a gazillion photo opportunities.) The bike docking stations were easy to find...I'd mapped stations on the Greenway and elsewhere so we didn't need to ride in traffic at all. The 30 minute time limit thing without paying extra worked fine. The paths are wide, lines are marked to clearly divide the oncoming bikes from each other, and sometimes the pedestrians and the cyclists. It was a bit of a free for all around a pretty ugly area of construction near the South St Seaport, but mostly it was very easy, very attractive and great. We loved it: 10/10 to Citibikes."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/08/2016,"Pretty cool idea! We were on a 2 night family trip to NYC, trying to squeeze a bunch of fun in to a limited amount of time. The weather was nice, so we were in Central Park for a bit. My son (13) and I rented two bikes from the CitiBike stand at the top of the park. We road the entire length (mostly downhill) of the park and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, there wasn't a drop off bike rack at the bottom of the park, which is our bad for not sorting that out first. And our phones weren't working right, so we struggled with the app. BUT we were able to get the bikes into a drop off rack about 1/2 way up the park within in the 2nd half hour, so all was good. So you pay $10 for the day (24-hour period). The first 30 minutes are included. The next (and subsequent) 30 minutes cost only $4, so that's pretty affordable. If you're slick (and it's completely legal), you ride for 29 minutes and drop the bike off. Wait a minute or two, and check it back out for the next 29 minutes, which might be free. The trick, though, is knowing where the racks are (and there's an app, we just had cell phone issues). Seems like commuters use the bikes within the city, as we saw the racks at subway/transportation centers. And your $10 means you can hop on/off a bike throughout that day. We didn't take advantage of that, but $14 for an hour seemed pretty affordable for NYC. And it was perfect for the park! Bikes were adult size, so not suitable for little kids. Also no helmets. But all good. Oh with a cute bell on each bike!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/02/2016,"Great concept! Citi Bikes are everywhere! I'm a regular cyclist (mountain and road) and don't really like urban riding. And always wear a helmet... Last visit to NYC rented and Citi Bike and road from Battery Park along West Side bike trail to George Washington Bridge. Good trail, fairly busy so you need to stay on your toes... If you plan on using these bikes (which I'll do again) and you value your health, bring a helmet! And they're EVERYWHERE!!"
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,03/31/2016,"HORRIBLE! Extra charges and awful customer service.  The idea of bike rental in NYC is pretty great, however, the whole docking the bike every 30 minutes is very difficult. The second you take a bike out, it feels like you need to be thinking about the next docking station. Many times, stations would be full of bikes but none were available for rental. At one point, we walked around for about 45 minutes looking for a station with bikes we could take out, which defeated the purpose of having them. The $200 hold for about a week is just ridiculous.. Not even a hotel or resort charges such a hold for so long. I dealt with it tho, because I was told about it before renting so I knew what I was getting myself into. THE WORST PART IS, that a week after we rented the bikes, and extra charge of $184 was charged to my card. Apparently, one of my bikes ""wasn't returned and someone found it the next day"", which is clearly a lie because I returned both bikes at the same time. I can't begin to describe the frustration I felt when I saw this. The customer service representative was EXTREMELY RUDE and basically said ""it is what it is, nothing can be done"". How convinient for them to say that my bike was found the next day without any proof. They can essentially say what they want and charge you whatever they can get away with. STAY AWAY! I am currently dealing with this charge directly with my bank and will never rent Citi Bike again. "
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,03/30/2016,Awful! Don't do it  Very misleading and frustrating approach to renting a bike. It takes longer to figure out the next docking station than to rent the bike. The process is easy but what they DON'T tell you is that they will take $110 per bike for 3-5 days (I have seen up to 10 days) as a hold for renting the bike. Here's to hoping they get this right within 3-5 days or they will be hearing from me daily! 
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,01/13/2016,"Citi Bike, getting better every day! I have been a Citi Bike member since its inception. While I liked it from the beginning, I must say they have improved hugely over the last year: there are many more stations, the app is more reliable, the docking stations function better, the bikes are maintained pretty well, and the customer service is fine (the best thing: I don't need them that often anymore...). The re-balancing could be further improved, though. Also, for visitors the 30 minute ride limit is very short. Especially because they typically don't know the city that well and need a bit more time to find out where the docking stations are. Maybe introduce a ""premium"" short rental option: a bit more expensive, but with a 15 minute ride extension? Apart from this, Citi Bike is moving into the right direction. Keep on biking, a great way to move from A to B and to explore the city!"
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/25/2015,NOT FOR TOURIST SIGHSEEING This is a service for locals and commuters as you rent for 30 minutes at a time. Keep the bike for longer and you will start paying fees. If you are a well organised tourist it is a good way to circumnavigate manhattan. Download the Bike Me App and not the NYC Bikes app.
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,12/23/2015,"Unlawful holding of deposit? We had a few issues with the Citi bike system consistent with what others are saying. We will not use it again.1. The 30 min check in and check out is very restrictive for tourists. Suggest Citi bike make this to 45 mins standard especially for areas like jersey city where there are not many stations, as it's difficult to get between stations in 30 mins. 2. When purchasing the hire, clearly indicate on the screen that you will hold from my bank account a $101 deposit per bike for 10 days (as we were told by customer service - it's in the fine print of the terms & conditions) very sneaky. That's my money you are holding to use as you wish. Unlawful?3.not very clear instructions on how to reset the bike after 30 mins. By chance we found by inserting the credit card each time we could continue our journey. 4. The lock system failed at one stop on one bike. We got it to work 2 mins after the 30 mins time slot expired. When tried to continue the system would only allow 2 of the 3 bikes to work. After 20 min phone call with cust service we could continue after they withdrew the overtime penalty fee. Graciously Do they want tourists to use it or local workers? That's something for their marketing team to work on. It's a great idea but needs some refining of the system if they want the tourist business."
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,12/14/2015,"Great Idea, Bad Service There's of us hired bikes at a reasonable $9.95. The set up round the city is great and the App works very well. However watch the $101 dollar charge. They take this out of your account as Security. Unfortunately it takes up to 10 days to be put back. This meant as I hired three bikes I lost $303 dollars from the Travel Money Bank Card we had brought. By the time I get the $303 back I'll be back in the UKAlso you can only cycle for 30 mins before you have to dock the bike (though you can't take it straight back out for another 30 minutes). This really should be 45 minutes so that you can actually get somewhere before panicking about a docking station.Finally I think I would have paid $1000 dollars for the bikes just to get rid of the hordes of bike touts hard selling their own bikes and fighting and screaming at each other. Just not cricket that sort of carry on. "
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,11/27/2015,"Great Experience, horrendous overcharges Riding on Citi Bikes in NYC on warm sunny days in November was a heavenly way to see the City. BUT BEWARE - you can only take the bikes out for 30 mins at a time, misleading, coz the charge is for a 24 hour period, and if you go over you get charged $4 for 4 mins late, then another $15 for the next 5 minutes. I GOT BACK TO A VISA CHARGE OF $233 because the bIke didn't lock back into the docking station properly. I have complained and hope they'll refund it. A LOT OF FUN BUT HORRIBLY EXPENSIVE. Citi Bike you need to change your customer info. I'm sure it's the overages that pay for the system. We're tourists we don't know your ways and this charge ruined what was otherwise a wonderful visit in a very friendly, pretty City. Citi Bike, do the right things."
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,11/27/2015,"Handy, but only half hour slots! The Citi bikes are really handy for getting about Manhattan. Easy enough to use, but you only have half an hour before you have to re dock. When you do re dock you have to re enter your details and obtain another code, which is annoying. The bikes themselves have 3 gears and are well maintained. "
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,11/17/2015,"Midtown aplenty Keen for a day-out riding a bike through Central Park? Citi Bike has plentiful locations around midtown, and within 2 minutes walk of the lower corners of Central Park. One request though: Citi Bike please add locations around the north end of Central Park. Central Park is so vast that it would be nice if you could hire a bike to ride from north to south, but alas you can only hire them south side at present."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/27/2015,"Fair play.... While visiting NYC recently we took out a couple of Citi Bikes to head over to Brooklyn. The cost was $20 for two bikes for 24 hours, great value and once you do not go over the 20 minutes per journey you will not be charged any more than the $10 per bike rental.When I arrived home I realised I was charged an additional $160 on my credit card. I contacted Citi Bike and it seemed we did not return one of the bikes securely to the docking station and it was still classed as out on rental. Even though this was technically our fault Citi Bike kindly refunded the additional charge in full.One thing I found while having the bike on hire was trying to locate the docking stations as they seemed to be down side streets..?? So I had an idea which may or may not work. How about having a single blue line on the road coming from the docking stations onto the main street's which would help guide Citi Bike users to the stations..??"
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,10/25/2015,"Citibike use in Manhatten this was our first time using any kind of citi bike service so a word of warning for all newbies - take care to read all the information and note the 30 minute limit! we weren't so careful and got caught out the first day but entirely our own fault so no complaints about that! The whole concept of the bikes is great and the startions are plentiful in the areas we were using them though unfortunatly in the evening time the bikes at the stations just disappeared - during the day wasnt an issue but by 5pm there was a serious lack of bikes in all of the stations around the touristy areas of times square/broadway.I would definitely recommend downloading the free app, that way you can see where there are available bikes closest to you rather than treking from one station to another.Docking and undocking the bikes should be simple and certainly inputting the machines little printout code to unlock the bike works very well, i found the locking a little more tricky, on several occasions i would dock the bike get the orange waiting light then back to red again. eventually my husband took over the docking duty and with the use of sheer brute force managed to dock bikes on first go.Getting the green light is however no guarantee that the bikes are registered back on the system, On one occasion we docked both bikes and half an hour later when we returned to get two bikes again we were refused a code because we apparently still had two bikes out. Calling the number on screen was no help either because the lady in customer services was unable to do anything to help. we were promised a call back within half an hour by her supervisor who apparently would be able to take the bikes off our account but that never came. For all intents and purposes leaving us stranded in Chelsea a few miles from home. We used another card and opened another account but now have to go though the process of fighting fees and getting a refund and having not started that yet I don't know how successful that will be! Overall i think a great service and the reason for the average rating is the shocking customer service which by any standards should be so much better. Also if you are comparing prices to london ($9.95 per 24hrs vs £2) it does look expensive."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/20/2015,"Worst customer service ever! Last week my buddy and i purchased a 24 hour pass. It was a great experience for arround one hour. Then my friend docked his bike at the station in the Finiancial District and it was locked immovably. But when he tried to rent a new one the system claimed that the bike unlocked and unregistered. The rules says that if you do not dock your bike every 30 minute you'll get charged. And if you lose a bike or destroy it during the rental you'll have to pay 1200 dollars! Basically that seemes fair enough but it means that you're not able to move on as long as the system doesn't approve your bike as locked.So we called the customer service, and they gave us some techniques to get the bike out of the dock but it was docked rock-solid. We tried for 30 minutes while speaking with them on the phone but they could not help us. Neither us or any other customer were able to get the bike out of the dock. If so it would have been no problem to try another dock and move on. But we were stranded.In the end we had to give up but we took some pictures of the docked bike and send the evidence to Citi Bikes . We also informed them about the bike number and the dock number. In spite of that they wouldn't agree to stop our tour. They told us that we just had to wait until a mechaninc would stop by and fix the problem. But they could not tell us when. Thanks for nothing!That meant that we had to stop biking and we did not know how they would charge us. The same evening my buddy called the custumer service again. At that point they told him that the bike still was not registered as locked, but they assured him that they would not charge him for at lost bike. But.....This morning Citi Bike withdrew 1200 dollars from his account! Now we have to fight with insurance companies, banks and a foreign company (we are danes) to get his money back. All because of a miserable customer service. I'm deeply schoked and i have never encoundtered such horrible management in my whole life. I would recommend everyone to avoid Citi Bike i New York City.The biking experience is great though but choose a decent and serviceminded company. Stay away from Citi Bike."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/16/2015,"Great way to get around NYC Had a great time seeing the city on bikes... I'm not a big fan of getting cabs and getting to and from where wanted to go would take to long walking...We were all over Manhattan and in Brooklyn and had no problems finding places to park the bikes. We should've read up on the cycle lanes though cos they really make a difference. My wife wasn't so keen on busy streets. Also the bikes are very sturdy and one size fits all... I'm 6'7 and usually struggle on normal sized bikes but the extendable seat and the long fame suited me to a t...It's a great way to get around - good exercise, fresh air and what away to burn of the brunch calories.Cheers.

NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/30/2015,"Excellent way to get around NYC! I was with my 2 teen-agers & this was the PERFECT way to get around NYC for a very reasonable price! I was definitely ""nervous"" but once I got past that, I was so glad I let the kids talk me into this! Just be sure not to keep the bikes out for longer than 1/2 hour at a time which may not seem very long but you can get anywhere by bike in NYC in less than a 1/2 hour. There's an app that works well when looking for locations to pick up or drop off at!"
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/18/2015,Confusing to use I have seen this kind of bike rental in Europe all the time. Seeing in NY city.... bright blue color bikes.... get my attention right away!I try to look at the rental machine.... VERY COMPLICATED & CONFUSING!!! So not user friendly...... It is a great idea to commute in the city by bikes but seeing so many bikes parking there... make me wonder maybe the price or the operation is not so efficient that is why people don't utilize it.
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/14/2015,"So easy, glad I pushed through my fear of biking in NYC! I was really nervous about the idea of renting bikes and touring around NYC. Traffic is unreal and the drivers (and cabs!) are crazy. But, I pushed through and did it anyway and I'm SO GLAD that I did!The bike rental was so easy and there were so many locations to drop the bike off at. A few of the downsides -- it was hard to load the app on my phone, the download was HUGE and since I was traveling outside of Canada, I didn't want to waste my data. The rental time also felt a bit short for what you were paying.All in all, I'd definitely do it again -- it was a great way to tour around the city."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/12/2015,"Terribly unresponsive customer service I purchased 4 week-long passes when visiting NYC. I had no problems with it the first day, but on the second, the system claimed we didn't properly dock one of the bikes and rescinded use of one of our passes. We had followed all instructions for docking but the customer service representatives could offer us no recourse until they ""recovered"" the bike which underhandedly shifts liability to the customer.When I finally spoke to a supervisor, she promised a full refund which I did not receive. When I contacted customer service four days later, I received no response. It has been seven days since I last contacted Citi Bike's customer service and still no response.I have used bike rental systems in multiple cities and they all have similar flaws but I have never encountered such uninterested customer service."
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/09/2015,"RIP OFF! Please be warned. These bikes are available throughout Manhattan as well as other places. My wife and I innocently rented 2 bikes from the Central Park stop. It was fairly clear $10 for 24 hours rental. Ha, but wait a minute: that only allows you to take the bikes for 30 minutes at any given time. Even 1 minute over and they'll deduct another $4 from your card. Better still if you allow the second 30 minutes to elapse, they'll take another $9 from your card! My wife and I missed the first 30 minute deadline by 2 minutes, making our quick ride around Central Park $28 + tax. Furthermore, we checked our debit card and we saw a hold from NYC Bike Share, aka Citi Bike of $202!! We called them and they said they always do that and it would take 10 days to be returned. Please be warned and use one of the other bike rental companies where you can rent clearly by the hour or day etc. Furthermore, riding anywhere other than central park you're taking your life into your own hands. Impossible to ride anywhere."
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,09/03/2015,"Central Park rental Great idea... biked central park (08.31.15) and loved doing it on a bike! I failed to read the fine print (my bad) so be advised of the below! I am ok with the transaction as long as I get my deposit back with no additional charges!!What you need to know... - They charge you $101 per bike as a deposit.- If you buy the 24 hour pass for $9.95 that it does not mean you can ride for 24 hours, it means you have access to the bike for 24 hours but you have to dock every 30 minutes or you are charged overtime fees ($4 additional for 30-60 minutes over, $9 for 60-90 minutes over, and $12 for every additional 30 minutes after).- If you are docking every 30 minutes, you will have to use your credit card again (on 24 hours access) to get a new ticket for the next 30 minute bike rental.- Download the app prior to renting so that you can find docking stations. Some docking stations may be full so use the app to find the closest docking station with available spots.- There are no kickstands! Feel this is important in the event you want to stop and take pictures. My biked slipped out of my grip and landed on my leg and gave me a huge nasty bruise =o)- Make sure when you dock that the bike is locked in and the green light turns on indicating bike is locked in. I have read people being charged for faulty sensors which did not receive the bikes but I am sure that may be a rare case.I was basically charged $27.00 for maybe one and a half hours. I guess that isn't too bad... beats having to walk through the park!"
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/01/2015,"Great way to get around NYC We caught cabs, We walked the streets, we caught the subway, and then we rode Citi Bikes ! What a great way to explore the city. The fastest way to get around and the car and taxi drivers are very courteous. The ride over Brooklyn bridge was fantastic. Highly recommended. "
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/25/2015,Getting roung New York Didn't know about this great system before we got there but quickly onto it and used it everyday. Once you get the hang of it very convenient and easy to use.
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/19/2015,"Perfect way of getting around in NYC  What a great way of getting around in NYC. The system works very well and is cheap. You need to get used to the fact that you only have 30 free minutes per ride included in the daily rent of 10 dollars, but actually that makes lots of sense. These bikes are a means for transportation. But you have so many bike stations south of Central Park (for visiting Central Park by bike you will need to hold on longer to the bikes and pay a little extra), that you can pick a new bike whereever you want. I do recommend to download the app, which tells you which stations have bikes and free bike parking available and the latter can sometimes be a problem. But if you end up a full station, the system will give you additional free 15 minutes to find an empty one. Also get yourself a map that shows the bike paths, particularly the ""green"" ones that are separate bike lanes, which are safe. The nicest and very convenient one to get from North to South is along the Hudson River. Bottom line: forget the metro, get on the bike!"
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/19/2015,"Nice Alternative to Walking for Tourists if You're On the Greenway After riding the Circle Line, we wanted to check out Chelsea Piers, and then get to Battery Park. It was Saturday morning, the walk was going to take an hour, and we spotted the Citi Bikes. After some debate, we picked up 3 bikes across the street from the Piers and rolled down the Greenway - a dedicated biking and running path along the harbor. The ride was lovely. The bike path is convenient, has it's own traffic controls, and runs along an area that has been BEAUTIFULLY developed. It was a great experience and offered up some incredible views of the city and the Freedom Tower. I would suggest this option to anyone visiting the city. With the following notes...- You need to be a confident rider. Even in the dedicated bike path it can be tricky.- Keep your eyes peeled at every crosswalk. Most people aren't paying an ounce of attention.- Ride the city streets at your own risk! Drivers aren't that concerned with cyclists - I almost got the cab door treatment. My only knock on Citi Bike is the location of the bike racks. They can be tricky to find, they didn't appear on Google Maps, which is the key to my survival, and the map on their website isn't very detailed and doesn't locate you via GPS."
NYC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/19/2015,"Very Fun Experience Renting a Citi Bike can be a very fun activity, as you can easily ride and explore through the city. You can park in any Citi Bike location and simply move around the city. Riding through Central Park was a great experience that would personally recommend."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/17/2015,"Fun through central park We rented these bikes and followed the road through the park. 
The bike rental staff were friendly and helpful. The bikes were in good condition. We will be doing this again when we visit NY."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/13/2015,"Rent one, it is fun Biking around NYC is a little scary if you are timid. But being able to hop from one bike station to another is fun and seeing NYC by bike is amazing. Make sure you switch bikes within the 30 minute window or you will get charged $5. And if you go through Central Park, know that there are not stations in that area. "
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/13/2015,"Citi Bike turned Very Expensive Citi Bike New York bike rental is a Manhattan wide burb side bike rental company that make it easy to pick up a bike on the spot. It's curbside pay machine makes you believe that if you buy a 24 hour pass that you can rent the bike for 24 hours a one flat rate. What is not crustal clear is that you must re-check the bike in to a curbside rack every 30 minutes. If you don't catch this very important information, the company will charge you a late fee every 30 minutes. My experience was for a rental on July 10th for two hours and forty-five minutes. What I understood to be a flat charge of $10 for a 24 hours rental became a $10 24 hour’s ticket fee plus a $ 53.37 charge for 30 minutes late charges. Citi Bike has a very poor business announcement of how Citi Bike rental charge for their bike rentals. Needless to say, I am highly disappointed of what I thought would be a good experience of viewing New York became a very expensive and frustrating event.I strongly recommend anyone planning of renting bikes from Citi Bike to spend a good amount of time understanding the rental terms.Also, Citi Bike must change their on screen billing information making it crystal clear of their charging terms and conditions."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/31/2015,"Best way to get around Manhattan Although they have yet to expand north of 59th street, Citi bikes is an awesome way to navigate Manhattan. 24 hour rental, use bikes for up to 30 minutes for free as many times as you like, surcharges for rides over 30 minutes. You can download an app for your phone that helps tell you where the docking stations are and how many bikes are available at each and how many empty docks there are to turn your bike in. If you get to a full dock you can press a button saying it was full and they let you have more time with no charge to find an empty dock. Believe me its not hard to find the stations they are every where and along the streets and avenues that have dedicated and separated bike lanes. This beats fighting for a taxi or climbing down down down and up up up out of the subways. Love this addition to New York"
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,05/23/2015,"Nice concept, bikes are rare in some areas  Rented a couple of bikes in Manhattan. Not easy if you are not early. In areas such as East Village it is easier but not great. Bikes itself are ok. Biking in NYC is not easy if you aren't used to biking in a city."
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/28/2015,Pity.... great idea  We have done this in other cities and it has worked perfectly but the docking stations don't work properly. .... at a 30 bike station 7 don't work and you have to ride around looking for another station. We tried 4 that all had many docks not able to receive the bikes...... or being able to take 1 and them riding around looking for another ...... Not ideal for tourists as it wastes time and agrivates one!Pity.....
NYC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/10/2015,"Not ideal for tourists We decided to get a 24 hour pass to ride over the Brooklyn Bridge and explore Brooklyn. Bad move. The Citibike concept is great, for locals, but unless you know the area well and where the stations are it is easy to go overtime. The bridge was packed which made cycling slow and difficult. Finding the next station was also not easy, and in fact one station marked on the map could not be found at all. 30 minutes gets eaten up fairly quickly when you deduct the time to release your bike and the time at the other end to find a station.One pass went to waste as we could not get the pin to release a bike in the first instance.When I got home and checked my credit card statement I found that I had been charged a second amount which effectively tripled the cost of each pass. Needless to say this is being disputed as it far exceeds any overtime fees we may have incurred.We walked the entire way back to Manhatten because the ride over to Brooklyn was so stressful."
NYC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,10/24/2014,"Improvement needed! For Citi Bikes you pay 10 USD per day, or 25 for a week. You may make as many journeys of 30 minutes if you want. That is also the biggest limitation: if you go over 30 minutes, you pay extra. The advantage is that you don't need to worry if you don't want to use the bike for some time: you don't need a lock, because you can just drop it off at bikepoint.The system is now about a year old, and that means that there are still some problems. Sometimes you find a charging point completely full, or you can't manage to put the bike in. Then you need to look for another charging point. At one point we had dropped off the bikes, but afterwards we could not get another loan: the system had not registered that we had returned them. A phone call (via a gentleman in the adjoining office) has solved everything. You also need a lot of power to get the bikes out or put them back in. That is probably a vicious circle: people use a lot of power, so the system also breaks down. Sometimes lights turn red, but you can still take the bike. Sometimes there is no light, and it's impossible to take a bike. Sometimes it's impossible to borrow a bike because the machine is not working.The concept is certainly good, but still needs to be improved. At the end of the day we were a little frustrated.Back home we saw our credit card was charged more than expected: apparently we were, with one bike, 4 minutes in overtime, it costed us $4+taxes. This was due to technical problems: in the last charging point we could bring back only one bike, all the other locks were broken. We then had to go to another point, what caused the overtime."
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/21/2014,"The idea is great. The reality, not so much. We saw the bikes around the city and decided to ride them from the Intrepid Museum back to our hotel (Conrad) in the financial district. We were able to pay (although it took a couple of tries) and get the bikes. We then rode to our hotel and dropped the bikes off at a station right outside our hotel. While we didn't have helmets to wear, we were able to ride on a beltway (green way? multi-use path?) that had a bike lane. So we were safe and not riding in the streets (which terrified me, and I ride a road bike in Dallas, TX on city streets). The second time we tried to rent bikes was after we got off the Staten Ferry. At this point we had a lot of issues. Codes wouldn't work, we couldn't get the machine to take our card, etc. After the 2 stations near the Ferry didn't work we walked over to one by a museum. We finally got it to work and got the bikes out. Then we went to take the beltway back to the hotel, but due to construction the path was blocked. We were unwilling to ride on the street, in the dark, so we parked the bikes and took a cab back. We tried to rent bikes again at Central Park, but my friend's code didn't work and we couldn't get the machine to take our card (yet again?!). We finally just gave up and walked around Central Park. Please keep in mind the bikes are heavy (at least 40 lbs) and you can't shift gears. While the idea of renting a bike is great, in reality it didn't really pan out so well."
NYC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/29/2014,TAKE A RIDE! The weather was beautiful and the bikes are located everywhere. We downloaded the app. rented bikes for 24 hours and saw so much more of the city. I trip advisor for top things to do and we hopped onto the bikes and were there in no time. Simple app with so many bike locations. Just make sure to check the location has bikes before you go! 
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/29/2014,"Great way to get around if it worked We were very excited to rent our bikes for the day from Brooklyn to ride around to see the sights of Brooklyn and Manhattan but unfortunately very time we went to a new docking station the codes worked sometimes and then not at all, wasted sooo much time re entering the codes that it would of been quicker to walk. We also found it silly that yes you pay upfront the day fee then have to redo I your bike every 30minutes and I would of been charged more coz There was no way I could ride from Brooklyn to the nearest docking station in Manhattan in 30 minutes, this service needs to look at the day passes especially for older people who want to take there time getting around. We were then sooo rushed that we didn't get to enjoy the ride across the bridge. We do think it's a great idea if it works. "
NYC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/24/2014,"Good idea, limited by operational issues Citi Bike is a company that offers short-term bike rentals (30min) at several hundred different locations throughout New York City. They can be used for transportation, or for sight-seeing.We spent over a month in New York (for work), and the first week we were in town we did a 1 week unlimited pass for Citi Bike. A rental period longer than this was not an option as you need a NYC address for them to ship the key pass to.In theory, this would have been wonderful; however in practice, the system was non-functional. We did 2-4 rides per day for that week, and there was not a single time that the system worked properly. Common issues included:-Machine at bike depot would not read credit card. This is problematic as your 1 week pass is tied to your credit card. Being unable to read your credit card means you are unable to take a bike out. You would often need to insert your card 3-5 times before it would actually read it. This was an issue essentially every time we tried to take a bike out.-The code you were given to unlock a bike would not actually be a functional code. You would receive a code, only to find out that it would not unlock any bikes. You then have to wait 2 min for the lockout period to expire, before repeating the process and getting a new code. This happened about 50% of the time, and on one occasion it took doing this 5 different times before I received a functional code.-There are frequently no (working) bikes available at depots especially during peak hours. Citi Bike says they shuttle bikes around to meet demand, and I saw them doing this; however, it is not enough, and I'd often need to walk to several stations to find a bike to take out.-The website and app information about how many available bikes there are is inaccurate. An example would be the app saying there are 6 free bikes, you walking there, and the 6 bikes all being broken and unavailable to use. This was especially annoying given that finding a bike during peak hours can mean that you are walking to multiple stations.-If using bikes at late hours when there is low demand, it is difficult to find a station that has empty spaces to return your bike. On one occasion we spent over an hour trying to find a station with open spots to drop off our bike. This was made more difficult by the fact that the app would say there were open spots at a depot; however the spots it was saying were open were actually out of service. We tried calling Citi Bike and they had no more information than was available on the app - so they would recommend going to stations that ended up having no available (not broken) spots to return the bike. We were ultimately charged time overage fees for this because we spent so long trying to find an open depot to return the bikes - Citi Bike would not refund this.I would not use it again in its current form. I understand that they are currently being audited by the city for issues with operational expenses and improper equipment maintenance and may be bought out by another company in the near future. They seem like they need many operational improvements before I would use them again."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/18/2019,"I was charged $8 for 2 minutes of riding which comes in at $240/hr. They clearly relay on false advertising which is pathetic. +$16/hr for a bike rental is usury to say the least. The fact that the pricing information is embedded five clicks down again demonstrates that this company is out to screw tourists and shirk any corporate responsibility. If you use this service read the fine print, know that after 90 minutes of bike riding you'll be charge $8/ 30 minute interval or fraction thereof. I was charge $8 for 2 minutes of riding which comes in at $240/hr which is my own little form of misrepresentation. I won't be using this company in the future and I can only imagine how many others have been burned by this company. Oh and one final note, the brakes on the bikes are crap."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/15/2019,"Random fees & absolutely no customer service -- don't use unless you're willing to pay $1,200 / bike I live in the DC area and we've used the service a couple of times. It's such a great way to show friends the city. We used them most recently a couple of weeks ago for about two hours. We went to dock the bikes (there are guidelines for this, you watch videos, etc. to learn how) and began receiving texts that the bike wasn't docked. We returned to the docking station to make sure it was docked and did all their ""checks"" -- the bikes were docked. We called Capital Bikeshare three times and emailed twice that night, trying to solve the problem, but got no response. The next day we FINALLY got in touch with them and they immediately told us we'd be subject to a $1,200 stolen bike fee (?!). I explained the situation, that we had checked the bikes and tried to resolve the issue, and they said someone had JUST found the bike (?!) so they would make the feee $60 instead. I continued to ask questions and before long, when it was clear they weren't interested in what I was saying, I asked for a customer service number and the name of the representative. She said she didn't have to give me any information and hung up on me. I then contacted Lyft, the company who owns Capital Bikeshare, and was totally ignored for two weeks after multiple customer service tickets. (Keep in mind, they require your credit card info before you ride so they can charge you for anything they want afterward.) Ultimately, these bikes are a fun and cool idea. But know that if you ride them you're opening yourself up to $1,200 in fees if ANYTHING goes wrong (even if their technology fails!) with absolutely no customer service. I am not willing to take that risk, and unfortunately will not be using these bikes again."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/07/2019,"SCAM ALERT!!!!!!!!!!! They have lots of crazy fees that are hidden in fine print. My wife and I rented 2 bike for fewer than 3 hours and were billed $92. NEVER use them. If you were to rent a few bikes for your family while visiting D.C. for just a half day, you could be billed $400 or more. This is a morally reprehensible business. They are evil. This is terrible. Check out my other reviews and you’ll find they are mostly joyful. That is proof this company is a special breed of con artist. I hate them as you can tell. The owner is garbage."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/03/2019,"I will never use it again. I recently bought a day pass for the bikes, rode them around while showing friends who visited from out of town around the monuments. Was charged $38, almost 5 times the amount for the day pass! They do not tell you at the kiosk or make it clear that you need to return the bike every 30 min and get a new one or else be charged extra fees- what’s the point of having a day pass then?! Its ridiculous and just stupid. What a waste, I could have gone with a cheaper option. I’ll be making sure to never use them again."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,03/31/2019,Terrible Experience We were on the bikes for an hour and they were great. Docked them properly and the green light turned on. We got a text saying they were docked properly and now we are being charged for not doing properly and calling and emailing them they hung up on us and refused to listen.
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,03/31/2019,"Great bikeshare program and app I think many negative reviews are due to user error. You have to understand that the rented bike must be returned within 39 minutes to avoid extra payment. I did 3 day rental, big savings vs. renting per day. Using smartphone app makes it very easy to see where bikes are available and where docks are free to return. The app can help plan a trip, and it shows preferred bike routes which are safer and less hilly. Much better than my home city app for its bikeshare program. Bring your helmet and then get out there to enjoy getting around DC!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,03/20/2019,"DO NOT USE Horrible experience. Rented bikes for less than 30 minutes. Returned and locked. Was charged $94 since it was ""out for 1 day and 3 hours."" They told me the docking light never turned green?? They were so generous in cutting my fee in half to $47 - only 5 times what it costs to rent for a day anyway. Don't waste your money or time with these people."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,02/25/2019,"Take an uber or rent a scooter Took the bike for what I thought would be a $2 and was charged $94 for ""improperly docking"" - I waited 30 to 45 seconds to see that the bike was fully locked before leaving the bike. I called to explain what happened and they didn't do anything. There were no reports of damage to the bike and it was docked the following day according to the manager. However, I am still required to pay over $40. This would have never been an issue had I taken Uber or rented a scooter, but I was hoping to save money."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,01/01/2019,"Two bikes, $76 for 2 hours Although we had fun riding in DC, I am annoyed that we were charged an additional $60 for unknown fees.  We chose the 24 hour option and rode for 2hours, total charge $76!!!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,12/30/2018,"DO NOT DO IT Worst mistake of renting a bike. We were exhausted from walking and in a sketchy part of town at night, trying to quickly access a bike and didn’t realize what we agreed to. We rode to the Lincoln memorial, parked, walked 5 steps away and took a picture and someone rode off on our bikes. On the scooters (that we used all day but we’re dead at this time) they had GPS’s and you can end your ride immediately if someone takes off on it. We didn’t realize the bikes weren’t like that (first time using it) and were devastated when they were gone, and read the “you’re responsible for up to $1200 if bike is not returned” part. Called customer service immediately and the nice lady reassured me if whoever stole them returned them, she would waive the fee. Well, the man I talked to today said he would not be able to do that and was super rude and said “well I could get my manager to review it but we don’t normally waive fees.. but like at least they returned the bike”... yes we’re SUPER grateful they returned the bikes... but it was 14hrs later (have to turn them in every 30min for no overage charges) so we were charged $94 each for a BIKE that we rode for maybe 20 minutes because we “abandoned it”... at the time I was frustrated because he was making it seem like I was lying to him about the lady saying she would waive the fee, so I said forget it because he was SO rude. It was a good 20 minutes while it lasted but if you’re in DC don’t you dare get off that bike at ALL for anything at all or you’ll be charged out the butt for a bike that isn’t even worth that much money. Rent a scooter, it’s cheaper in the long run and has a GPS. The lady in customer service was awesome, but the man who I spoke to today should not be in customer service at all. Such a shame because we enjoyed the bikes but we will not touch one again due to this awful experience. Find a different bike service. Get a scooter. Anything other than being possibly responsible for a $1200 charge for a freakin bicycle."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,12/27/2018,"Do not do this We were visiting DC and my kids had rented scooters to get around town a couple times. There were none available so the decided to rent bikes. My daughter left one unattended (although in her line of site) briefly and it was stolen. She honestly didn’t understand how this worked. The kids assumed it worked like the scooters. We called the company who is of no help. They tell you to call DC police (yep, they’re super concerned over a stolen bike). Bottom line, my credit card was just charged $1200 for a maybe $200 bike. Just walk or get a scooter or buy a cheap Walmart bike and leave it there. It’ll be WAY cheaper. Zero stars if possible. "
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,11/05/2018,Do not move unless Capital Bikeshare says the bike is locked-and still no guarantee. We rented 4 bikes in DC. Read the confusing fine print about the 30 minute docking requirement. Ok. Got it. Docked the bikes the first time and got notice that 1 was not locked. Confirmed all bikes were locked (could not be moved) and left to tour monuments. Came back 1 hour later and could only take 3 bikes because it said 1 was still out. That serial number was no longer there. We called company. They said it happens all the time and whoever took bike next would be docking it within 30 minutes. It is 24 hours later and the bike is not returned. Now they are telling us to file a police report. Police say it needed to be filed when bike was noticed it was missing and we are no longer in DC. Police also said they get tons of reports that this happens all the time. We are now being held responsible. Look at the screnshot of my texts. Notice how I get a text that the bike W20305 was docked and later get a text that it wasn't returned. We spent as much time calling their customer service as we did touring the sites.
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,11/01/2018,Capital Bike Share Be aware of this bike share. There was no where on the screen that said you had to dock your bike every 30 minutes on a 24 hour pass. They charged our account over 100.00 extra instead of the 8.00 for 24 hours that you think you were paying. I read the instructions for 20 minutes and if there was a notification then its not visible and who wants to dock a bike every 30 minutes that is not long enough to tour anything and its also unnecessary its a Scam... Also be aware they will charge you 1200.00 for a 80.00 bike if you lose it.
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/14/2018,"Great way to get around We stayed a few blocks from the Capitol building and did not have a car. These bikes were our mode of transportation for 3 days! It was great. I will say, we had a few issues with the docks, but we worked it out. The ride from the Capitol to Lincoln Memorial was fantastic...especially at night! The ride back was a little rough...hence Capitol Hill - there really is a hill! There are docks everywhere! Give it a try...saves your feet and legs! And... the kids loved it! We had four teens and preteens...this was one of their favorite things to do!"
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,10/14/2018,"Checking in every 30 min Which is ridiculous when you have a whole day pass!!! 
The system keep charging for 60 and 94 which I had to call to get refunded. Beware of them continuing to charge your credit card."
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,10/10/2018,"Ride This service is an asset, not unlike the Citi bikes you will find in NYC. You will find docks of bikes throughout Washington and with a little patience you will be on one or two of these bikes to explore the city. My only grief was trying to get up and running as that process is far from intuitive. After downloading the app, selecting your bike, I confess it was not clear at first where one enters the code generated by the app to release the bike. Once we got that ironed out, we remained mindful that we only had 30 minutes to get them back to one of the docks, which we did but there was more confusion on our part on how to successfully lock them back up. Thankfully, I had a 13 year old in my company who diagnosed that problem but again, none of this is intuitive. The key is sorting all of that out in advance AND knowing how long you need the bike for. If 30 minutes puts too much pressure on you, I would opt for the longer periods as the increase in rental rate is not that cost prohibitive - it sounds like it is costly otherwise if you poorly estimate how much time you need."
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,10/05/2018,"Aussies unable to hire We were keen to ride around National Mall on a couple of bikes as it was a hot day. Unfortunately after trying to insert our credit card to obtain a ‘key’, it was rejected. Upon calling customer service we were told it was because our credit card wasn’t issued in US?! Ummmm, we are overseas visitors, of course we wouldn’t have a US credit card. We kept on trying as were advised to use the app. That proved unsuccessful too as we were unable to enter our Australian mobile number with the +61 prefix. It appears it’s only possible if you are a tourist from another state in USA. A little disappointing. We ended up walking..."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/04/2018,"Rip off, even when you stop every 30 minutes I was charged for almost $100, although I returned bikes on every 30 minutes... Story was that I did not dock bike (I did it almost 10 times that day) and that it was in use for 2 days and 20 hours... rubbish."
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,10/02/2018,"Fun ride, but tedious also  Rode for nearly 4 hours today, capital one arena to all the memorials, around the White House, up to The Capital, Supreme Court, then back to the White House! A total of 21.7 miles! The tedious part is I had to dock my bike 8 times to avoid being charged for overages!! Good thing I downloaded the app or I wouldn’t have known to dock it every 30 min.Also, a note to riders, DC streets are very dangerous to ride on! Very very few bike lanes! And very very fast and testy car drivers!! So ride on sidewalks and paths when ever possible!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/25/2018,"ATTENTION - total Ripp-off At the rental station is a price of 8 USD per day defined .... we took the bikes for 3 hours and finally 90 USD for each bike got debited of our credit card. The customer service refer to the ""small printed"" where the exact rate is defined. DON'T DO IT ... this are thieves"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/24/2018,"Convenient way of exploring DC In my opinion distances in DC (Mall, downtown, Dupont, Georgetown) are a bit too big to walk, a cab is often stuck in traffic and the subway stations don't cover the entire area nicely. So, there is a transportation void that bikes can fill perfectly. I loved using Capital Bikeshare for short urban trips. The bikes were OK (maintenance could be better) and there are many docking stations in the area. A bit of caution is needed: don't use your bike for longer than 30 mins in a row and plan carefully for the docking stations. They can be either empty (no bike available) or full (you can't park your bike there)."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/17/2018,"RIP OFF!! Absolute rip off!! Hired 2 bikes and rode around dc.. expecting an $8 fee for each bike.. next day checked my credit card and $230 Au dollars taken out of my account... When I rang to question it, I was told about the parking it every half hour and you should’ve read the tiny screen.. all 100 pages of it.. They then offered to halve the charge which means $115 Au.. very expensive bike hire indeed tourist stay away"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/15/2018,Nickel and dime you along with poor customer service I rented three bikes. Returned all three and received text that one was not docked. I was forced to drive 35 minutes to where the bike were returned to check. All of them got a green light and would not come out after docked. Called customer service who started they received a error that started we didn't dock the bike correctly. She told me if she sent someone out it would be a extra fee. I went back to the place where the bikes were returned and they were locked into place. I will never rent from this place again. Save your money because they'll find a way to over charge you extra. Horrible!!!
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/20/2018,"Dock Every 30 Minutes! I went to visit some friends in the DC area. A few of my friends used JUMP to get an electric bike and I thought I was saving money by using Capital Bikeshare because it was $8 for a 24-hour membership. If you take a bike out, make sure you dock the bike every 30 minutes and rent it out again or you will get charged a late fee of $30 dollars. It is extremely sneaky and no one who is going around to see the sites are going to focus on how long they have had the bike out. It is absolutely heartbreaking that a trip of a few hours cost me $38 because I was unaware of their late charge policy. Capital Bikeshare, if you are reading this, please please please change your business model. This is seriously awful. I can either keep the bike for the time period I need or I will have to dock the bike after 30 minutes and rent it again. Your competitors in DC (JUMP specifically) are way ahead of you. I really regret not using them and I will not be using Capital Bikeshare again until they stop ripping tourists off."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/20/2018,"Read the fine print You must read the fine print. We thought this would be a perfect way to get from Falls Church to The Mall (a little over an hour ride on these bikes) but we didn't read the fine print. The $8 for a ""24-hour rental"" covers as many 30 minute rides as you want in a 24 hours. If you do not dock or switch bikes every 30 minutes you will be charged a late fee.I will say there numerous stations to make this possible but to need to set a timer to switch bikes to avoid a late fee makes this not worth it."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/13/2018,"Great way to get around the Mall It was a bit confusing at first to figure out how to rent, but once we downloaded the app it was much easier. We rented at the Jefferson Memorial, road to Lincoln, walked to DAR, road back to Jefferson. The only hiccup was at the Vietnam Vets Memorial the bikes were all gone so we had to walk another block to pick up more (not an issue) and then when we wanted to return them the rack was full back at the Jefferson Memorial. Keep that in mind and think about alternative drop/pickup points an all is good. Bikes were easy to use, a bit heavy but that is to be expected and made for a great time."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/13/2018,"Suspicious Business Model - behind the fantastic idea! The purpose of Capital Bike Share seem's to be ""Declare Your Independence"" to the customers. But the truth is a Suspicious Business Model based on Intentionlly Misleading of the Prices. Very misleading unless you read the fine print. The rent station says. $8 for 24 hours. Most tourist just read that and rent a bike. You have to bring the bike back to a station, dock it within 30 mins and then you can rent it out again. We got popped $38 dollars each bike. Now when you are riding around looking at the attractions in DC, who is going to return a bike to a station that are spaced 1/4 mile apart. Honestly, it is the whole idea and unbelievable that partners like: Arlington County, The City of Alexandria, The Fairfax County can accept this. The tourists are left back with a feeling of Misuse credit card. And, when I called to get my refund, rep told me they get these calls all day long. What does that say for their program? Dishonest Business Based on Intentionally Misleading!!!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/11/2018,"Read the rules This is the BEST way to get around central DC, the mall, and the monuments. Read the rules. Plan on short trips and turning in the bikes or exchanging them before 30 minutes expire. The app is very helpful. There are docks near every major site you might want to visit. Make sure you securely dock the bikes - green light."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/06/2018,"Fun way to see the town We spent an afternoon riding from the Lincoln memorial to the Capitol Building making many stops along the way. It was an amazing way to see the monuments, reflecting pond, mall, WWII, and so much more. Tip, once you have your bike hang on to it. These things are in high demand."
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/31/2018,"Misleading pricing Be sure to read the pricing breakdown before renting a bike. All bikes are rented out at 30 minute intervals, even if you purchase a 24 (or more) hour pass. After the first thirty minutes, you will continue to be charged unless you return that bike and get a new one. This is not clearly laid out when you look at the pricing options and can run up your bill."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/31/2018,"Misleading Very misleading unless you read the fine print. The rent station says. $8 for 24 hours. Most tourist just read that and rent a bike. We made the mistake of not reading the fine print. There are usage fees. You have to bring the bike back to a station, dock it within 30 mins and then you can rent it out again. We got popped $28 dollars. Now when you are riding around looking at the attractions in DC, who is going to return a bike to a station that are spaced 1/4 mile apart. Worst concept ever for tourist. And, when I called to get my refund, rep told me they get these calls all day long. What does that say for their program? Misleading!!!"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/30/2018,Fun way to get around I love to ride bikes so whenever I can find them and it helps with all of the walking I definitely will ride a bike. The only downside to docked bikes in cities is that you have to dock every 30 minutes or you get charged extra so that adds a little anxiety to the ride but other than that the price is right and saves a lot of steps. It is also great after a large dinner to burn off some calories. We bought the 24 hour pass and road quite a bit but one of the nicest rides was around the tidal basin. They have the basket type area in front but what would also be nice is a bike lock and the option to grab a helmet somewhere. Definitely recommend and have fun!!!
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/30/2018,Beware Bikeshare! Scam charges No response so far. Please can someone contact me to confirm why I have been charged so much?My husband and I took 2 bikes out after paying for 2x 24hour passes. We got them from near Library of Congress and returned them in Georgetown about 2-2.5 hours later. Even your app confirms what I SHOULD have been charged. It logs the rides and how long between each docking. We paid for 2 bikes 24 hour hire. What an absolute scam!We’ve now been charged $60? It should have been $16. 
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/29/2018,Great way to get around city I came to DC with my 11 year old and we got a three day pass on Bikeshare - fun way to get around the city - best on the Mall - fun to be sure to dock within 30 min to not pay more. We did a monument ‘tour’ ride at night - safe and fun - less expensive and adaptable than a guided tour - the monuments have stations nearby and you can dock and then take the same bike back out
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/20/2018,"Couldn't get a bike First stop only one bike. Went to the next. 2 bikes, one had a flat. Call them and they tell us a station near by with 6 bikes. Get to the 3rd station and only 3 bikes. Just as we paid 2 people had swabs and left us with one bike. Had to call to get our money back and gave up. It was a weekday in early June."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/19/2018,"Shocked by the bad reviews My nephew and I rented two bikes right on the mall. They were absolutely the highlight of the trip. I LOVED how much fun it was. I came here to leave a review and was shocked at how awful some of the reviews are. I had such a positive experience.The first place we stopped to rent bikes had a line, and only a few bikes, so we kept walking. About a half mile later, we found another rental spot with lots of bikes and nobody waiting.I did find the cost explanation posted to be very confusing. It was also not easy to read the tiny screen in the bright sun. But in the end, we got it figured out, and rented two bikes. My credit card was immediately charged $4 for two bikes for the first half hour. Let me tell you, the mall is huge. So riding down the sidewalk to the Lincoln Memorial was the best way to travel. We saved so much time! And it was so much fun! I haven't been on a bike for 15 years, and it's true what they say. You never forget how to ride a bike.The only drawback was the fact that there were so many people everywhere. It was hard to ride in that area, because of course, pedestrians have the right of way. The bikes had little bells to warn people you were passing, but most people really weren't paying attention to that. We kept our bikes a bit over the 30 minute limit, and when we docked them near the White House (I found docking locations on google maps) we were charged an additional $4 for the next half hour. Still, $8 for two bikes for 45 minutes was well worth it!I did have a little trouble docking my bike. I kept slamming it into the docking station, but never got the green light. My nephew had a softer touch, and he pushed it just a little bit tighter, and got the green. I liked having that reassurance that the bike was officially returned. I also liked that the docking station had a place to indicate if the bike had any problems associated with it, so it would be checked before being rented out again. I would absolutely get one of these bikes again, but perhaps during a less crowded time of year. I would also recommend the powers-that-be try to simplify the cost structure. It was too confusing."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/17/2018,"AWFUL I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. I normally am very passive/do not give bad reviews, but felt this was such a scam. We bought the 24 hour pass for 2 bikes, which was $16 total. We wanted to visit the monuments in D.C. and ride around the city. We were out for about 2-2.5 hours.... I was charged an extra $56 because we didn't connect the bikes back to a dock within 29 minutes of riding them, and they charge you $8 PER BIKE PER HALF HOUR over 29 minutes!!! This should've at least been clarified better when checking out. Was not happy with my experience and ended up paying almost $100 for this scam of a service."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/01/2018,"Ridiculousness  We visited DC with our family, and decided to try the bike rentals out. It was an absolute disaster. You can only rent 2 bikes at a time. How does a family of 4 or more rent bikes? Someone needs to adjust this option. Then, we tried to rent 5 bikes in 3 different purchases, and that proved unsuccessful. By the time we were done there were not enough bikes. My wife had to walk. Never again!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/28/2018,Beware of costs We were recommended this by our host. We purchased a 24 hour pass for $8 each after reading the information on the kiosk Toured around with the bikes then docked the bikes as per guidance when finished. However we were then charged $60. On contacting Capital Bike share they said 'You purchased a access pass which granted you access to the bikes for 24 hours but you were still required to dock the bike every 30 minutes to avoid additional fees.'Insane to think you have to dock every 30 minutes! Capital Bikeshare have refunded 50% of costs. Not to be recommended. 
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/27/2018,"Check bikes out before renting!! I purchased a 30 minute $2 ride so I could bike around the Lincoln Memorial. At the time I didn't know to check before paying that a) enough bikes were available that weren't docked with red repair lights (those are locked into the docks and cannot be checked out) and b)unclaimed by jerk tourists who hadn't even paid yet but ""claimed"" them for their large families. The code the kiosk gives you is only valid for 5 minutes for the $2 ride, so needless to say I wasn't able to unlock a bike before it expired. Thankfully it was only $2 I wasted! The kiosks do not tell you that a red light on a bike's dock means it cannot be checked out. I went to another station and 3 broken bikes were there but no working ones. Made it to station #3 and grabbed the one working bike of the 5 docked. On the way to finally getting a bike out I saw a few people also pay for bikes they couldn't use and there's no way to refund your money.Once I had a bike though it was pretty nice. The handlebars were sticky, but what can you do? At least I got a bike. Finally."
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/26/2018,"Kiosk vs App If you use the kiosk to get your pass, you cannot use the app. You have to use a credit card EVERY TIME you check out a bike. Twice I was trying to get a code and all the bikes were taken while I was doing so. I call customer support to be able to use the app twice. They were rude and would not help me. I was stuck walking. "
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/21/2018,Do not purchase a pass from a Euroopan phone The app works well through the hotel wifi but not with mobile data at the kiosk. Purchased a three day pass but could not use at all.
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/18/2018,"Great option for getting around quickly I wanted to get from the National Portrait Museum to the White House but it was more than a mile away. I saw these bikes nearby so I rented one. I loved tooling around DC on this bike! There's even a bike path down the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue. I wouldn't leave the bike unattended as there's a $1200 replacement fee, but if you want a quick way to hit the monuments in a drive-by manner, this is for you. $8/day is a great deal."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/10/2018,"Highlight of our trip We rented 4 bikes on the night of June 10th to ride and see the monuments lit up and when they are less crowded. It was the best part of an already great trip. I had downloaded the app and understood that we needed to dock the bikes within the 30 minute time frame and with the map on the app it was easy to plan where to begin our ride so we could end up back at our car later. The entire trip was about 3 hours and we would have kept going except it began raining. Once in the car I got the texts the company sends saying the bikes are docked but I didn't realize until we were back at our hotel in bed that only 3 of the 4 bikes had docked. I called the company and the suggestion I go back to the docking station at 2 am to redock it was laughable. I explained that was impossible since it was the middle of the night, kids are asleep and it's raining out and I knew the darn thing locked in since we tried pulling them out when we docked to make sure they were locked in. They sent someone the next morning and I got a text at 6am the bike docked. I then called them and they took the charge off my Credit Card. Good customer service but having worked for attorneys I knew worse case scenario I could and would dispute the charge and force them to waste the money taking me to court of need be. But only because I knew the bikes locked in with no doubt. Overall go for it.....rent the bikes. Have a blast and make sure you get a green light when docking even if it's pouring down rain."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/07/2018,Great way to see the Capital We decided to ride these bikes because it seemed more convenient than public transportation to see many sites around the Capital. We were right and this was REALLY FUN! The city isn’t exactly bike friendly so we rode amongst pedestrians on sidewalks but it was easy and we covered a lot of ground.Our only issue was a rear brake that would bind up on one of the best bikes and so we reported this by phone to a helpful and cheerful representative.This was really a great experience for us and we will definitely do it again. The bikes were great quality and easy to adjust seat height etc.
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/02/2018,"Problems with docking costs 1200$ I had a red light while docking, but could not move the bike in or out. So, I thought it could not be stolen either and that it was put away appropriatly. However, I couldn't take out another bike at a nearby station, so I asked a staf member who was at that station what to do. He told us that he would solve the problem immediately and sent someone over. However, he didn't solve it and 3 phonecalls later, no one solved the problem either. They told us that we will probably have to pay $1200. Advice: don't use city bike share and if you do so, keep hold on to your bike till you see on your phone that the problem is solved. Even when it is in the middle of the night one nobody picks up the phone nor a service vehicle is available...... "
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/24/2018,"Very poor app I started out thinking the Capital Bikeshare app was very useful, until I got past the first level. There is no obvious way to create your account prior to buying a pass, unlike every single app in the world where the first thing you see is a button to create an account. So instead of entering credit card information and everything else they want to know in the privacy of my hotel room, the app requires you do that immediately before getting you bike while standing on a street corner. The app has a help section, but very little useful data behind it. I can learn that a ride of longer that 30 minutes costs more money, but not hour much more. Not useful. For all the money spent on the bikes and docking stations, it seems like a little more effort could be spent on the app."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/08/2018,"Highlight of my trip  I loved riding a bike throughout the District!There are docking kiosks everywhere. It is convenient and easy! You can download an app that shows you the one closest to you. I had two within a block or two of my hotel. You swipe your credit card and it gives you a code to punch in and unlock the bike of your choice. If you dock that bike and choose to get another later on in a different spot, swipe the same card and it will give you a new unlock code.I did the unlimited use for 24 hours. I think it was $8. In the morning I rode up Embassy Row, on to Washington Cathedral and then to American University. I docked the bike and ubered to Georgetown for brunch. From there I got another bike and rode to the National Gallery of Art. Docked the bike and saw some sights. Got another bike and explored Capitol Hill area, then rode back the Tidal Basin and on to Foggy Bottom. I was comfortable riding solo as a female. I used the nav on my phone to help me get around. I did not find traffic in most areas to be a problem at all. In congested spots I walked the bike on the sidewalk. I really loved this. Enjoy!"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/05/2018,"Easy to use, and a splendidly fab way to get to he main sites quickly A friend recommended these to us as a great way to see the city if you are pressed for time. I couldn’t agree more. Fun, easy to use, central, plenty of parking places. Great idea for jetting about"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/01/2018,"Great way to get around DC Great way to get around DC. Only problem is that the stations are not always that close to attractions. A few suggestions: It looks confusing to rent one but just follow the instructions step-by-step. When returning the bike, make sure the green light comes on.(You kind of have to REALLY jam the bike into the dock). The first fee is for only 30 minutes. After that, the price climbs. If you want to rent a bike for all day, rent from a local bike shop."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/28/2018,Great way to get around!! Easy way to get around. Stations everywhere and plenty of bikes available. Easy to get most places within the 30 min included time. Highly recommended
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/16/2018,"Great way to get around the city We bought the 3 day pass for $17. Well worth it! We were able to get around DC so easily, and we were able to sight see so much more than if we would’ve lyfted everywhere. The only setback was that we couldn’t always find docks, but you can add 15 extra minutes to your ride if you’re nearing the 30 minute mark."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/10/2018,"Piece Of Junk Program!! Cut to the chase, if you want to rent bicycles for more than 30 minutes and you want freedom to go wherever you want in DC for a couple of days and then return a bike... Go to a local bike shop and rent one. No matter which program you choose from Capital bikeshare they force you to dock the bikes every 30 minutes. You basically spend your whole day going from Doc to Doc just to avoid their fees. This is the stupidest bike program I've ever seen!!!! It's even worse than limebike and I don't have very good opinions of that either! Just go to a bike shop rent the number of bikes you need for your family and have the freedom to go wherever you want without the hassle!"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/05/2018,"Easy transportation, read the fine print  We rented bikes to get to the Nationals baseball stadium. The kiosk is straight forward to use. Definitely download the app so you can see where the docking stations are. There are a surprising number of stations (in a good way!) and after the game, we used the bikes to get to the Mall and see the monuments. As others have already said: be sure you understand the pricing structure. Other bikes in the area such as LimeBike can be a bit more convenient (the LimeBike I used came with a phone mount for using maps!) but they aren’t necessarily together in one place, so harder for a family or group to find and use. Also, beware if you’re on a schedule: if a docking station is full, they’ll give you an extra 15 minutes to take the bike to another docking station, so long as you request it from the full docking station. Not a big deal for a tourist but if you’re on a time schedule that could be a big hassle. Overall, the process was simpler than I expected as a first-timer and convenient bike station locations mean I’d recommend them for touring the Mall! "
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,03/27/2018,"like the other reviews, you MUST know the guidelines before renting Thank goodness I read the guidelines about having to turn your bike back in. I had intended to rent it for 3 days and thinking $17 was a steal. Glad I found out before we came that you need to ""return"" the bike every 30 minutes. After realizing that it was easy. We downloaded the app to our phone and there was always a bike stand within a few minutes walk near where we wanted one. My suggestion is to only drive to one monument or place at a time. In most cases 30 minutes is enough to get you there. We even rode from the Jefferson Memorial to the statue of Iwo Jima. it was really windy and we almost didn't make it there in the 30 minutes so would have been charged extra. We used them a lot the weekend of the March 4 our Lives event because there were so many people around. The bikes were great for us. Just make sure you understand how to use and rent them before coming. They aren't great for younger children. I would use a service like Bike and Roll to make sure to get them a proper fitting bike, helmet, and lock."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,03/09/2018,"Great way to get around  This was a perfect idea for the summer. There are many bike stands in Washington. You can rent for a day or per hour. You won’t have many bikes available at monuments (lincoln memorial for example was a problem). We arrived there and put the bikes there but when we wanted to continue, none were available at that time. The APP lets you know how many bikes are available at what location. The only things that bothered me as a tourist there: what are the road rules for the bikes (they should add this at every location. Every country has its own rules. Can you ride your bike on sidewalks or in the parks etc.?). No helmets available. And when you get a day pass, you have to enter your credit card every time with your pin. So it wasn’t clear if they were charging me correctly. Other than that, great way to get around."
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,01/03/2018,"DC Bike rental on Thanksgiving  Renting a bike in DC is a wonderful way to explore the city in ways you probably hadn’t done before; especially on traffic-free days like a Sunday or a Holiday. We rented the Capital Bikeshare service nearby the Fed Reserve and returned it Georgetown. The bikes are in excellent shape and the rental procedure is straight forward; note that the service is designed for point A to point B transportation, not for daily continuous use, as there is a 30 minute limit per use. If bike is not exchanged within the 30 minutes, additional charges apply. It’s important to consider the above in comparing with other bike services; also mind that in heavy rental times you’ll have to search through various return sites. When we rented, most returning sites were full: the app facilitates this. Overall, the experience was good, but the somewhat sneaky fee & subscription service left a bad aftertaste, even though they refunded the excess charges. "
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/08/2017,"Great Transportation Option  On my recent visit to Washington DC I took advantage of this service and found it to be a great way to get around. Just be aware that a bike rental is only for 30 minutes at a time. Easy enough though, just set a timer for 25 minutes and when it goes off, just find a docking station, dock your bike and start the process all over again. The only real downsides are that the docking ports aren’t always where you might want them to be and bikes are not always available. So using the app is of prime importance. Also check out Mobike, another great service where you just ride it somewhere and leave it. Bring your own helmet for none of these services provide them"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/28/2017,"Perfect for Experienced Riders My husband and I rented bikes to save our sore feet and get from one end of the mall to another. It was okay for that purpose, but I discovered lots of pitfalls. It is difficult to ride with so may pedestrians. I found myself getting off of my bike to avoid hitting people or while waiting to go across crosswalks. In addition to that, you have to navigate broken pavement and other obstacles. After going from end of the mall to another, we returned our bikes rather than try to ride them back to our Airbnb in rush hour."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/26/2017,"Day Membership Is Unlimited 30 Minute Rides- Not A Bike For 24 Hours I wish that I had read these reviews before renting the bikes as it would have clarified things. We saw people riding the bikes in town and thought it would be a great way to get around. We did enjoy our experience, but not the fees. They are intentionally unclear. Due to this ambiguity, we misunderstood the daily membership concept from the kiosks and therefore were charged $88 for using two bikes two times (roughly 2.5 hours and 1.5 hours) After calling to inquire about the fees, we now understand that it is $8 for as many trips up to 30 minute over the 24-hour period. Keeping it past 30 minutes costs additional fees, and these fees grow expedentially. The inquiry call did result in some money being credited back. The bike themselves were comfortable and had 3 speeds. We were were visiting the monuments and didn't find the station near the Jefferson memorial. (We were going off our memory from the kiosk by the Washington monument; perhaps the app would have helped.). When we got to Lincoln there were only 2 bikes in the kiosks and we consciously didn't turn in our bikes because we were afraid none would be there when we were ready to leave. If we had understood the concept, we could have checked them back in and then immediately checked them back out.I believe the cost structure is intentionally deceptive and therefore only give them 1 star. However, riding was fun and the metro involves a lot of walking to see all the monuments, so I hope they become more transparent and honest and that they offer a true daily rate."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/25/2017,"Careful but great i think capital bike share is a great opportunity where for only few bucks you can use the service all over the city.2 drawbacks1- you need to be careful to return your bike within 30 minutes or else you will be charged alot ! ( you can take another bike from the dropoff dock)2- You need to be careful that the destination station has empty docks, else you will need to ride to another place which might be far from destination and in the process exceed 30 minutes. My recommendation :1- install the app, and always make sure that at least 2 empty docks are free at the desired destination 2- plan 24minute trips, so whatever goes on your way, you will not exceed the 30 min threshold.finally i think this is a convenient way to commute since there are docks/ bikes all over the Washington DC and Virginia., and you do not need to worry to park your precious bike on roads, carry it on buses and metros. or leaving it in unsafe places.Hope this was beneficial"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/23/2017,"great way to see downtown dc great way to see highlights of dc in couple of hours. easy to use, and plenty of stations around. only downside is that of course most of the places you want to see are very crowded, so can be little difficult to navigate thru the crowds."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/12/2017,"Deceptive! Deceptive! Deceptive! I join the long list of reviewers who have been deceived by this company. One could, and did, assume that renting a bike for 24 hours for $8, means that you will be charged $8 for the use of one bike over a 24 hour period. WRONG! Apparently, and I could still be wrong, the $8 does cover 24 hours but, and this is the catch, you have to return the bike every 30 minutes. This makes no logical sense in any way except for the company who profits hugely for your stupidity. I recommend using the Metro. Your Metro card will work on both busses and rail or take Uber. You can cross Washington D.C. for less than $10 and they come right to your location."
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,10/09/2017,"UGH....Read the Terms and Conditions and then READ THEM AGAIN We noticed these bike rental stations all around the downtown area the first few days of our trip, and decided to give it a whirl instead of taking a cab from downtown to Arlington Cemetery. The rental screen does not give very clear instructions. there is not a rental station anywhere near the Arlington park (as far as we could tell) so we parked our bikes, and completed the tour. We then returned to the downtown area and returned our bikes. We had the bikes rented for about a 5 hour period. When my card statement arrived, I discovered we were charged $46/bike...WOW so if you understand the rental agreement and return your bike every 30 minutes to a rental station, this idea is fantastic! Im just frustrated that the terms and conditions are not stated clearly. The app is great, it gives a map of all bike stations, and if bikes are available for rent. But I think we could have taken a limo to Arlington for what our bike rental cost...Live and Learn!!!"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/22/2017,"Great quality city bike rental Very convenient to wonder around long distances in DC. The quality of the equipment is fabulous. Would recommend an extended time of rent, it's not that expensive.Loads of places to return them once finished.Somewhat complicated to understand steps to take to rent (payment and process to retrieve them) so be patient."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/18/2017,Very sneaky and underhanded company  We hired three bikes and rode around Washington DC on September 8th 2017 using the US$8 for 24 hours fee offered.Had a great time. Washington DC is a surprise and a delight. Capital Bikeshare was also a surprise but not so delightful. I later discover the fee only covers 29min rides. This was NOT clear when we selected the bikes. US$8 Became over US$100The pricing and advice of the pricing would be considered deceptive and misleading under Australian consumer law and is disgraceful by any standardsThat's why I am joining the many people on trip advisor [that I now see too late] have been equally deceived and ripped off by Capital Bikeshare.  
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/17/2017,"Under 30 minutes Capital Bikeshare is conveniently located around DC. Use the spotcycle app to find bikes and empty racks. This bike rental is ""geared"" for rides under 30 minutes to get you from point a to point b, not for crusing around the city.We rented 5 times over 3 days when our feet were tired and our trips where shorter than metro station distrances."
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/17/2017,"Looks good, but useless for foreign tourists Having seen the bike share locations, and read up about the pricing (see other reviews, and make sure you know the terms), I was keen to use bike share for our couple of days in Washington.But you put your card in the machine, and it asks for your phone number. It has to be an American standard phone number - no international code can be entered. Very disappointing - and no response at all to an email asking if there is any way round this."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/10/2017,"So practical You can find stations almost everywhere in central DC. The app lets you see where they are and how many bicycles are available. Some bikes are a bit tired, so locate a station where there are many bikes, so you can pick and choose ones which are in better shape. They only have three speed bikes. They should consider adding the seven speed version. They are much nicer to ride. There are many paths. There is one in the middle on Pennsylvania avenue which is practical. There is one that runs along the Potomac, which is nice."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/05/2017,"Great bike ride around DC but Beware of Pricing Rip-off Had a great day biking with my Daughter and her Boy Friend on a sunny day in Washington DC. Rented the bikes at a station in Arlington , had a slight seat problem so switched my bike without a problem at another station on the way to DC. Had to call Bikeshare office because the screens at the stations are small, and scratched up , very difficult to read. But Bikeshare gave me a code to switch to another bike. After having a wonderful time touring DC we ended our day on the river in Georgetown area and put the bikes into a station there. Had a great day. But days later when we got our charges for the bike rental which was to be $8 for a day rental, my charge was $38 and they were charged $40. I called the Bikesare billing office and was told that I needed to return the bike to a station every 30 minutes in order to be charged $8 for the day. This was not clear to us when we rented the bikes. The web page is very deceiving about touring for a day. I was told bu the office that these bikes are for commuters not touring. I think this was a very deceitful business practice meant to gouge tourist. I will not use the bike service again and do not recommend it."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/28/2017,"Awesome way to see the city in one day I'm surprised with all of the bad reviews on here, the bike share is really not that hard if you follow directions. You sign up at a station using a credit card. You will use same credit card throughout the day to receive a code to unlock your bikes. The most you can link to one card will be two bikes. So if you have a family of 4, you will need two cards. Not a big deal, but can be inconvenient. We did the 24 hour pass for 8 bucks each. Basically, you unlock your bike and you have 30 min to drop off at another bike station. You can literally just drop it off, swipe for another code and check it back out. I don't see why you would wanna keep it out for more since you stop at a museum or memorial and walk around, who would wanna walk around with their bike? The stations are located all over the memorials and cities. I downloaded the app and could click on a station to see if there was docking available and or bikes, and this also gives you a way to plan out your day to see everything. The app is updated in real time. If you happen to get to a station with no docks available, you can request a grace period to find another station. Also when you check your bike in, just make sure the light turns green to know you checked it in correctly. They will also send you a text message. I absolutely loved it, there's no way we would have been able to see all the sights at the mall without this. We didnt miss our 30 min deadline once, so all day it was just $16 for both of us! If i had to do it again, I would have chose to go on a weekday for less crowds, easier to ride. "
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/25/2017,"SCAM SCAM STAY AWAY FROM CAPITAL BIKESHARE  Even though you purchase a multi hour rental,  you still get hit with very high hidden fees.  What makes these fees hidden?  They are not prominently disclosed at the time of rental...  You should avoid Capital Bikeshare like the plague.  I feel defrauded."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/25/2017,"The best way to experience Washington DC. What a great way to get around in DC!I spent 4 days in the city and used the bikes every day. Signup is done in a minute or two and you are on the way. You have unlimited 30 minute rides. That seemed to be not so easy to understand for some but was pretty convenient. If you need a bike longer than 30 minutes, just set a timer and ""return"" it to the nearest station after 25 minutes and rent it again right away. After the initial signup, renting is just a swipe of your credit card, pretty fast. I had some stations where the touchscreen or the credit card reader wouldn't accept the card right away but in the end it always worked.Make sure you install the Spotcycle app! It helps you with finding bikes and stations."
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,08/21/2017,"Mixed Experience! I did a bit of research before renting these bikes, so I was aware of the 30 minute time limit. * Get the app- This will tell you the location of the bikes and how many are available at that station.* Enter a cell phone # so you get a text about the rental.I was not aware of the 2 bike per credit card limit. If you need more than 2 bikes, have another credit card on you.This was a great way to move from the top of the mall to the bottom quickly.The problem came when we returned the bikes. All 3 bikes received a green light to indicate the bike was properly docked. I also received (2) texts. Here is where I messed up. I though that meant the (2) RECEIPTS were successful. However, it actually was each bike, meaning (1) of the bikes was not successfully docked even thought we got a green light. About 30 minutes later I received a text that we were being charged additional fees for being over the 30 minutes. I called and spoke with a gentleman who asked if we were near the bikes. We were not. He said he would send someone to dock the bike. He was very pleasant. This put a damper on our time as we knew ""I Agree"" to the $1200.00 cost of the bike if anything were to happen to it. It was quite the bummer on our trip. About 45 minutes later we received a text that the bike was successfully docked. OMG was I so relieved. The cost of the bikes should have been $6.00 for 3 bikes, but I was charged $2.00 on the one credit card and $4.00 TWICE on the other credit card. Seems others have been overcharged much more so I did not call to dispute the charge. Although it does seem like they make their money by overcharges.The charges do seem confusing on the website and from other reviewers as you can take the bikes out for longer time periods, but it is a small extra charge per 1/2 hour. (makes sense) I just dont see how it adds up to such a large bill as other posters mention. I would do this again, but I would be very cautious in making sure everything has been returned properly and make sure of the charges to my credit card."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/09/2017,"Excellent to discover Washington Excellent way to discover the city.We took a one day pass and as we liked it a lot a 3 days pass.The city is so huge than you can quickly move to the next place.For us the best way was to switch between biking and walk.For those who wants only bike for hours without stopping, it is perhaps better to rent bikes. "
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/09/2017,"Very good way to see everything and fast but not in a car There is no much to say about riding a bike but few points.1) This is a great way to explore the city.2) Know that not everywhere you can reach and sometimes you have to leave them behind with all it means, someone has to watch or take a risk.3) With every CC you may rent only 2 bikes. And every card has to make a membership for 7$ a bike, this sucks a bit.This not include the rent time.4) Be careful and when there is rain you waste your rent time, this sucks as well."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/08/2017,"Ideal for frequent, short trips DC is a great city to see by bike, and capital bikeshare makes that more convenient. I like that I can take a short trip by bike, and once I dock I don't have to worry about it anymore. If I want to take the train or an Uber to my next stop, no problem! However, I'm using this as a local taking short trips. I could see this being a quick way for tourists to shuttle between museums and monuments, but it is NOT an economical option if you want to be physically riding bikes for more than an hour or so at a time. That said, while it's unfortunate that many reviewers were surprised by the charges they incurred, capital bikeshare is certainly not a scam; their pricing structure is very clearly laid out on the kiosk where you rent them. To me the biggest downside is that the bikes can sometimes feel clunky and heavy."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/30/2017,"The best way to know Washington For just 8 dollars, you can get access to bike rides all around Washington. I spent 3 days there and without this bike rental system my experience would be completely different. The city has many bike routes and LOTS of this stations, so is very easy to find available bikes to ride and lots to park them.It also counts with a free app called Spotcycle where you can check near stations and how many bikes are on each one."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/22/2017,"Capital Bikeshare is BANKING on novice users to make a docking mistake so they can profit. I rented two bikes for my daughter and myself at Wilson and 31st in Arlington on July 21. We literally had the bikes for 10 minutes -- just enough time to ride to the bottom of the hill and dock them at Arlington Mill Road -- less than a mile away. This was only my second time renting from Capital Bikeshare and I didn't re-dock the bikes properly. I happened to check my bank account on July 22 about midday and noticed a charge of $62 in addition to the $4.00 rental charge from Capital Bikeshare. I called and spoke with two different representatives who explained that one bike was returned five hours later to a station on Four Mile Run and the other had not yet been returned and was still accusing charges. Maurice said they could authorize a one-time courtesy reimbursement of half of the charges -- which could not be finalized until the other bike was returned. I drove down two the Arlington Mill station and located the bike that was parked but not properly docked. I locked it into place and called back to speak with a supervisor. After calling back several hours later, I was told a supervisor would contact me at 11 pm. Irene did call me but said exactly the same. It was my fault for not docking the bike properly, the instructions are clearly printed on the kiosk, and she could only authorize half of the charges refunded. I said I found that outrageous as an annual pass costs less that my total charges -- which amounted to $157.00. I could have purchased a day pass, a three-day pass, or an annual pass for less. I asked to speak with someone above her and was told there was no one. I called back later and asked another representative, Cynthia, for the name of Irene's supervisor. She said Ashley and Irene are the only two supervisors; there is no one above them. I find it extraordinary that a business can blindly rob people, legally. Capital Bike Share is BANKING on novice users to make a docking mistake so they can profit. If they cared about the customer, they would notify customers via text when their time is near expiring -- that would be GOOD business. I never received any notification that the bikes had not been docked properly -- even though that is a question addressed on their FAQ page. If I hadn't checked my back account, that bike would still be accruing charges. I am just asking for a little kindness and compassion. I understand that I made an unfortunate mistake, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Give me an annual pass OR reduce the rate to $25, and IMPLEMENT A NOTIFICATION SYSTEM to customers! I will make sure every online reviewer hears this story and I will never rent from a this company again -- absolutely no humanity!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/21/2017,"This is the way to see the National Mall, BUT YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO USE IT!! For $8 you can get a 24 hour pass to rent a bike. You must return and dock the bike within 30 minutes though or you will get overcharged! Download the spotcycle app and it will show you where the bike docks are in your area and how many bikes there are in real time. It really helps and I had no problems. When docking your bike, make sure the light turns green which locks the bike. Some docks aren't working properly so make sure the light turns green. When getting another bike out, you will use your credit card to get a new code. They will not charge your card again. It just gets you a new code to get the bike out again. If you do this correctly, you will be able to see the entire National Mall and all memorials in one day! BUT REMEMBER TO RE-DOCK YOUR BIKE EVERY 30 MINUTES!!!!"

DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/19/2017,"Rip-off! We absolutely loved these bikes.....until the bill arrived.. Wow - talk about misleading signage. Beware. You must re-dock your bike EVERY 30 MINUTES to avoid overage charges. Impossible in most cases. the sign should clearly spell out the cost of using these bikes. they should not be used by anybody who wants to bike for more than 30 minutes in total. They apply creative billing once you are done and the line-by-line charges are not predictable at all based on what is posted at the racks. If you are sight-seeing, find a different way to get around. It would have been cheaper to bring our own bikes with us on the plane!"
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/19/2017,"Can be very expensive if you dont know how to use it:) Always remember - you have to dock the bike every 30 minutes. Doesnt matter what kind of plan did you buy! allways check if your bike was docked properly!! Otherwise you got in trouble. Especially if you are a tourist. But otherwise it could be a very confy transport in WDC. (so to be honest, one day cost me once about 50usd and once I had to go by cab 10miles to dock my bike properly again :-D)"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/11/2017,Great experience  I read the details of the charge system up front and its relatively clear 8 dollars for a 24 hour access pass which then allows you to ride the bike. Beyond this there are multiple levels if charges 1-29 min it's free after membership. Dock the Bike and get another right away. However if you go thirty min up to hefty nice then it's two dollars. Same procedure dock and recent the clock stops ticking. Go over the hour and it get expensive nine dollars for sixty to minty minutes. Beyond this it's stupid expensive like seven hours for ninety eight dollars. So the trick is dock it every thirty min. Other than that good bikes great trails best way to see the parks. Dock often 
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/07/2017,"TOTAL SCAM! BEWARE. DECEPTIVE COMPANY We live in DC. My son's bike was broken, so I suggested Capital Bikeshare for the afternoon. The $8, 24 hour rental turned into $78!!! I called @bikeshare to find out what happened and they told me that you have to DOCK THE BIKE EVERY 30 MINUTES!!!! How unrealistic and ridiculous. Don't use them. You will be ripped off."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/07/2017,"RIP OFF SCAM!! It's a rip off scam, be aware of 8$day passes. These are not unlimited for a day(24hrs), u have to dock the bike for every 30mins, and get it extended. or else you'll end up paying hefty bills to cc. Try talking to customer service u might have chance of 50% refund."
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/04/2017,"Check you bank account... I will say, after being in DC this past weekend and renting 2 bikes, I would never tour another city any other way. This was a great experience... until I got home and checked my bank account. I rented 2 bikes at $8 each and we went over our 30 min by just a few minutes, twice. I should have been charged an additional $8 total for those few minutes, which I knew I would be. I was charged $98 and when I called they said it was because I didn't dock one of my bikes correctly the night before. This also explains why I couldn't get my bike on Saturday. I had to use a different credit card to get my 2nd bike and spend another $8 for a new 24 hour rental. I made sure both bikes were docked correctly according to the lights that blink. I'm being refunded $92, but no apologies or accountability for a flawed system, at best."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/03/2017,"Be Careful - Poor Information  I rented 4 bikes for 2 hours 57 minutes last week and they changed U$128 to my credit cards. Their explanation was:""You purchased a single ride pass which cost $2.00 each. The single ride pass includes one ride of 30 minutes or less, when you have a trip duration over 30 minutes then you incur usage fees. The usage fees are calculated base on the duration of the trip. Your trip duration is 2 hours and 57 minutes incurring usage fees of $30.00.each bike""Unacceptable, expensive experience!!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/03/2017,"Scam This company is a scam. The ""all day pass"" is extremely misleading. It is not truly all day, it is all day 30 minutes intervals of docking, so if you go over 30 minutes without docking, you get charged. So you cannot ride anywhere for longer than 30 minutes, and you cannot ride anywhere that doesn't have docking station, but sure, let's call it an all day pass, that couldn't possibly mislead anybody. I got hit with a $62 charge on top of the $8 ""all day pass"" charge. Really? They also will not refund you the full amount when you call and explain what happened.Don't waste your money, rent from a real bike shop. I could of bought a bike for the price they charged me."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/01/2017,"Rip Off You think the bike costs $8/day to rent - NOT!  Beware if you don't dock the bike every 30 minutes they charge huge fees!  $94 for us for one bike!
Customer service said these are only for commuting, not hourly rental!
Complete Rip Off!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/25/2017,Great Service ruined by absolute rip off charges - BE VERY AWARE OF THE SMALL PRINT!! Used this service in other major cities including London and NY - used it in DC to show some visitors around the main DC monuments. Its very misleading when you take out the 24hr pass for - what you think - is $8 per person. Only later did I notice that they had charged me an additional $76 for riding around the capital for 3hrs!! Got a very sarcastic woman at the help line explaining to me that its clearly stated on the receipt paper from the machine (NO ITS NOT!) that there would be extra charges for more than 30 minutes usage at a time. It wracks up to $8 per 30 minutes after the first 90 minutes - complete rip off!!!
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/18/2017,"Awesome Ride Awful Upcharge due to Unclear Procedure My friends and I loved riding these bikes around DC. We were in from out of town and enjoyed getting the exercise and the adventure of finding the bikes at the different docks and heading down from Adams Morgan to the mall. We happily and smugly rode around the enormous mall and covered so much more territory than we ever could have on foot. We stopped and ate at a fun restaurant, parked (not docked) our bikes and fully enjoyed our day... until ...the next day my friend checked her credit card and we got the sticker shock. Two bikes -- $108 for 4 hours of riding! And we signed up for $8 (x2=$16) for 24 hours. What the heck? WE HAD NO IDEA THAT WE HAD TO DOCK THE BIKES EVERY 30 MINUTES AND TAKE THEM OUT AGAIN IN ORDER TO KEEP THE CHARGE AT $8. Had we read Tripadvisor's bad reviews we would have known. Too many people have had this happen to them. Bikeshare refunded half, and their customer service was able to explain clearly on the phone that this is the procedure, but nowhere in the written verbiage does it indicate this odd procedure. The procedure makes sense if one thinks about the bikeshare being a commuter service first, but tourists need better information about this funny check-in, check-out thing. I had checked out the website to see how it worked beforehand, and $8 for 24 hours seemed simple enough. The grid of pricing shows upcharges for time ranges, but the overriding message was $8 for 24 hours and so the upcharges felt like they belonged to a different category. I am disappointed that such a great idea and well executed system cannot simply add this language to their website or FAQs. I have no doubt that tourists like me might have chosen to pay some upcharge for the convenience of having them out for longer, OR we would have enjoyed the challenge of finding docks every 30 minutes like a treasure hunt. I would guess that the 25% of 1 star reviews (at this writing) would be 4's or 5's if they would fix this problem of understanding. AND I think Bikeshare would earn their upcharges with knowing consumers rather than getting the upcharges from consumers who end up feeling deceived. Just so unnecessary. PLEASE note the procedure and the upcharges if you go past 30 minutes without docking, and THEN have a great ride!"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/17/2017,"The best choice I loved rent this bikes on Washington, is easy to rent and I think is the best way to go to the attractions but sometimes you have a problem to left the bike in some points because they was totally full of bikes and you need to find another place near of the attraction to left your bike. "
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/11/2017,"The BEST way to see D.C. What a great idea!! We chose to forgo entering any museums on this trip, deciding to simply explore all the monuments. We started at the Supreme Court and made our way down the National Mall all the way to Arlington Cemetery. After then looping around the Tidal Basin we made our way to Georgetown where we returned our bikes. It was a full day adventure, and at our pace. It was remarkable!!! I will admit to being shocked about the final cost ($120 for the two bikes for 6 hours of rental). That part seemed rather deceptive in light of the ""24 hour membership."" But, considering all we saw and did it was worth it."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/07/2017,"Unethical company Renting bikes to sight see is always a good idea, which we (2 adults) did for an evening, paying Cn22.31 for 24 hr ""membership"". We spent 3 hours with the bike, and later, back home we had the very unpleasant charge of an extra Cn$116.30. Thought there was a scam, somebody cloned our card, etc and called the company. We were then informed that you need to park the bike every 30 min and take it out again not to incur extra charges. And those charges get progressively bigger...and where were those stations where you were supposed to ""check your bike in out"" placed? Are we all supposed to ride for only 30 mins and look for those bloody bike stations rather than enjoying the scenery, monuments, etc...? Most people won't do that or go over time by the time they could find such things. Designed to be a perfect scheme to rip people off, who, like us, thought, as in many countries we have visited, we could keep the bike for a determined amount of time for a fixed charge. I noticed as i was posting that I was not the only one that felt to that sad scheme. Taking advantage of people who actually prefer to rent a bike to see the city being ecologically friendly. I suggest look elsewhere, there should be more ethical business of the type around"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/05/2017,Only way to see the city  This is the only way to see the city if you have limited time. The bikes are easy to rent and multiple locations to pick up and drop off bikes....I would suggest downloading the app for ease of use. The city is very bike friendly.....there are bike lanes as well as ramps on sidewalks. The way this works is you pay a membership fee either for 24 hours ($8) or you can do 3 days ($17) then you pay each time you use the bike. If your ride is less than 30 minutes it is free so the best thing to do is have a plan and once you enter your code to get your bike ride there and drop the bike at the nearest station. Once you set up your initial account then it reads off of your credit card and it is much quicker to get bikes. Make sure when you drop your bike the light is green and the bike is secure before you walk away. 
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/02/2017,"Scam! Don't use! I would not recommend using their services for bike rental in D.C. First of all they'll trick you by saying you can rent bikes for 24 hours for only $8 and later when you check you're credit card you incurred more charges from them cause it doesn't tell you that if you have it out longer than 30 minutes you will be charged extra. Then when you do try to return the bike near your destination good luck finding an open spot, you'll have to ride an extra 10 minutes past your destination to find another docking point and then walk back to your destination. Save your money and your time and go with someone else. "
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/01/2017,They're everywhere! So easy and cheap! Use the app to find them We rented two bikes for one day and used them all over town to visit the monuments and museums. Saved our feet from a LOT of walking. Very easy to use (I recommend downloading the app to see how many bikes available and where they are located). D.C. is a very bike friendly city and I would highly recommend this cheap way to get around town to everyone.
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/26/2017,"Excellent customer service After having a terrific experience on the bikes, I had an equally terrific experience with the customer service team. I accidentally failed to dock my bike properly, resulting in a very big penalty fee. When I explained the situation to the customer service team, they were flexible enough to split the difference with me, refunding me half the penalty even though it was really my fault. There was no arguing about it, they were pleasant and made the decision quickly. Awesome activity, awesome staff."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/24/2017,"Fun way to see the sights What a great way to move around in the touristy areas of DC. The prices are reasonable, the system (once you run through once or twice) is easy to use. Once when we were returning the bikes one didn't lock properly. We called in for customer service and were treated very nicely by a real person. Not only did she help us get the bike accounted for, she helped us understand how the payment system works. The hint is, ""return your bike every 30 minutes to avoid extra fees."""
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/19/2017,Best way to see DC Loved the option of utilizing the bikeshare. Understand the system before undertaking. A payment of $2 gives you 30 minutes with the bike to then be returned at any of their bike stations (there is a good phone app that helps track the bike stations and availability of bikes and return slots). If you go beyond 30 minutes you will then be charged extra fees. This applies even if you purchase the 24 hour pass. To stay within the fixed rate and keep from additional fees you must return the bike within 30 mins. All in all it is a much better alternative than taking a cap from one monument to another. Highly recommended if you do not want to walk.
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,05/17/2017,"The Good and a few cautionary tales The good:We really enjoyed riding the bikes down the Mall to the Washington Monument. The bikes were solid and easy to ride. (Even for short people.) Saved a lot of time and was a fun way to end the first day. The cautionary tales:1) We needed 2 bikes and there were 2 in the rack. However, one had a red light, which we found out meant it was out of order. So, we had to walk one bike to a second station to rent the 2nd bike.2) read the review thread about checking your bikes into the docking station every 30 min. This didn't happen to us, but it easily could have since we used them just under 30 min and we didn't know about that rule.3) Take a video of yourself docking the bikes in. We followed the instructions and our station had the correct sounds & lights, plus the bike was securely docked. (we tried to pull each out). HOWEVER, the docking station must not have been working because after we left, someone took one bike out and kept it for 12 hours. We were charged $97.Fortunately after 5-6 calls they refunded the money (1/2 at first, then the other 1/2).We had lots of documentation of our whereabouts due to google tracking, etc. but could have used a video of us docking the bikes. Might have made the refund process easier."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/12/2017,"CONFUSING The bike share concept is a good one. The devil is in the details. As two day tourists, we were taken by the system--had to pay 200.00 because we didn't ""dock our bikes"" every 30 minutes. SHEEZ, we would have had to spend all of our 30 minutes looking for docking stations instead of biking to our destinations. We read and re-read the confusing directions before swiping our credit card. Membership fees, minutes.....+ this + that...WHAT?? Taxation without Representation...DC has figured out a way to get more of my hard earned money."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/05/2017,Deceptive Pricing Like most other reviewers on here I was unaware that there were any usage fees for over 30 minutes even when you purchase a day pass. It is not clearly advertised at stations that these fees exist. We paid $16 for 2 day passes and were charged an additional $44 in fees. This should be clearly advertised at all bike stations. It's not really worth it to have to go find a bike dock every 30 minutes because you'll probably spend half the time looking for the nearest station/figuring out how to dock the bike/accessing a new code.
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/03/2017,"Great way to get around Parked on almost any corner, you'll find the bikeshare bikes. These are a great way to discover the city. Do keep in mind that the costs go up after 30 minutes - these first minutes are practically free. Use the bikeshare app to find the nearest spot for a bike or for a parking place once you're done. Recommended: cycle down the Mall towards Lincoln Memorial at night."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/01/2017,"Biking around Washington, DC We loved biking around DC. The BikeShare bikes are easy to use. It's a fun and inexpensive way to get around and get exercise at the same time. As long as you keep your trips to 1/2 - 1 hours each, it's very affordable. A 24 hr pass for $8 lets you take as many 30 minute or less trips as you want. Tips: use the locator on the kiosk to jot down locations of nearby docking stations, so you don't find yourself running over the 30 minute limit because you can't find where to drop the bike off. Each kiosk will tell you 8 nearby locations."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/27/2017,"Very Usefull Capital bikeshare has been very useful for me in capital. First day i was walking through the city couldn't cover much places. Second day i came across the bike share and its been very useful. Most of the stands are near the attraction place. And easy to drive on the road, bikes are in excellent conditions "
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/25/2017,"Awesome! So, I see the other reviews of the people who did not read the pricing completely and I get that it is not super clear. However, I rented 2 bikes for $8 each and road them all over D.C. for the 24 hours and never incurred extra charges. We had a blast visiting all the monuments and museums via bikes. We turned it into a fun game to find the next bikeshare station in the 30 minutes. Use the bikes and dock them every 30 minutes, and they will be an amazing way to see Washington on your next trip! "
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/22/2017,D.C. Perfect city for biking This is the best way to see D.C. A number of roads have bike lanes. Bikes are good quality. Here is a tip - don't just take a bike and leave.Should have read locations as didn't find the website helpfuwhile trying to read on my phone. 
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/22/2017,"Beware As others have said...Capital Bikeshare is very deceptive in the communication of pricing. I needed 13 bikes for a school trip, I used several cards to get bikes for everyone. We used the bikes for a little under 4 hours and was charged $100 including the rental for 2 BIKES! Called and was refunded 50% on each card. Even though I explained that I called and talked to a representative prior to purchase and was never informed of needing to dock the bikes every 30 minutes."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/20/2017,"Consumers Beware My boyfriend and I decided to rent bikes through ""Capital Bikeshare,"" as we saw it as a great way to get around to all the monuments in a decent amount of time and it was. That said, the pricing of the bike rental timeframes is totally misleading!! For example, we decided to do the 24hr pass for $8 each, even though we knew we wouldn't keep the bikes for that long. That said, 24hrs for $8; can't beat it, right?! Well, that is definitely not the case and judging from the numerous negative reviews read since receiving an additional $76 charge two days post-docking our bikes for good, we are not the only wrongly informed consumers who have been charged outrageous prices unknowingly. After seeing the additional $76 dollar charge, I typed an email to ""Capital Bikeshare"" inquiring (I will update this review when I hear back) about the charge. I also looked through all of their ""FAQ's"" and ""Help"" portions of their website; however, nothing touched upon this topic. I was extremely concerned, so I went to the ever trusting ""tripadvisor"" for help and learned that Capital Bikeshare does not have a great reputation with consumers and their misleading prices have affected many travelers pocketbooks! ""Capital Bikeshare"" really needs to be upfront and honest regarding their costs and additional charges, and even if these extra charges are listed in the fine print (I have not read this yet), my personal opinion is that they need to make it more visible /noticeable at each docking station, as I have gathered that most often ""Capital Bikeshare"" is a spur of the moment type of purchase; it was for us anyway, and the only rates we noticed were the very low-cost prices front and center and no warning of extreme additional charges. Through my readings on tripadvisor, I noticed that one reviewer stated when she called Capital Bikeshare, they told her that the $8 pass is for 24hrs, but it only covers the first 30 minutes. If you do not want to be charged, you must check in every 30 minutes at a docking station. This to me is complete trickery of Capital Bikeshare. It also creates an inconvenience for the customer, as there are very few docking stations around and I didn't notice a single one near the memorial district, which is largely the area traveled with the bikes. All in all, I will NEVER use Capital Bikeshare again; they are a rip off company!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/18/2017,"Beware! They false advertise a 24hr pass for $8. After paying that, you must redock the bike every 30 minutes so you do not incur additional charges. After keeping our bikes for 4 hours I owed over $60. Advertisement is not readily available. Even on their website it doesn't call out the true cost until the very bottom. I would just be very aware of what you are getting yourself into. "
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/17/2017,"Easy way to get around the city, especially in the Mall Metro can be unreliable and its stations too sparse sometimes. Traffic is too horrible for car or rideshare especially near the Mall. Walking is sometimes not a realistic option between two points.The perfect solution? Biking! But not everyone especially visitors has a bike, so Capital Bikeshare solves that problem!This bike-sharing program is seriously the best innovation I've seen in DC! Years ago when I first got to DC, getting around was a hassle, but with Capital Bikeshare, I could explore more on bike during my 2nd time back in DC. With so many bike docks throughout the city, it's usually not a problem finding an available bike unless you are around super-popular point like Lincoln Memorial.If you have at least a day pass, you can use the bike as many times as you want without extra charge as long as you ride for less than 30 minutes each time. Just make sure if you dock your bike properly (wait for the light to turn green) after you're done or else you'll be charged after 30 minutes! Use the Metro or rideshare to cover the extreme distances, but if you are traversing medium to short distance especially throughout the National Mall, I highly recommend using Capital Bikeshare!"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/17/2017,"Excellent way to get around the city, a bit confusing at first. Inexpensive. These bikes were everywhere and it was a great way to get around as the monuments are very far apart. It is a bit confusing at first...you rent with a credit card and there is a charge for being a ""member"" $8. Then, I think, $2 per 1/2 hour. The charges were a bit confusing. They only allow you to rent 2 bikes at a time and we needed 3 and put them on 2 different cards. They do hold an amount on your credit card (about $100-$150 for each bike). You can return them to any station throughout the city, however, there needs to be an empty space to put it in. This might be difficult sometimes. They don't provide helmets. In the city, you have to ride on the street and there are no bike lanes (not ideal for kids). When you are on the National Mall, you can ride on the paths, however, there are a lot of people and other bikes. Good experience and would do it again."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/15/2017,"Great way to see DC  My son and I used bikeshare for a day on the mall. I had visited the website before renting the bikes and the policy of checking the bikes in every 30 minutes was clearly stated. The reviews by people claiming this is a scam demonstrate how many people don't read. There are docks all over the place and the website shows where bikes and docking spaces are available. We actually had an easier time finding bikes than free spaces. Even though we went over time on one segment, it was only an extra 4 dollars and the convenience and fun of the bikes was well worth the $20 we spent. I recommend checking the bikes in and out at every available dock to reset the timer and avoid extra charges. We will definitely do this again on our next visit to DC. "
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/13/2017,"First time I've never tried bikeshare before but i will definitely use it again. I was visiting DC and had a couple hours to get to the National Mall and to the Vietnam Memorial Wall. We rented bikes with my credit card and away we went. There was also a bike station in front of our hotel. I was really nervous because I'm 4'10"" and my sweetheart is 6' tall. We were both able to adjust the bikes to fit. There was a carrier on the front for my backpack, a bell and three speeds on the bike. The biggest hazards were all of the other people. I'm glad i tried it! "
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/10/2017,"Works most of the time but when it doesn't it can cost you lots of aggravation I have a yearly membership. Lots of the policies are silly. Like 30 minutes before you have to return the bike, when NYC is 45 minutes. Most of the time this service works efficiently but increasingly bike stations will not have any bikes available and anywhere from one to three bikes that need repair. Alternatively you will try to return a bike to a station with multiple slots free, but there is a glitch in the system. I get the impression that no one is driving the train. Are any progressive city politicians paying attention to this. Get some better management."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,03/27/2017,"SCAM SCAM ALERT!! READ THE FINE PRINT, BE CAREFUL. I do not support this company.I do not support this company based on principal of their shady business practices.I do not have enough bad things to say about this company, their people, and their practices...I first rented a bike to take to the grocery store and the touch screens were broken and it was a very poor experience attempting to get a bike rental, given the screen didn't work well. I can only assume based on this experience that maybe they don't upkeep the equipment well enough. Okay, so bad first impression, but once i finally got a bike, it obviously worked fine as a bike should. No flats, no issues, no problems.The second time I rented a bike, it was for a ""24 hour"" period of time, quoted at ""$8"" for the entire period. Now comes the fun part... a few days later i was charged an additional $94!!Apparently, you are supposed to dock the bike every 30 minutes or else you will be charged outrageous amounts for the time (that you supposedly already paid for). This is not disclosed in an obvious location or anywhere in the prompting on the tiny screen in front of you. This is only noted in the extremely long and arduous to read ""Terms & Conditions"" (which by the way is about 156 pages or so, and would take hours to read on the tiny screen provided for you)I immediately called Capital Bikeshare to dispute this charge and see if they would give me a one time waive, considering I did not damage the bike and followed what I had believed were the appropriate procedures. I spoke with 1 lady, Lawanda, who was a smart-alec and not helpful... She was only offering a 50% reduction of my fee and was trying to help get management (UNACCEPTABLE). Unfortunately I had to hang-up for another call coming in. I then had to call back and spoke with Brandy, who could not get her phone off of speaker or was having some kind of feedback loop issue with the audio. That may not have been her fault, but regardless, not helping my frustrations. At this point I am incredibly fed up and disgusted with this company. I have read other reviews online dealing with similar situations I had only realized after the fact."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,03/20/2017,A great addition to your visit to DC This is a great little company that will help you get the most out of your visit to Washington DC. It takes a little bit to figure out how it works but once you get it it's a great addition to traveling from one area to another. We give this company the credit for us being able to accomplish as much as we did. Some of the bikes are in need of repair and it is your responsibility to let them know but it gets to be that there are so many that you give up .If you decide to do this be sure to download the app Spotcycle that will allow you to know how many bikes are getting one location and locations that have a spot for you to return the bike. It was a great addition to a beautiful day. 
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,03/11/2017,"Great with Caveats Amazing time riding the bike with family around the Washington Mall. Best way to tour the area. Caveat #1: Prepare to have someone stay with the bikes as the rest of the group goes to visit monuments (e.g. Lincoln Memorial). Caveat #2: We had great difficulty finding empty spaces to return the bikes, had to go back and forth between sites looking for spaces which resulted in separating the family and wasting an hour of our precious visiting time. Capital Bikeshares will provide you a free extension at their kiosk if no spaces but sitll rom for improvement."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,02/21/2017,"used the bike for 4 hours on Saturday morning Feb. 18, 2017 It is a bait and switch scheme. Just beware of how the game is played. I used the bike for about 4 hours for what they said would be an $8 charge starting around 8:00 am. Supposedly you can use it for 24 hours BUT they don't tell you, and I did not realize until I returned home and saw additional charges, that unless you check it in every 30 minutes you will actually be charged $46. If I had checked it in every 30 minutes I would have been charged only the $8.00! No information or guidelines were provided that this is how the game is played. JUST BEWARE ! IT IS RATHER DISAPPOINTING THAT THEY WOULD DO THIS, especially on a quiet Saturday morning when no commuters were using the bikes."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,12/21/2016,"Beware of the fine print ! Close to a scam ! Yes, indeed, a 24-hour membership still forces you into the 30 minutes periods of actual usage time and then you have to find a free slot at your destination. Nothing of that is being explained upfront, instead their web page suggests that with the 24-hour membership you can actually use your bike freely for one day. Upon calling the customer service their reaction made me feel that they actually count on tourists falling into that trap."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/05/2016,"Really great way to get around DC! We used Capital Bikeshare for one day on a recent trip to DC. The first day we walked around DC and by the end of it we were exhausted. The second day we got bikes first thing in the morning and used them all day! The way it works is you pay $8/per person for 24 hours of access. If you keep your rides under 30 min (not hard, there are loads of stations to trade your bikes out at/you'll want to go inside places and see things!) then the rides are free. If you go over 30 minutes, you have to pay additional charges (not much, I think they said it would be $1.50 for a 90 minute ride). I highly recommend this to tourists, you will thank yourself for saving your feet from walking and saving your bank account from getting taxis/ubers everywhere. "
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/02/2016,"Highly recommend My teenaged sons, husband and I enjoyed riding bikes all 4 days we were in DC. There was a dock two blocks from our hotel and there were docks near everywhere we wanted to go. You just have to be mindful of the time and park or check in and out at the next dock within the 30 minutes so that you don't incur additional fees. DC drivers seemed used to sharing the road with bikes as many locals have bikes too. We rode on both sides of the National Mall (our hotel was on the Air & Space side but we rode as far as the White House side) and around the museums and monuments and Capitol Hill. We even took the subway to the station near the Marine Memorial, walked a block to a dock, got bikes and rode 1 mile to the memorial and docked a block from there. Parked there and after spending some time there we checked bikes out again and rode back down to a dock and walked to the Metro station. So easy and fun!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,12/02/2016,"read the fine Print They charged me $80 for a single day bike - where i docked the bike within 30 mins every time. Upon talking to them they said the bikes dock sensors did not show it was docked - even though they agreed the bike was at the station.Typical customer service - they started telling me about the ""Terms and Conditions"" that i agreed to as a part of signing up for the service. They gave me a lesson on how we should read the fine print in all the services that we take up."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,11/16/2016,"Poor quality Docks sometimes don't work so the bike cannot be checked in at the end of a ride, so the user is charged until Bikeshare fixes the dock. Horrible quality."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/15/2016,"A great way to see the monuments! We are new to the Bikeshare system. However, after spending a day on the bikes we loved it. The app tells you the locations of the bike racks along with how many stations there are and the current number of bikes at the location. The cost for a bike for 24 hours was $8. This is hinged on you docking your bike at a bike station every 30 minutes. If you accomplish this there will be no additional fees on your credit card. However, if you do what my son-in-law did earlier in the week and not dock the bike the cost adds up fast. There are plenty of bike stations and bikes to get almost anywhere you want to go around the Mall.Also, we took 5 bikes out each time (2 per credit card) and the maintenance was excellent. If there is a problem with the bike you choose you just put it back in the rack and press the maintenance button and someone will fix the deficiency quickly.It was a great day."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/27/2016,"Step by Step to Hire a Bike in DC without Fines 1-Plan you trip ahead, the places you intend to visit2-Must have the internet on your mobile3-Download the bike share app, and get used to the app, how to search, timer,...4-Must have google map as well in case you are lost5-Must have credit card6-Check how far the bike station away from your attraction7-Simple simple register for one day, so you pay 8$ and get the code8-check which bike is in good condition, brake, tire pressure before using the code, Now times starts for the 30min9-Enter the code and pull the bike out of the look, if you suspect anything , just return it but Be SURE the Green light beocme one, means everything is OK10-Before using the code, it is better you have located your next station, where there are Empty docks, if you are unlikely when you arrive, follow a procedure to extend the time.11-My advice, Enjoy even if you did not catch up the 30min, and pay 2$ from your card( will be done automatically)12-Your safety and the others is a priory, so don't rush13-If you forgot the code, or did not get the paper, just use your credit card again to get a new one.14-Once get back the bike, you can either get another one or the same once again immidiatly, I used to keep the same one.Myself, I could tour DC for 10 hrs without any fine, just for 8$, but it was a challenge, since I was alone, but I could do it with all attractions visited, it needs planning ahead.Visit the share bike website to get close to the experienceGood luck"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/21/2016,"A fantastic way to move around DC I was in DC for over a week for business visiting from Australia. A 3 day pass is $US17, then the registered credit card is used each outing to obtain pass code to pull a bike from the rack. You are billed for time used - which is very cheap. Less tha 30 min is free, so I would ride from hotel to metro, and park bike at nearest bike rack so it was free use. I did a big ride from crystal city to Georgetown along the Potomac which was great. when I reached the destination parked the bike, walked around for 2 hrs, then found another bike rack, picked another bike then onto mall. There are bike stations everywhere so you are not left holding a bike while you go for a wander, if you do it right you will only pay the 3 day fee"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/21/2016,"Don't rent these bikes Seems like a great idea, but when you go to pay for a bike it tells you it is $8 for the day but does not tell you how much it charges you for every 30 minutes you have the bikes out. My family and I rented three of them and used them for the day to go to the monuments, the capital and even to dinner (we actually went inside and got ready thinking we paid for the day). I received a charge for $282 for one day of bike rentals. I called customer service and they said there is nothing they can do about it. We could have rented much better mountain bikes for $40/day."
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,10/11/2016,nice way to move around however app could be better we used the bikes to move around in Washington mall area and near Rock Creek park.If you stay under the 30 min they are free. However it is not very clear sighted were you can find the next bike station and if there is still room. So be aware were you are going and if there is a station nearby.
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/04/2016,"a great combination near all Metro stops Get the mobile app, read up on city bikelanes, and you can easily cover so much more ground in the city, combined with Metro subways. Some stations will have hard to read screens, so remember what they ask you each rental. People ride on the sidewalks all the time, so don't fret while in downtown, just be curteous. A 3 day rental for 2 was easy to work with. When you do have issues, their CService center takes care of you quick. You should have the app, not just for locations, but also to confirm parking or rental availability."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/22/2016,Don't do this Pricing for single trip is unclear. Tried to contact the useless customer service which ended up terrible.
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/16/2016,Scam Scam Scam Rented 2 bikes to tour DC.expected to pay $24 or so based on 2 bikes for 3.5 hours based on rates stated on website ie: $8 for 24 hours. Got home only to see cc charges of $124.00 plus the $16 membership fee.Total Scam.Called Capitalbikeshare to no avail getting only 50% credit as they say bikes need to be checked in every 30 minutes.This is also a joke as we looked for 45 minutes to find a bike rack when trying to leave and almost missed bus as first 3 racks were completely full and couldn't even check or return 1 bike. Never will use again.
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/13/2016,Great bikes. Cheap way to see DC I grabbed a bike for a solo night tour of the National Mall.  I rode from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol and back.  So much fun for so little money.
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/12/2016,"Deceptive, SCAM! This is a scam. You think you are getting a bike for $8 for 24 hours. We used them for 3.5 hours. They charged an additional $46 per bike for not docking/ checking it in every 30 minutes. So riding two bikes for 3 hours cost $108."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/12/2016,Scam! Do not use! Agreeing with everyone else on this as it is a scam. They advertise making you believe you can use the bike within a 24hr period as much as you want only to surprise you with a large charge on your credit card. If you're using it for less than 30min then go for it but any longer and I advise taking the subway. Also FYI they refuse to give you a full refund if you ask for one and claim that it's because it's a government program and can only refund 50%. They need to be investigated by the BBB and the local government.
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/08/2016,"Shysters! Stay away! Renters beware! The limit is 30 minutes per ride, but they make sure to keep it on the down low and in the fine print so you are less likely to pay attention to it and rack up charges. I couldn't believe how lucrative this company is and how they get away with it. Oh wait! It's because of their 132-page terms and conditions document that you have to sign. Until they add a screen (that isn't buried within the 132 pages of terms papers) that reminds riders that they are only limited to 30 minutes per ride, I urge everyone to stop using their bikes! They need to learn that this isn't how you do business and be successful."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/06/2016,"Great way to get around without killing your feet We had a great time using these bikes that are stragegically located around the city. We used them to park a bit further away - cycle into town - walk around, cycle back. Every once in a while we would cycle through the city too. They are cheap to use - only 2 dollars for up to 30 minutes. Be careful going over the 30 minutes then you pay an extra 8 dollars just for a 24 hr memebership, plus a fee for us of an additional 2 dollars. Fees go up from there.Certainly a good thing to try.Bikes are meant for adults - not for kids."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/03/2016,"Great way to explore all the governmental buildings and monuments on hot days Easy to use, available everywhere, we enjoyed touring the different monuments, would definitely rent a bike again in DC"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/31/2016,Overcharging is their approach Be very careful when you rent from them.  They will charge you extra even when you return the bike correctly. Rent and return with great care.
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/22/2016,"Eight bucks, no waiting... Renting a bike in a city used to cost $80 or so for the day, but Capital Bikeshare delivers that for $8. The trick is to keep each ride under 30 minutes each and you can ride all day for nothing more than the daily membership charge of $8. This is, more or less, personal rapid transit around a fairly flat city with a decent number of bike lanes, paths, and (outside the center) ride-able sidewalks."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/12/2016,"Fun to explore on bike I loved the bike share program, especially the cell phone app that shows where the kiosks are and how many bikes are available. It was a little game to figure out where you could get to in 30 minutes to check your bike in and out for another 30 minutes. The bikes were all in good shape. Since my hotel was on a hill, I rode down to Georgetown and then to the mall area (all downhill). It was great to ride in Rock Creek Park. Washington is a very bike-friendly town. When I was finished for the day, I just hopped the metro back up the hill to the hotel."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/11/2016,"Made Our Trip Amazing My boyfriend and I visited DC for the first time this month to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. Being our first time and looking to keep it as a budget friendly trip, we were a bit nervous about how to navigate the city without spending a fortune on Taxi's or Ubers.Capital Bikeshare was our saving grace. I looked into hop on/hop off tours, bike rentals, segway tours...you name it, but they all came with hefty price tags.Bike Rentals were min $20pp per day. Capital Bikeshare has a 3 days Membership for $17pp. This allowed us to have unlimited trips for free for 30 minutes a trip.This allowed us to visit all of the monuments, museums and even bike the city a bit without any worries and saved us so much time. It was also SUPER hot and we were so thankful we had a bike to get us from point a to point b so quickly rather than spending more time in the humid hot sun.The APP is a MUST!!!! I used this APP all weekend not only for bike locations, but as a general GPS - lol. It was great being able to see where we were AND if there was bikes near by if we wanted to grab one.As highly as I recommend this to anyone visiting DC and how I will look into these services in any other city I visit, there is a slight downside which is why I scored them a 4/5 instead of a perfect 5.The downside is hoping to gosh the location you're going to either A) has bikes or B) has open spots for you to dock the bike. The app tells you how many bikes are available and how many open ports there are and is pretty real time, but it is not completely accurate, especially in the really busy locations. In the super busy locations like near the Lincoln Memorial, they truly need MORE bikes. We had a bike that took us there, docked it, and 20 minutes later when we wanted to move on, there were no bikes at the 2 closest locations. We probably spent a good 40 minutes between both stations waiting for a bike. At one point, we saw 3 bikes available, and in the 5 minutes it took us to walk across the street, they were gone. So then I saw that another station a few blocks away had 9 bikes. While we were walking there I saw it go down to 7, then 6, then 4..only for us to show up as a family was booking the last 4 bikes. This happened to us another time where we saw 4 bikes at a location and by the time we got there only 1 was left. And one time we got back to the station near our hotel and it was full so we had to ride 4 blocks away to dock it. Another couple was with us who didn't have the app. They were going to ride to the closest location which also didn't have any available docks so they followed us to the next one. While this didn't deter us from using it, we know it's just due to it being so popular and such a good option to get around the city, I just wish they had more stations, closer together incase of no docks or no bikes, and more bikes!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/11/2016,"The only way to do it!  The DC bike share program is fantastic! And the city itself is incredibly bike friendly- lots of bike lanes and accommodating drivers. When you rent the bike, the first 30 minutes are free, then it's $2 for the subsequent 30 minutes. However, if you dock the bike every 30 minutes you continually get the free 30 minutes. So, ride 30 minutes, dock the bike for 5 seconds and then take the very same bike out for another 30 minutes. There are docking stations all over the place, so it's pretty easy to find them. Remember to pass on the left and ring your bell! "
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/10/2016,"NOT FOR TOURISTS DO NOT USE THESE BIKES IF YOURE A TOURIST. THEY WILL LITERALLY PENALIZE YOU FOR USING THESE BIKES AS A BIKE RENTAL. keep in mind that the ""all day pass"" doesn't mean you can have one bike all day. It actually means that you can only have a bike for 30minutes at a time. pass that time and you will be charged extra. yes even when ascending the trek from georgetown to the national cathedral.I unfortunately had to pay nearly$50 extra because I was misinformed and didnt see the ""fine print."" This is a borderline scamming company and I would never recommend this to anyone."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/09/2016,"Best summer transportation when visiting DC Capital Bikeshare depots (the red bikes) are all over the city. Get the app (spot cycle ) for the up-to-date map and bike availability real time!! We get to see so so much more of the city via bikeshare!!! Im so glad we could bike as much as we did, given the busy traffic and tourist. By the way - we only biked on sidewalks which luckily they were pretty wide!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/08/2016,"Be Aware!!! Questionable Business Tactics!!!!On July 11, while visiting DC, I rented a bike and returned it within 30 minutes. Upon returning the bike, I locked it in place, pulled it a couple of times to verify that it was safely locked, and walked away. The bike was now in the hands of Capital BikeShare and not mine. Days later, upon reviewing my bank statement, I noticed a $94 withdrawal by Capital BikeShare on July 13, in addition to the $2 for the July 11 rental. I had left DC on the 11th and was not in DC on July 13. When I called Capital BikeShare, I was told that I had used the bike for 14 hours......that I had not locked the bike in properly.......that I should have waited 1 minute for the green light to come on.......that other people had used that bike and I was charged for their use (because I failed to lock it in place).........All made up lies, when in fact I DID verify that the lock was firmly secured before I walked away AND only used their bike for 30 minutes on July 11.After repeated rude attempts to talk over me, ""Corey"" mumbled that he would submit a 50% refund. When I asked how Capital BikeShare was going to refund/correct the unauthorized withdrawal, he admitted that he did not know, and rushed to hang up. From the reviews I have read online, I suspect that this is their normal modus operandi. And they do not issue a receipt.Be aware!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/03/2016,Tourists Beware of Capital Bikeshare Don't use Capital Bikeshare if you are a tourist.The bikes were great and it's a wonderful way to get around the mall. BUT if you don't return the bikes every 30 minutes they charge you an OUTRAGEOUS amount. I was charged $136 for an afternoon with 2 bikes! They are ripping off tourists. When I called they offered me a maximum of 50% discount (this obviously happens a lot) and an email address for the municipality of DC for further follow up. Go to a local bike shop and rent a bike for a day. Much better deal. You know what you are paying!
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,08/01/2016,"If only you could find a place to drop them off... 5 is a big number when it comes to cycle share. Actually any number bigger than 1 is an issue. We stayed on Capitol Hill and wanted to cycle the National Mall. Stop at the Lincoln Memorial. Then on to Georgetown. Easy. Finding 5 bikes was a bit of an issue, but the stations aren't far apart. The bikes are heavy, but sturdy and well cared for. Cost looks fair. It only becomes an issue if you are over an hour on any one journey. Ours would be easily under. The problem arrives when you want to drop off. The Mall stations were nearly full, though we managed. Georgetown was completely full. There are 4 stations and we visited them all. Only 1 slot was available. That makes a mockery of the system. You get heavily penalised in cost and can't do what you planned. Be careful. "
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/26/2016,"Trouble with docking and retrival of bikes. There are multiple stations everywhere for these bikes, so it's convenient. Also seemed like a lot of fun so our family wanted to get four bikes. We paid for four, but two wouldn't come out with the codes which were supplied at the kiosk. So, two of us rode the bikes and two of us walked to the next station we saw and immediately put them right back in the station. They just don't work well. Based on these other reviews I'm now seeing, I hope my credit card doesn't get charged for the two bikes we couldn't get out of the rack. Seems fun, but these things were just a pain to operate."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/25/2016,Bad information!!!!!! We got charged 156 dollars because we didn't know that we had to dock the bikes every 30 minutes.... This was NOT very clear when we rented the bikes - tricks a lot of tourists........
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/12/2016,"Read the reviews, terrible. This seems like a great idea as there are docking stations all over and it sure cuts down the walking. There were 5 of us, with younger children. We were using the app to try to find a place to return the bikes. We were in crowded dt DC and had to walk the bikes. The app would say there were open docks, so we would walk blocks only to find they were not open or not working. So we would walk blocks to another to find the same thing. We lost valuable vacation time, we were exhausted, and then to add insult to injury, we saw the bill. $300 for 5 bikes for about 2 1/2 hours. Be careful. "
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/11/2016,"Stations Everywhere! I was in DC for work and wanted to cram in as much as I could in a very short period of time. Essentially, I did a self-led monument tour on bike, using the Capital Bikeshare program. It was really easy. I opted for the three day membership (I think this option was around 20 bucks) and then biked my heart out. So here is the deal, you get 30 minutes of each ride free. I downloaded one of the apps (I used D.C. Bikes) that shows you where all of the stations are. This handy app also has a timer that helps you remember when 30 minutes is almost up. So, when the timer hit 5 minutes or so, I looked for the closest station (using the app), docked the bike to return it, and then got another bike. If you make sure to return the bike before your free 30 minutes is up, you bike all over town for just the cost of the membership. A couple more pointers.. pick out your bike, adjust the seat, and know where you are going before you swipe your card. That way, you are ready to go and are not wasting time with all this while the clock is ticking. The bikes are a little heavy, but they get you where you are going. Happy biking!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/06/2016,Poor system They do not tell you that you need to dock the bikes every 30min so you will not be charged overages. I charged 92 dollars and there refund policy is only 50%of the charge will be returned if an error was found. Waited a week to find out this was their policy. Becareful!!!
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/02/2016,"Who reads reviews about bike rentals when visiting DC? YOU SHOULD! I didn't. That was a mistake on my part. Like everyone else, I thought that the $8 daily fee was reasonable. I didn't think that it would be a problem swapping out bikes. It was! If I were traveling by myself it wouldn't have been a problem. Traveling in a pair was a hassle; I wouldn't even think of traveling with a family or another couple. Like others have written, bikes aren't always available. Other times there aren't any docking stations. The kiosk display is difficult to read. At time you have to push the button extremely hard to get results. Who takes the time to read the 133 screen pages of the rental agreement? Bottom line: It was great breezing around town on the cruiser; however, I wouldn't do it again unless traveling alone. If you must rent these bikes, carefully dock the bike after use; wait for the GREEN light before you leave; don't wait until the last second to swap bikes and if you do follow the instructions to get your 15 minute credit. Customer service reduced my fees; don't take no for an answer if you are a first time user."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/30/2016,"Happy Bike Rental Until you get back home and get the REAL BILL! Many of the positive reviews would really be negative because they bill directly to the credit card and you don't see it until you get your credit card/debit statement! You think it's $8 a day, IT'S NOT! READ THE FINE PRINT (HARD TO DO IN THE SUN). You have to keep returning the bike every 30 minutes or you $$$$ increases. Sometimes the racks are full and you can't return them! Other times their system malfunction! IT'S TIME CAPITAL BIKE SHARE GETS THERE ACT TOGETHER AND STOP SCAMMING!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/29/2016,"Rip Off They make it seem like ""rent a bike for $8 a day"" but then they have all these ""time fees"" for having the bike out longer than a half an hour. That was annoying, but what was really disappointing was the fact that the dock wouldn't let me get the bike out. Then the light turned red, so I thought, like ANY normal human being, the when the bike was still stuck in the dock and the light was red that I could get a different bike, nope. So I left, well turns out they charged me an extra $30 dollars for time the bike was ""out of the dock"" and won't refund it. Would NOT recommend. Poor customer service and crappy systems."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/26/2016,"Great way to see a lot in a shorter amount of time My family and I used the Capital Bikeshare program to tour the memorials on the National Mall. Nothing is better than touring DC at the speed of a cruiser. We had a blast. At first I was nervous because the traffic is so bad, but then I noticed almost everyone is riding on the sidewalks. It's so much easier and more enjoyable than hiking up and down the mall. The only difficult part was returning the bikes when we were done. The bike rack nearest our condo only had one empty port. We returned one of our bikes there and then had to find another rack with open ports to return the other bikes."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/18/2016,"Do NOT use the bikes! SCAM!!!!!!!!! MISLEADING COST!!!!!!!! This seemed like a great way to get around Washington DC and there were docking stations in very convenient areas. We rented them under the assumption they were $8/day, which seemed reasonable, considering the bikes weren't in that great of shape anyway. The signs lead you to believe this is the true cost. If you don't dock the bikes every 30 minutes, it charges you by the minute and it's very expensive. We found docking stations but they were all full so we were not able to dock our bikes at all and had them out for 4 hours, resulting in the $8 PLUS over $60 in overage charges. I called to complain about the misleading nature of this and she said I should have read the sign better. Judging by the reviews on here, this seems to be a common error with people so perhaps this should be advertised better! I wouldn't ever use this bikeshare again. Total RIP OFF and SCAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/17/2016,"Capital bike share is a scam, tries to make money on your back and worse customer service ever! I am very upset.I payed 2 memberships of 3 days last weekend, so total 34 dollars,When we returned our bikes after our first trip, my mother had no problem, but me the station signaled a red light. I called immediately the customer service and the person after several advices to try to remove the bike and didn't workout, (she was pretending the problem was coming from their stations but from me!!! 5bikes at this ration were having red light!! She told me that a technician would come later to fix it. In the meantime, she told me I won't be charged for the extra time (because the system didn't consider that my bike was back) and I asked her several times to make sure there was no confusion, and I had hard time getting that answer!Then I was able to use the membership only on Sunday (because my membership was not working until someone fixed the bike!!) where my mother and I used it twice, one trip less than 30min and another one a little bit less than an hour. We had no issue during these 2 returns, the lights were green, and I was very careful for that after my first experience on Friday I can tell you!!!Today I have been charged of 34 dollars of membership + 78 dollars!!!!!So when I called at 7:30am today, the person told me that I used a bike once for 5 hours!!!!It's impossible. Who is lying? I wonder...The person told me that she was requesting a refund of 50% for that extra charge, but it's not fair I need a full refund of the 78dollars.And the fact that because of the first trip (when the light was red), my mother and I were not able to use the bike afterwards until the person came to fix it. So we were not able to enjoy fully the membership during the weekend, so I would also deserve a refund of a part of the membership ! I emailed the support, NO ANSWER!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/16/2016,"Huge Rip Off, 1st timers expect 100's of dollars in overage charges I took a group of students to visit DC, we eagerly rented the bikes $8-24 hours. Little did we know that if you don't check in every 30 min you will get huge overage charges. I had about $60 per bike (6 bikes total) On a teacher's salary...that sucks! They advertise the $8/24 hour part but not to check in and that's where they get your money. Save your money and rent else where! Never again"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/16/2016,Warning - be careful of this scam! If you do not dock the bike every thirty minutes you will be charged high fees. $62.00 for  a little over 4 hours.  So much for a relaxing bike ride when you have to watch the time every 30 minutes!
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/16/2016,"Loved it! Using this bikes in DC helped my trip be great! We used this bikes all the time for transportation. It was really fun! I did have a problem with docking one of the bikes, so I was overcharged. I called them and they fixed the problem fast and easily. They have a system to check for attempts to dock. Customer service was outstanding. This bikes are everywhere in DC, including the outside areas. Using the google maps app helped. Some times some stations would be all busy but for the most part there was another a couple of blocks away that was available. Their map online will show you availability."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/15/2016,"watch for the rate $$$ the bikes are everywhere... they are in great shape often new, easy to adjust. Beware of the $$ rate after 1 hour..keep you clock ticking every 30 minutes.. you can read more online on their site. I got confused so selected 1 fare ride...and just rode around for 5 hours...It is a plus if you want to see the mall, we truly enjoyed until the bill came.. oh well.. will research better next time"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/14/2016,"The worst customer service I have ever seen!!! Capital bikeshare has the worst customer service I have ever seen. I had a 3 day pass and could barely used it because their sistem works so bad that I was afraid of being charged large amounts in the credit card for nothing. We took 2 bikes, but it happend to us, twice in the same day, that only the first code allowed us to take a bike, the second one didnt work so the light went red and couldnt take the bike, but, and here is the most important: their sistem (and the customer service) insisted that both codes were fine and that we had both bikes, thats why they charged on my credit card ""$200"", yes two hundred dollars!!!! The worst thing was the treatment recieved by the people from customer service, who are supposed to help the customers but instesd of doing that they just keep insisting that I was crazy and that both codes were ok and that i should find the other bike (by a bar code thet have sticked on them) and but it back! (Not that easy when the bike never came out). Worst customer service ever!! Next time I will need a notary every time i take a bike so he can certified whenever it works bad!!! And believe me it happens a lot, found lots of people with the same problem as mine!!!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/08/2016,"Capital Bikeshare Steal $ from their Customers Where would you end up paying $172++ for renting 2 bikes for a day? With Capital Bikeshare... Any regular European would expect the rental to be around $8 for a day, for 1 bike. That seems like a fair and normal charge, right? Would you investigate further and could you ever conceive of being charged $172 on top of the regular rental? Well, watch out, because they can simply slap it on your creditcard. Just like that... So here is where it went wrong for us. We did not understand that we had to dock the bike every 30 minutes. A simple misunderstanding that Capital Bikeshare takes full advantage of. We could have easily docked the bikes, because we used the bike to visit all the tourist sights. However, we were totally unaware that this needed to be done in order to get honored the $8 a day fee. And so, upon leaving Washington, we were presented with a $172 fee. Capital Bikeshare explained us the reasoning behind it, and we explained to them that if we had known of their rules, we would have docked the bikes accordingly. Cut a long story short, they were ""kind"" enough to refund $86. That still left me feeling totally robbed by them though. Will never use them again, and strongly recommend to rent elsewhere, for a day rental. Make sure to research other rental companies, because this one takes full advantage of you not knowing the full rules."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/06/2016,"tooooo expensive 3 hours 30 dollars one bike All the times I rent bikes the longer u have it the cheaper it gets, not with these people, I paid $30.00 for one bike for 3 hours, the machine instructions are very confusing. read and read very carefully . Stay away from these bikes save your money in DC get UBER."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/04/2016,"Fun but expensive $124 for two bikes Unfortunately I doubt we will ever use a bike share company again, barring the prices drop significantly. At first glance this seems like such a fantastic idea and such an amazing way to see our nation's capital. Unfortunately it is extremely expensive, I could have bought two used bikes on Craigslist in the capital for what we ended up paying for the two bike rental. 2 bikes for roughly 4 hours, came to a total of $124.00. And I do wish they had a water bottle holder. Also my bike kept slipping out of gear. The price really ruins the experience."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/27/2016,"Bad experience We planned to see the sights using this scheme- after a vain attempt to get 3 bikes from one station we walked to another and managed. We used these for 40 minutes and then spent several hours at Arlington, getting the metro back to the city and then tried to get a further set of bikes. The kiosk informed us that we still had the bikes and so couldn't get anymore. A phone call to the help line established that 1 of the three had a problem with docking- but they could do nothing about it- we could either get back and sort the problem at the last the docking statiin ourselves or an engineer would look at it some time in the next 48 hrs. Meantime the charge was continuing. Not impressed with this as we have used the same system in London on many occasions with no problems. Will not try it again- we will hire bikes for the day as this is cheaper than the excess charges on this scheme"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/25/2016,"Lovely way to visit DC It's very easy to get one of the bikes from the docking stations, that are located almost all around the important areas of the city's downtown, although it's not clear how to get a new bike once you left your first bike and try to get a new one at a new station. There's also an app which I haven't tried, I imagine it'd be helpful to try it. The stations are also in spanish."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/22/2016,"Capital Bike Share needs to maintain their machines and not blame the customers I left a bike at Braddock Metro and properly locked it in. I checked it three times to make sure it was locked in. Customer service at first said that the bike could not be located. then they could see that it had been locked at the station but ""improperly so"". They said that they would have to send a technician out to see if it was still there. Their computers monitor these things and they could have sent a technician when it ""pinged"" as the lady called it. Better yet, they could check their stations to see if they are functioning when they move around the bikes each day."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/11/2016,"Great way to traverse the Mall, but be watchful of your time ! Capital Bikeshare is great, easy, and fun way to quickly zip around the National Mall taking in all the sights to see. My boyfriend and I took two bikes from the Jefferson Drive station - nearest the Washington Monument, and proceeded on a clockwise tour around the Tidal Basin taking in the Jefferson Memorial, George Mason Memorial, Tidal Basin sights and Cherry Trees, FDR Memorial, MLK Memorial, DC War Memorial, Lincoln Memorial, Reflecting Pool, Vietnam Memorial, 56 Signers of the Declaration and pool, the WWII Memorial, the White House, finally and Capitol Hill before riding our bikes back down the Hill past the Smithsonians and returning our bikes, ultimately back to the same original station on Jefferson Drive. Aggravatingly, between all those sights, there is only one station over between the FDR memorial and Lincoln memorial to park the bikes again and reset the 30 min free window of time. This makes it impossible to pay the $8 for a daily pass and maintain a free charge by staying under 30 mins, as there is simply not enough bike stations to check your bike back in, not to mention you'll find yourself easily spending at least 30 mins or more at each memorial if you really take your time to relax and take in the feeling of each sight. In the end, we were charged much more than we expected, but after doing the math it was the correct charge as advertised. In hind sight, I would do it again as riding the bikes sure did beat walking, (there is no way possible to cover that much ground on foot and not want to kill each other from exhaustion and aching feet), feeling the wind as you bike along, and laughing the whole way riding along made the entire experience on the Mall so much more enjoyable. Just be prepared to spend about $50 a person so you won't feel suckered when you see the charges appear on your card."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/11/2016,HORRRRRRIBLEEE SCAM ARTISTS Horrible HORRRRRRRRible service. they say you have a 24 hour membership and then charge you for ever hour after 30 minutes. even worse customer service!
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/10/2016,Be careful using your credit card  I had a great time biking for 2 days in DC and was happy with the capital bikeshare. But then I found out that I was charged $54 and the transaction happened when I was no longer in DC. I called the customer service and was informed that my credit card was used at a location that I have never been to. They cancelled the transaction and I have to wait for 7-10 business days. Please check your credit card transactions after using the card for the bikeshare. I hope this won't happen again to anyone else. 
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/09/2016,"Broken & Full return stations make this less fun We rented some bikes as an easy way to make it around to see the monuments in the mall and tidal basin area. We left from the Lincoln memorial where we easily rented two bikes. We rode around the basin and attempted to turn in our bikes by the Jefferson memorial only to find the station full. This shouldnt have been a big problem because you can get an extra 15 minutes if the station is full, but the kiosk was broken. So I called the number for help, and they were unable to provide us with an extra 15 minutes over the phone. Finally we rode back round to the Washington Monument and returned our bikes there. When we went to take out new bikes after touring the monument, we couldnt...not sure why, but it wouldnt let us take a new bike with our codes, so we gave up. I've done this in other cities without issue, not sure why this particular program was so rough."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/02/2016,"Great way to see all the sights! We used Capital Bikeshare for the two days we were in DC with our two teenagers, and it was a lifesaver, and so much fun! It allowed us to see all of the sights, more than once, without having to walk everywhere or take other transit. I see some people complaining about the lack of docking stations near the museums, or the cost being high, yet we didn't find either of these to be the case. The key is to read the instructions...you can do so ahead of time online at their website. There is also a free app you can download ahead of time to help you find the docking stations. We found stations near all the places we went (Lincoln memorial, Space museum, capital, our hotel, etc.). To use them the most economically...rent them for 24 hours or 3 days. Then, as long as each time you ride them it's 30 minutes or less until you check it back in to a docking station, there is no charge. So we just got the bike, rode to the next sight we wanted to see, checked the bike in, explored the sight, and then got another bike to ride to the next sight. If you lock it up, then you're going to be paying for all that time that you aren't using it...just find a station, dock it, and get another bike once you're done exploring the memorial or the museum. A couple of times we used the bike over 30 minutes (like when we rode to Arlington Cemetery), and it was just $2 more. THE KEY IS TO CHECK THE BIKE IN, EXPLORE, AND THEN GET ANOTHER BIKE. Our kids loved this, and we did, too. And doing this at night all around the mall to see the beautiful lights was the highlight of our trip. The paths are large, and easy to maneuver on the bikes. And even riding to our hotel or to a restaurant, as long as the sidewalks weren't super crowded, we could just ride on the sidewalks. The bikes have a bell on them, so you can alert walkers that you are approaching. This is the way to go in DC!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/01/2016,Scam! Do NOT give these criminals your money! Shame on them for their predatory pricing! Promised $8 a day but charged $102 on credit card and when questioned said that riders need to dock the bikes every 30 minutes not to incur extra fees. The cowards use a 3rd party customer service department and won't release their own phone number. The customer service company says they regularly give50% back on the fees but aren't authorized to give more. They count on people giving up. It is obvious that they charge so high to suck hundreds of dollars out of many people & still laugh while getting 50% from those of us that call them on their scam. Don't ride - RUN! Run away from these scam artists.
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/28/2016,Easy and cheap This was the first time I had ever used any type of biking system in a big city. The bikeshare was easy to understand and was actually a pretty cheap was of transportation. I loved the fact that you could just grab one and then return it to a location where you were going. The only downside is that sometimes the dock you want to return it to is full and you end up having to ride around to find another one. But we did download the app which helped us find all the docks. Its really a nice way to see the city if you prefer not to walk. 
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/25/2016,"perfect with teenagers We have 2 teens (16 and 17) and they just loved visiting the city on bike. We have done a lot of citytrips and this time for the first on bike. The weather was nice and the traffic (sunday) was ok. Tip: you can only rent 2 bikes on 1 creditcard. so make sure you have enough cards! Make sure you print a good map at home so you can find the docks!! (or if you have internetacces, download the app!) We didn't and had to search a lot. What we didn't like: a few times there were not enough bikes in the docks for the four of us. And sometimes a few bikes just didn't got out the dock."
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,04/24/2016,"Need more bikes, more docks GREAT idea, very convenient. But only if there are spare bikes where you wish to pick one up, and spare docks where you wish to end your journey. Can get expensive if you can't get to a dock within 30 mins of starting. Very tiring if there are no bikes left and you have to walk a long way to the next station. Otherwise a great option, cheaper than metro and enables you to see a lot more than you could on foot. "
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/24/2016,"Excellent and fun way to see the city My daughter and I were so glad when we figured out the 'deal' with the bikes and rented them for a evening trip to the monuments. It was one of the best memories of our trip. One thing about DC is that many attractions shut down after 5 and one doesn't always know what to do to occupy that time. We absolutely LOVED the bikes and we rode out to Jefferson Memorial which is hard to get to otherwise. I would have felt better having a bike lock to secure our bikes when we got to places, as I was afraid someone might steal or take our bike, so that might be a suggestion to bring along.....but it all worked out well and was a cheap and fun way to see the monuments."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/18/2016,"Impossible to dock the bike! This morning I lost an hour biking around in the hot sun trying to find an empty dock. I spent so much time that I missed an appointment. I went to 3 full bike thingies and met a guy who had also had 3 unsuccessful attempts in the opposite direction! I called the phone number on my printed receipt in tears because by this time I had to eat or would have a diabetic ""low"". Really ! You guys need to plan ahead or don't offer the bikes. Finally I went back to a bike location I had been to before, and a van was there taking bikes off the docks so we could dock our bikes. Worst bike share in DC!!!!"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/18/2016,"This is the way to get around the mall area We visited Washington DC the weekend of the Cherry Blossom parade. We have CoGo in Columbus, same bikes, same parent company and decided to commute by bike as much as possible. There are docking stations near just about every major and a few minor monuments. The station close the Lincoln had a long line of people wanting to get bikes and a long line of people checking them back in.As we use our local bike share all of the time we are familiar with the rules and how to make them work for you. Read the rules on the website or kiosk first. You don't want to end up getting charged more than you should.I only gave this one 4 stars and the one in Columbus I gave 5. That is because I rode 3 different bikes and all three needed some maintenance done to them."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/15/2016,Second best way to see the sights In town for conference. When got done for the day went and rented the bike. Used the 3 day rental. Can use it when and wherever you wanted for the three days.All you do is put in your credit card answer a couple of questions and remember your code. So much nicer than walking all over the city. Just use the bike lanes and be careful. Only thing was not having a bike lock... However nobody stole our bikes.Have Fun.
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/09/2016,"Freedom on Wheels I try to bike in every city that I visit but knowing the horrendous traffic quagmire that is DC I was a little reticent about biking in DC. That was until two days ago when I took Amtrak to DC and decided to give Capital Bikeshare a try. What a great experience. The bicycles are in great shape, the kiosks are easy to use, the response time from the kiosks is quick, and the kiosks are located in very convenient locations. I would suggest that bikeshare find a way to let riders tell the system what maintenance needs to be done to each bike ( a missing bell on one, a slipping second gear on another).I was very brave and road up Mass Ave all the way to 15th Street from the very convenient Union Station Bikeshare kiosk. No muss, no fuss. Parked at 21st and M, went for coffee and then picked up a new bike to travel back across town to 7th and F. Capitol Bikeshare has a great website that makes it very easy to find where kiosks are located, if there are slots available at the kiosk of choice, and helps you plan your trips. I think that from now on when I am in DC I will skip the Metro, bus and cabs - I will use Capitol Bikeshare and have freedom from waiting in underground caverns for crowded subway cars, paying for parking in lots, and searching for elusive parking spaces.Next time you are in DC, give Capital Bikeshare a try. You won't be disappointed."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/09/2016,"Rented it for 3 days My son realty wanted to ride a bike around the city instead of doing the standard tours. Ended up being a lot of fun. You pay for a 1 day or 3 day membership and then you pay by the hour or half day or whole day. You can download an app to find the nearest bike stand so you can dock it and not be charged while you are touring things. Only issue is there are no bike stands on the mall. So if you are going museum to museum you need to lock it to something. If you are seeing this review before you go to DC then bring a bike lock so you can lock it up. We had to skip the museums as I did not feel comfortable leaving the bikes without a lock while we toured. We did ride them from our hotel on H street all the way to the White House, Washington Monument, on to WWII Memorial, Lincoln Memorial and then to the Zoo. There is a wonderful bike path to the zoo I highly recommend it. We did dock the bikes in front of the zoo and took the Metro home. "
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/04/2016,"Good that they exist, bad that they are overpiced and unsafe Washington D.C. is not a city to ride a bike. The traffic is heavy, and the bike lanes are not safe (if they exist). Even if you decide to hire this bike, be aware that it costs 8 dollars for a day enrolment fee and then - it is free only first 30 minutes, then it is 2 dollars for the next 29 minutes and even more for the time to follow. With the Washington D.C. distances this means you have to pay constantly extra fees. Besides, if you are a tourist, it is always uneasy to find a bike stand (if you do not have mobile with the internet connection with you). It seems that these bike stands are deliberately hidden on the back streets, so you loose time just for looking for them and pay extra. And there are not enough of these stands. You can easily arrive with your bike and find no free slot to park it. Overall impression - Capital Bikeshare wants to earn money on you without thinking about your convenience and safety. In comparison to Vienna city bikes, for example, this provides bad impression. Not a single stand near National Gallery, or Space museum, of Natural History Museum, the most popular places. You have to make circles and circles in order to find a bike stand on the back side of the Orangery (not the most obvious place!) and to walk from there."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,03/30/2016,"Spontaneous Self-Guided Evening Monument Tour Streets and paths are too congested over Spring Break to ride bikes during the day. We took an evening bike tour as a family and it was a highlight! After endless walking and weary feet, we covered a lot of ground and enjoyed seeing the city lit up at night. Evening monument tours were sold out but this was still fabulous and much cheaper. Just know where the stations are to dock near the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Memorial when you want to take a closer look. Read other reviews to understand the pricing system first. "
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,03/21/2016,"Horried Customer Service Be warned, their customer service will not help in any issue. Be sure you use a credit card that will accept and process a chargeback since their customer service dept. is incapable of assisting. Buy a nicer pair of shoes, take a cab or the Metro."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,01/16/2016,"Bring your own helmet The rental bikes provided my family a convenient & inexpensive way to get around. We were able to get to all of the museums & monuments quickly on our own schedules. My only complaint is that there were no helmets to be found anywhere in all of Washington! Any real cyclist knows that people who ride without helmets are referred to as ODs (organ donors). As a nurse, I did not feel comfortable allowing my family to ride in the streets without helmets. Fortunately, the locals did not seem to mind us riding on the sidewalks (still not safe, but better than riding in traffic)."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/29/2015,"Great system for getting around So for 8 bucks, you get unlimited 30 minute trips for a day. There are so many bike share stations around the popular landmarks, you can't go wrong with this. We were able to basically see all the monuments and memorials in one day thanks to grabbing a bike and riding around. A great system."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/28/2015,"Great way to get around I love how bike friendly DC is! They have biker paths everywhere and lots of stations with the bike share program so pretty much anywhere you are going within the area a station is close by. Its $8 fee for the day. Then you can use the bike for 30 minutes for free, once you put back in bike station the time is stopped. I think its about $2 for each additional 30 mins you have it out, but you could easily stop at a close station check in and check back out to keep the free time going. It was a great way for us to get around and tour museums/monuments "
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,10/23/2015,"good but... more expensive than it might seem At first this looks like a good - and fair - deal - you rent a bike for 1.5 hours for $16. But this is just a teaser - every 30' extra will set you off another $8. Thus, this service is best if you plan to have several trips of limited duration, but with total time <90 min. I really do not see the reason why they would need to set such extortionate prices. Then of course there are the unpredictable snafus... you trying to park the car late at night just aching to go to sleep and find all slots are taken; so wearily off to find another parking slot God knows how far away. I'd recommend for short distances in an area with many bike slots and parking spaces. Otherwise - the company will bleed you dry. "
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/19/2015,"Visiting Memorials the Easy Way We had walked the National Mall, Grey line toured and done the hop on hop off to visit the monuments and memorials but nothing has beat the bikeshare ride. My husband's knees are bad and I'' jus plain out of shape so when we decided to take our grandson to Washington over fall break we weren't sure how we would visit everything that he wanted to see. We got off the metro at the Smithonian stop, rented the bikes and off we went. We were able to visit everything and ride over to the White House. Most of this area is flat or a very genial slope which seemed to be downhill both ways!The app isn't GPS enabled so we had to do a little searching for the kiosk and is not entirely accurate on the availability for returns. We did the daily rate and kept the bikes for the entire time. If you were wise and returned them every 30 minutes the 8.00 daily fee is all you would pay."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/23/2015,"A great way to see DC What a great concept - bike on demand! I used it extensively during my extended weekend visit, accompanying two locals with ""real"" bikes. Even though these bikes are built like tanks and only 3 speeds, I was able to keep up and felt pretty comfortable (beware of chafing after riding too much though). The lights are mostly for being seen, rather than seeing, so be careful riding at night. I found out the hard way that the service is only available in the District, as my ride across the bridges to Virginia ran up a hefty fine for a late check-in. I see from other reviews that there are stations in Maryland, so that helps. Seeing the city by bike was much more fun than driving, especially once I understood which streets were bike-friendly."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/20/2015,"Worth a try but know how the system works! First lets start off that people need to understand how this system works. Most of the complaints here are because they do not read or understand how the bikeshare works. Do people really think they are getting a bike for $8.00 a day and that is it? It is a membership and if you go over 30 minutes without checking in the bike there will be extra charges.Do keep in mind there will be bike stations that have no bikes or there are no docks. There will be bike that do not work and docks that are broken.You want to make sure if you are riding and pass a bike station to check the bike in,. You can not be sure your destination station will have empty slots. You can get 15 minutes extra time if there is no slots to drop the bike. However you need to know where the next station is. That may also be full. There are maps of the locations at the stations but there is no place at the station that you can check the status. There are apps available for cell phones but they are not that reliable. They are not always up to date or the app does not work. The Capital Bikeshare app it has for itself never worked. Try Spotcycle or others.We had two bikes and rode about 15 miles over the two days and 2 1/2 hours hours of use, It was easy to check in the bike and get the same bike out again. There we a few spots there were no empty slots. What we did if there was only one slot was to check in one bike, get it out again and check in the other bike and get that out again. That we we got another 30 minutes until we could find an open station. One time we had to go to 3 stations before we could return both bikes together. One time we had to check-in and leave one bike and then go drop the the other bike at the coral bike station at 13th and New York Ave then walk backKeep in mind commuters ride the bikes to downtown to work and take them back near their home. We found walking and riding around that most of the bike stations where full around the downtown area and the museums.during the day with people waiting for an empty slot to open up.We used the bike system for 2 days and had a day key card for convenience. We could have got a day membership or 3 day membership but then you have to use a code each time. There is also the question of the deposit charged for each bike. I never got a clear answer from customer service on this. We were not charged a deposit with the day key card.There is also a problem with Capital Bikeshare answering e-mails. They don't respond. Not once did they respond to any e-mails I sent in weeks prior to the trip. I ended up calling most times.. I also brought it to there attention of the negative reviews here and other sites that they should address. They did not seem to care.Still we wanted to give this a try. It worked out fine even with the hassle of finding a open bike station to drop a bike. The bikes are nice and study and easy to use.Give it a try but know how it works!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/11/2015,"Convenient, cheap and healthy I use these whenever I vist DC. Fantastic way to get around the city. Stations all over the place - google maps can help you find nearest stations and if you look at the colour of the marker you can see whether there are empty docking stations, bikes available etc.. Use your overseas credit card with confidence - I'm always surprised at just how cheap it is, even with the crappy conversion back to AUS dollars. The bikes are comfortable, easy to ride, have convenient storage straps at the front to carry yor gear. Highly recommended"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/03/2015,"Great Way to See the D.C. Region and Get Fit Capital Bikeshare has over 350 stations with 3,000 bikes. There's no better way to see D.C., Arlington, Alexandria, and Montgomery County than by bike. There are stations along the National Mall and Iwo Jima in Arlington, exciting neighborhoods with restaurants and nightlife, and at Metro stations. You can buy a 24-hour or 3-day membership and then each trip under 30 minutes during your membership period is included in the membership price. If your trip extends beyond 30 minutes, there are additional usage fees of $2 for 30 - 59 minutes, $6 for 60 - 89 minutes, etc. Familiarize yourself with the pricing at: https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/pricing/ . Keep your trips under 30 minutes and the membership fee is all you pay.This isn't bike rental, it's bike transit and designed for short transit trips. Use the bike while you need it. Return it once you don't need it anymore. If you want a leisurely bike ride for the day, rent a bike. There are so many stations that Capital Bikeshare can get you where you need to go. Here's the station map: https://secure.capitalbikeshare.com/map/ .Enjoy!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/23/2015,"Great way to see the city.  First understand the way they charge. You sign up for a day, but if your trip takes longer than 30 minutes you have to pay additional. But you can take as many 30 minutes or less trips a day for the $8Make sure that you download Spotcycle app to find the bike racks. I found lots of bikes but the app was the best way to find open slots to return the bikes. Great way to get around downtown DC"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/18/2015,"BEWARE! RUN, RUN, RUN as fast as you can AWAY FROM THIS SERVICE. BEWARE! If I could give fewer stars I would. RUN, RUN, RUN as fast as you can AWAY FROM THIS SERVICE. If you are determined to go through with your rental from Capital Bikeshare, then take the 30 minutes at the kiosk while people are waiting behind you to rent a bike and READ THE NUMEROUS PAGES OF FINE PRINT on that tiny screen! Your 24-hour rental for which you think you are paying $8 when you select that option on the screen is NOT $8. You are actually renting the bike for 30 minutes! The 24 hours is simply the amount of time your access code will be valid. If you keep that bike longer than 30 minutes you're going to rack up some hefty ""overtime"" charges. Apparently, that bit of information is buried in the fine print. Very misleading, in my humble opinion. I will NOT be using this service again!"
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/05/2015,"Too many glitches for a large family We are a family of 6. This is prob a great service for two people to take advantage of but MAJOR flaws for a family with 4 kids! We started the rental process which is rather cumbersome and takes several minutes per bike. We only wanted to go from the Lincoln Memorial to the Holocaust museum so seemed easy enough. We got two bikes out (clock starts running on rental time as soon as that first leaves the docking station) and discovered the following:- We discovered the hard way that you can only rent TWO bikes per credit card ACCOUNT. Although we had four credit cards between us, we could only rent 4 bikes because they were linked to only two accounts. (our other Visa number was stolen at the start of our trip and that account was shut down). The machine spit out ticket codes and it took quite awhile for us to realize it was simply reissuing the rental code numbers that didn't work. After we gave up and I RAN the entire way in 98 degrees trying to keep up with my kids on their bikes, my husband realized it was just Reissuing the codes that my daughters had already used to release their bikes. By the time we rented the first four bikes, and gave up on the last two, we were probably already 15 minutes into our rental period. When we got to the docking station nearest the Holocaust museum, there weren't enough open slots to dock the four bikes.... so we needed to find another location a few blocks past our destination, return the bikes there, and then come back on foot. (Our kids are 16, 14, 12, & 10.... the 10 year old just barely was able to reach the pedals with the seat lowered all the way. There are no helmets so bring your own)"
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,08/04/2015,"As long as you understand the rules its a great way to see DC. We have bike share in my city so I was aware of the 30 minute rule and we planned our routes accordingly. I don't remember how easy to understand the rules posted on the signs. I remember noticing it was 200 deposit per bike so I am guessing there were more rules on display. Dont let the bad reviews scare you. Its not a scam but you have to work the rules. DC is a great biking city. I found it very safe and easy to get around. There were a few times we noticed that the preferred location for drop off or pick up was going to be full/empty so double check the website before and plan your route for your best experience. The reason for my 3 star review had to do with the pay machines. At my height, with the sun glaring and then again when it was dark out, I could not read the displays. Also the computer prompts did not work very well."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/15/2015,"PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS It seems a lot of the unhappy reviews revolve around misreading (or ignoring) the 30-minute rule with the bikes and therefore paying a hefty overage fee… and DANG yeah it can get pricey. But if you stick to the rules… $8 for a full 24 hours is an awesome deal! Between that and the metro there was never a need for my tourist self to get a car.THERE’S STATIONS EVERYWEHREEspecially in the tourists areas—there’s like a bike station a short walk from every memorial. Getting the station’s app is very helpful because it not only shows station locations, but they show how many bikes are available as well as how many places to return your bike (We had trouble in some less visited areas because the bike racks were totally full and we had to double back and return our bikes elsewhere)BIG AND BULKY BIKESI’m a petite lady who rides a road bike. It took me a few minutes to get used to these—as cruisers they just seemed HUGE plus I never got fully used to the wide placement of the handlebars. But once moving I never had problems with the bike itself."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/13/2015,"Awesomely convenient This is the best way to see DC. Stations are numerous and easy to manage. Much cheaper than taxi or uber. $8 for 24 hour rental! DC is flat with many bike lanes. Ride the mall, monuments, museums. Download Spotcycle app. It's a game changer. Tells you where nearest stations are and how many bikes are at each station. And it's not just DC. Worldwide. "
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,07/12/2015,"Good for short commuting A convenient way to get around the city, but do it in 30 minute bites! The first 30 mins is ""free"" then it adds $2 for next 2 hours.etc. the bikes are heavy and cumbersome- so if you like road bike, it is a cruiser! They have 3 gears, but rarely need to change around Washington.Limited locations, so may need to Plan a jog to nearest "
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/08/2015,"charged us 16 dollars plus 44 dollars for 2 hours of 2 bikes Capital Bikeshare, you really should think about improving the interface if 4 people that were there didn't realize that we were going to be charged 44 dollars of extra fees for renting 2 bicycles for 2 hours if we didn't dock the bikes each 30 mins, what sounds a bit like a cover ‎fraud for some of us."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/06/2015,"Fun and easy but can get expensive if you're not careful. We used these bikes to get around DC for two days for a total cost of $22 each. They cost $8 per day, and the first 30 minutes of usage is free; after that, the per hour charges can get pretty steep. They can be checked out as many times as you want during a 24 hour period. We made a game of figuring out how to get from here to there in less than 30 minutes, and if we couldn't, we found a docking station, turned in the bikes, and checked them right back out. On a hot day, it sure beat walking."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/06/2015,"Usurious usage fees! Not 8 dollars. Charged me 78 dollars for a 5.5 hour bike rental. Totally misleading fine print. As the lady on the phone told me this is a bike Sharing program not a bike rental program. The first 30 minutes are free (or included in the 8 dollar full day rental) Check it in every 30 minutes and you wont be charged beyond that 8 bucks. Hence the name share. If you go longer than that prepare to open a vein and pay in green hulk blood. 5.5 hours cost me 78 bucks? Seriously? I called into my credit card to dispute it and they did a three way call with me to Capital Bike share who said as a courtesy they could remove half the initial 70 dollar charge so they gave me back 35 bucks. I was going to leave it at that as a lesson learned in capital nonsense when the lady got rude with me and said, sorry I couldn't read the fine print on the kiosk or in the prompts. (14 pages) of it. I told her. Hey, Im no dummy.. Lots of others complaining about this on trip advisor. I just didn't see it until it was too late and your fine print is clearly misleading. She continued being snippy so I said I wont be using you ever again and now Im going to leave some negative social media complaints. I cant run a business like they are and they should not be allowed too either. For what it is, 30 minute bike sharing, for 8 bucks a day its an overpriced service. For what it allows. Bike rentals for 15 bucks an hour its a total loss. Stay away."
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/06/2015,"No bike parking near smithsonian  I just spent a half hour riding around the smithsonian trying to find an open spot to park the bike.They are all full. I missed the chance to see the museum, but did get to see grumpy tourists act like bike gangs as they couldn't park either "
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/02/2015,"Misleading prices So this morning I was charged $62 by capital bike share and I was very upset about that. I was upset because I rented bikes yesterday for me and my friend for 24 hours which was supposed to only be $16. So this morning I called customer service number about the charge and the lady said I was charged $62 because apparently we are supposed to return them every 30 minutes or they would charge fees. First of all I would like to say when we rented the bikes we didn't see that rule ANYWHERE!!! Second of all, I don't think that's a smart rule to have because why should people have to check-in the bike every 30 minutes when most people get it for an all day bike ride. People should not have to worry about finding a capital bike dock station and worry about getting charged if they don't check-in on time. I genuinely feel I’ve been wronged/scammed because again I did not see that rule anywhere on the screen when I was renting the bikes and neither did my friend. And I know they do that on purpose to make more money, mostly targeting tourists. But THIS NEEDS TO STOP NOW!!! Im seeing more and more people complaining about this problem. They need to understand that scamming people WILL NOT help their business in the long-run. So I STRONGLY don't recommend using bikeshare."
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/25/2015,"Not the greatest experience In one weekend had the extremes of experiences with Capital Bikeshare. One day of rental was fun and we got the hang of returning the bikes every 30mins. Although be prepared to find full bike stations that you have to use the app and be racing to find a location before you get an extra charge. The next day we decided to rent again, biked over to the Botanical Gardens, came out and couldn't check out 2 bikes. Calling customer service told us one bike was still checked out, we had checked both in and got the green light when docking. Since we now couldn't get 2 bikes we had to walk back across town to our hotel and were in poor spirits now that a bike was in our name that we didn't have. Customer service told me they would call me with updates, they never did, I called every hour with minimal updates, had to leave DC not knowing the resolution to the issue. Thankfully bike was returned and they did credit day of rental to me. Although half of my weekend to DC was ruined and their customer service needs significant improvement in how they talk with customers and choice of phrasing in email communications. The right thing to do would have been to let me rent out a 2nd bike so we could have enjoyed the rest of our Sunday. I have since asked around and will use Bike and Roll the next time I return to DC. Never Capital Bikeshare again, not worth it."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/24/2015,"Outrageous usage fees, intentionally misleading pricing I’m echoing what others have said, which is that this is kind of a scam. The way the website is laid out seems to be intentionally misleading, stating “Membership and Usage Fees”, with a chart below that clearly shows “24 hour $8”, “3 Day $17”, etc. but you have to scroll down to see that usage fees are listed - and charged - separately. I had the bike for 3 hours and was charged the $8 at the terminal, and then got hit with a $38 charge later on my card. When I called them I was told you have to re-dock the bike every 30 minutes to avoid the fees. We were in DC as tourists and thought the bikes would be a great way to see the memorials, and when we were done we couldn’t find a station with 2 open spots so I had to go a mile out of our way to find somewhere to drop mine. But this was all too bad for me, as the supervisor, Bud, told me. He was clearly unconcerned with my plight and reduced the charge somewhat, but not entirely. In doing some further research I’ve also found that the company has received $16 million in government subsidies as it is supposed to be helping low-income people commute and maintain employment. Good luck with that with the fees they charge! There’s no way anyone on a tight budget could handle these, and the company is clearly looking to make a big, fat profit off anybody who doesn’t read and understand the convoluted rules – while also taking our tax payer dollars. Really, really disappointing."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/22/2015,"Simple, Straightforward & A Great Way To See The City. We had walked around all morning and visited so many sights, we eventually decided to give these bikes a go; we started somewhere near Capitol Hill and ended near of our hotel near Dupont Circle. The bikes are inexpensive to use and it's really simple - there are bays everywhere, so you needn't worry about dropping them off or starting a new rental. The bikes are also good quality and I had no problems riding them in traffic or on walk ways. These are a great way to get around the city. **Happy to answer questions**"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/15/2015,"great method to get around and easy to use. My husband and I rented bikes when leaving the National's game one night as the Metro was swamped with people.Easy to find pick up spots and drop off stations. And plenty of locations as well.The first 30 minutes is free, so if you really want to beat the system, you can find a bike station at 25 minutes, check the bike in and then get a new code to take it out again right away"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/13/2015,"Conveniant Capital bikeshare is a conveniant way of getting around in Washington. The only trick is to find the bike stations and get to the next station in time to avoid a penalty. This can be a chalenge with the multiple - mostly red - traffic lights in DC. We had to problems. No bikes at Jefferson and no station at Arlington (this is a shame, for such an important monument - Rosslyn is to far away)."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/12/2015,"Excellent way to move around the city of keep fit while enjoying Washington DC Being in washington DC for a business meeting, it was excellent to have the possibility to rent a bike and explore Washington DC bike trails.
It is something all big cities should do."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/11/2015,"The best way to see the monuments is by bike! Saves your legs and time. The red bikes are available through out the city. You can use the website or APP to find your nearest back rack and availability. This is a nice feature during rush hour as bikes go quick. We used the bikes as tourist, but they are also used by the residents. Bikes located in popular areas go quick. Not to worry as another rack of bikes is usually on a few blocks away. You can return bike to any bike rack.We used the bikes on two different occasions. One day we toured the Mall, and Monuments: Washington, WWII, Vietnam, Korean, Lincoln, FDR, and Jefferson. It was nice to not walk, not have to park a car, and just leisurely ride around.Save your legs. Who wants to walk after being in a museum? Worth the price."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/08/2015,"Cheaper if you BOUGHT a bike Those red bikes look so great and we rented them and zipped all around on them for two days and it was a lot of fun. We loved riding our bikes to the Capitol, all around the monuments. Problem is they hook you on the $8 a day idea, and they are NOT $8.00 a day. So yeah, it's very deceptive and misleading and not an honest way to do business. But hey those red bikes are awesome. Just prepare yourself for major sticker shock when you look at your credit card -- I actually could have bought a new bike for what I paid Capital Bikeshare for renting for two days. Major bummer."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/04/2015,"Got me everywhere I got the three day plan for $17 and it was money well spent. These bikes got me everywhere I wanted to go.The bikes can be taken out for 1/2 hour at a time - they aren't intended for long-term rentals - but 1/2 hour was usually all I needed to get where I wanted to go. A couple of times I returned a bike, waited a few minutes, and took out another one for the next leg of my trip.I covered so much ground during a 3 day trip to DC!"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/04/2015,"Awesome I had a few hours to kill before a business conference on a Sunday afternoon. The Weather was beautiful. Easy to access. Roads within DC around the mall and ellipse and Capitol were all bike friendly and traffic was light and even some dedicated bike lanes. Reasonably priced, great exercise and it allowed me to see many more sights than just taking a taxi or metro. I would highly recommend taking the bike and I am not in great shape or a regular biker. "
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/27/2015,"Fun way to get around We used Capital Bikeshare after walking the Mall and wanting an easy, fun way to get around the rest of the city. I quick downloaded the app and found some bikes. Some people at the station had trouble with their codes (you get a code when you pay for your bike that you enter to get the bike out) but we didn't have any issues. Beware that the pay stations are extremely slow. You have to push a button, wait for it to register, push the next. That was the only issue we had and had a lot of fun biking around. Highly recommend!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/25/2015,"We loved it.... Just be aware of the rules  We really enjoyed the bike share. We used it to hop off and on, to get to different points all around the city. You do need to be mindful of the time, as the cost is $8/ day, then charged by the half hour for use. The first 30 min is free, but if you keep it longer than that, the charges add up fast. It is meant to be taken out, ridden somewhere and docked within 30 min. It is $2/30 min after that. If you want to bike more, sign it out again and you get another 30 min free to go somewhere else..... So just remember to dock it every 30 min, as you go from site to site,memorial to museum. It really is very convenient. There is even an app that will tell you how many bikes are available at any given location. A couple other points- only 2 bikes are allowed per credit card, so for our family of four we needed 2 credit cards. Also, if there is a red light on the bike in the dock, it means it is broken and can't be signed out. Bottom line- use it as to and from transportation, dock it while you are in places, and enjoy!! If you want a bike for the whole day, rent from a store, not from this commuter service! "
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/21/2015,Horrible!! There is no transparency in their business practices...I rented two bikes (advertised as 7 dollars a day) and got charged over $160 dollars for this..the shady part is that this wasn't even placed on one transaction...they charged me the larger sum several days later!! Never using capital bike share again...
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/18/2015,"Fun way to get around DC! These are awesome bikes. I'd say better maintained than when I had my own bike - because unlike my bike - these bikes get proper maintenance work done by bike professionals constantly. Looking up your route in advance or on a smartphone can help, especially if your destination might have a full rack. I hope the BikeShare expands with more stations and DC gets even better biking infrastructure."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/08/2015,"Perfect way to see the sites in DC As there is no metro coverage in the mall and other memorial site areas a must is to rent bikes--there are rental spots all over town where you pay one first price then can ride for 30 minutes at no extra charge--works great to just keep swapping them out as you go from site to site along the mall and around town. We used it back to hotel as well. Kids do fine on them. Very sturdy if a bit heavy bikes but most of DC fairly flat so no big deal. We did not have helmets and had no prob with that. We used bikes for a couple days working through the memorials etc, then used Metro for longer hops on different days. The bike stations really are all over the place so assuming you have a map or smart phone it is quite easy to hit them before your 30 minutes runs out or don't sweat it if you miss as the price is not much. Service is good if you have a technical glitch--just call and they can reset or tell you what to do. 2 bikes per credit card so families need more than one card."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/04/2015,WARNING - worst scam ever I purchased a one day permit for renting a bike on two separate days. At the terminal the small screen showed 138 pages of terms of condition difficult to read and somewhere in this text the Company claims the bike has to be docked every 30 min to avoid a late fee. I didn't see it or maybe the sun blocked my view at the scren. This has resulted in a late fee of 94 dollars per day as I rented a bike 2 separate days. I rented in the morning and biked around for 5-6 hrs. My receipts clearly states the use is for more than 30 min and paid for 24 hrs use and NOT that I HAVE to dock every 30 min. My 2 day bike rental amounted to 202 dollars and I am shocked this Company still can get away with it. I will definately contact the Tourist Authorities and warn (hopefully put pressure) about this company's business methods.
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/29/2015,"Scam Horrible experience. Very disappointing. The ads at the kiosk makes you believe they only charge $7 a day. We rented 2 bikes for 3 hours and ended up with $80 credit card charge. The rental agreement on the tiny LED screen is totally misleading. If the service program was backed by the government, then it's the shame of the governmentDON NOT SWIPE YOUR CREDIT CARD!!!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/22/2015,"Nice ride This is a great idea! We walked around our first afternoon here and by the time we got back to our lodging we were bushed.Today we decided to go w/a 3 day membership and take these bikes around the Capitol......... Easier on the legs and I love to bike, so even better! You can leave the bike at any of the many Capitol Bike stands, go into a museum, then come out and rent it again for just a few bucks.... Like I said...... Great Idea! "
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/21/2015,"Cheap Easy Way to Travel. Give your tired feet a break! Pros: I love this program. You can rent up to 2 bikes per credit card. Pick up at one location and drop off at any other location (which there are a lot of around DC). It was a lifesaver for us today. We were able to see all of the Tidal Basin, Monuments, and most of the National Mall this afternoon, after the museums closed (at 5 p.m.). They come with a little bell that you can ring and people will move over for you; and a carry area in the front that you can place your stuff in. You get a code after you pay that you type in and unlock the bike. Then, when you're done, you just shove it back into place and wait for the green light....and you're done.A 1 Day, 3 Day, Month, & Year passes are available. The first 30 min are free then there is a fee after that. All the fee information can be found at: https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/Con: Helmets are not available to rent. No bike locks available. *** This is much better than some of the other rental options (like Bike & Roll DC) which charge much more; and have more stringent return requirements (like your bike has to be returned by 6 pm when they close)."
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,04/20/2015,"Not a scam-Read the pricing web page. As I said, this is not a scam. All the reviewers saying this is a scam must have misunderstood, or ignored the pricing guidelines on the website. The pricing can be a bit tricky to follow, and they definitely try to hide the fact that there is a deposit per bike of about $100, but it's there, you just need to read, and you will see it.The bikes were in good shape, the pricing is good, and there were plenty of bikes, and bike docks around the city. I am only taking a point off because my wife and I did run across a bike dock that was full, and we found no simple directions to redeem an extra 15 minutes for finding another bike dock, as stated in the website, so we ended up going into the next half hour because of this.The other star I'm taking off is for the complete lack of either a mobile app, or least somewhat mobile-friendly site. The station map on the Capital Bikeshare website is darn near impossible to use on a smart phone!! The map squishes up into a tiny little part of the screen that is very difficult to use.Overall, it was a good experience."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/19/2015,"Best $7 you'll spend in DC! If you want to view as many monuments as possible in a day you best bet is to rent a bike from Capital Bikeshare. We wife and I had only a half day to spend in the mall. We took the bikes and we able to get great pictures of the Capital, Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, the Whitehouse and still had time to go to the Smithsonian before it closed."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/14/2015,"stay away from this thiefs!!!!!! we rented two bikes for 7 dollars an hour, and they charge my credit car with $94 dollars late fee for 2 hours later,   They make you think is cheap but the trick is lletting you take it for half hour free ."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/11/2015,"Best thing we did in DC to save time/Money/Energy!!!! A Must!!!! My son and I did a 3 day member rental at $15pp after we walked 10miles in one day and were exhausted. Your 1st 1/2 hour is free each time you rent a bike and then it is about $2 pp. for each 1/2 hr. after that. All you do to avoid the extra fee is ride less than 1/2 hour, dock the bike then re-rent. You get another fresh free 1/2 hour. According to the Bike share website 96% of DC members don't go over a 1/2 hr. ride. They have bike share stations all over the tourist area, the mall, downtown, Chinatown, etc. You can even rent them in Arlington. I would definitely recommend using the spot cycle app or capital bike share app because it lets you know how many bikes are available (or not available) at each station and where the stations are at. They are 3 speed, wide tire, wide seat mountain bikes with quick release seats and front and back automatic lights. DC's bike routes and paths are very easy to access and work great to avoid all the crowds walking on the sidewalks. I would highly recommend this to a family with teens and would definitely do this again when I return to DC."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/05/2015,"Ride around the National Mall and see all the monuments! This is a great idea: Bikes can be rented from any of numerous stands, and then returned to any stand when you are finished. It is a very easy process: Pay with a credit card, take out a bike, and then return it. We rented three 3-speed bikes with good sized, comfortable, adjustable seats that were in fine condition. It is a perfect way to get around to see all of the monuments without having to walk.There are two downsides, however, so be prepared. One is unavoidable: the crowds. You will likely have to weave your way through plenty of people, most of whom seem oblivious to bikes. Thankfully, they ""kind of"" move aside when they hear the bell, which is thoughtfully provided on each bike. Second, be very aware of the pricing. The company claims that the first 30 minutes is ""free,"" but that isn't really the case, since you have to pay a ""daily membership"" fee plus fees for each half hour. A two hour rental cost $20, and you can easily eat up two hours just riding around the Mall.Still, this is a wonderful alternative to walking and it is especially welcome on a sunny warm day!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/02/2015,Convenient and fun Save your feet while touring DC! We'd been here a few days and our feet were tired. We found out about Capital Bikeshare and decided to give it a try. We bought the 24-hour membership and it worked great. We took out bikes 3 different times during the day to go between attractions around the mall. The system worked well. The bikes were comfortable and in good repair. Will use this again.
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,02/18/2015,"BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT THEY CHARGE YOU! We rented 2 bikes for 24 hours and rate was 14usd(7 each), this amount was properly charged in my debit card , but 2 days later a second amount was charded: total of 60usd. I already report this to customer service and still waiting response.It's a good way to sightseeing city but they charge you whatever they want. So, BE VERY CAREFUL!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,01/10/2015,"The best way to see the city!!! We decided to rent a bike by chance and turned out to be one of the best and funniest ways to visit the city! Washington is very flat and there are several bike lanes, and also there several stations all around the city!You just have to check the fares, and is cheaper to return the bike every half an hour."
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,10/28/2014,"Nice to ride, but can't drop it off Too often I found stations that were full, some was unable to return my bike.  Also, the brakes on every single bike were weak.  And how about some maps to carry around? Not everyone wants to be limited to smartphone apps."
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/27/2014,Love/Hate relationship! The bikes were amazing. Wish you could have had more time to ride though. They were helpful to get around on. Sometimes there weren't enough bikes or parking places so you either wouldn't get a bike or you would get charged extra. During the morning many computers had low batteries so you couldn't rent. After walking to 2 stations that wouldn't work I called and our 24 hours was extended for free...hopefully...haven't gotten the credit card bill yet. The app is crucial to finding out how many bikes are available in a certain location. We ended up near the White House with no bikes available in the area so had to take the metro back to Union Station.
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,10/15/2014,Ripped OFF Read The Rules OR PAy$$$$$$ So 5 of us rented 5 bikes in DC read the rules as $7 a day rode to half a dozen sites returned the the bikes near our hotel 3-4 hours later one month has passed called to ask why $106 charge on my card for 2 of the bikes (you can only put 2 on a card so other people in party had same charges) and they responded by saying $7 per day for 1/2 hour trips for 24 hour period overtime charges will apply after 30 min. I got charged $46 overtime & $7 per bike for 3-4 hours of sight seeing. If I was aware up front maybe I would have still rented it but non of the 5 of us realized the conditions. I feel ripped off hoodwinked they got us for $230 overtime charges on 5 bikes for less than half day.
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/14/2014,Great way to be quick!  We only had a little time so we rented the bikes. We just wanted to see as much as we could. They saved so much walking! They were fun also. There are docking stations everywhere. I read on the reviews there is an app. I would recommend it. Can be a little hard finding the stations. We just did it today so I don't have any info on the money hold. I think it's worth it though!!! They could put a little more info on the signs so your not figuring it out on screen where you pay. They also may want to add another pay station at the busier ones!
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/11/2014,"Idiots Among US DON'T DO IT!!! Minimal cost if 7$ for 30min and your card gets charged a deposit fee of 101$ which stays on your card for up to 3 days. Customer Service does not exist, even for MEMBERS. These people are completely STUPID. Their system was down for most of the summer and NO ONE seemed to know what was wrong!!! COMPLETE INCOMPETENCE!!!! Use another bike service, take a SEGWAY tour, use the tour buses but AVOID this by ALL MEANS"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/10/2014,"Great service but be careful with charges We visited Washington last Saturday and it was very hot. We had researched Capital City Bike Tours and knew the drill re the 30 minute 'free' period.We loved the freedom on the bikes and saved our legs, enabling us to cover a lot more ground. A couple of fishhooks that other travellers should be aware of. We visited 4 bike hire stands in Georgetown before we found some with spaces ( there were 4 of us) eventually we had to split up and return two while the others biked off to find another.) it was so hot we were very tetchy and over it by the time we did eventually get rid of our bikes and caught a taxi back to Foggy Bottom after dinner.The next day we picked up bikes again from Foggy Bottom and had planned to visit Arlington Cemeterey, when we arrived we were told no bikes in the cemetery and so we split up- two watched the bikes and two of us made a very quick visit, then we swopped over. Either Capital Bikes need a bike stand there or don't plan to visit by bikes . We got stung $22US when we eventually dropped the bikes back. To make matters worse , we couldn't get a second bike , to bike back to Foggy Bottom, the machine kept saying we had had the maximum (two per credit card) we think perhaps the person before us who had a problem with his bike hire may have got our ticket ??? anyway we walked back to our hotel. I hope the people at Capital Bikes take note of both our problems and perhaps are able to rectify for other clients . It is great service and I would use again but probably not to Georgetown in the weekend as due to no metro in the area the bikes are well used and racks all full. They do have a service which allows you an extra 15 minutes and tells you where there are spaces but by the time we biked there they were all taken. We didn't mind paying an extra $2 for the second half hour but we were just over 2 hours for the hire to Arlington and that was $22 each which was a bit steep for the students in our group."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/20/2014,"Awful Customer Service I signed up for a year-long membership on August 1st. At the time, the website said there was a key shortage, but they would be back in stock at the end of July, so I didn't think anything of it. They also had a ShopHouse promotion going on in August that I was excited about.Flash forward to today, August 20th. Still no key. Still no free ShopHouse. I called them, explained my frustration, and asked what the status was. They told me it would be another 7-10 days.Keep in mind, I received no updates from them for the past three weeks.I had no intention to cancel my membership, but after the phone call full of excuses and being told I needed to patiently wait my turn, I realized I wanted no part of Capital Bikeshare. They held onto $75 of my money for a month without any service or updates to me. That's unacceptable.Capital Bikeshare is a great idea. I hope to be a member once they get their act together."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/18/2014,"a great service my first time-and I will do it again.  Finding the return racks when you are pressed for time is nerve wracking, but once you get the hang of it-it's a great way to see so many sites in this hot, crowded city."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/17/2014,"so worth it, for tired kids touring the mall This was a fun way to see the Mall and monuments. After walking for a few hours on the mall and seeing many monuments, we broke down and decided to rent some bikes to go see the Jefferson and FDR memorial, as we knew they were much further away and we were running low on energy. The only reason I do not give 5 stars is the $100 deposit per bike put on your credit card for about 10 days. The actual cost was about $20 per bike for a few hours; very worth while, though. This was the highlight for my ten year old son, thinking it was the coolest thing ever to ride from memorial to monument, and ringing the bell yelling ""on your left!"" Great family memory."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/11/2014,"Use the app Spotcycle and you can bike around DC for $7 a day! You can get these bike for $7 a day as long as follow the directions, which is dock them every 30 min! This is not hard as there are docks all around the city and one by every main point of interest you can think of. Use the app Spotcycle! It's free and will tell you where every docking station is, how many bikes are there and how many open docks. We only used these for 1 day but it saved our feet! We could get to the monument or museum we wanted, dock the bike, spend as much time as we wanted walking around then get a bike and ride to the next place. The app was a lifesaver and it wouldn't have been as good of an experience if we didn't have it. It even has a timer for you :) "
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/10/2014,"A MUST! Washington, DC, is sprawling and hoofing it can take a toll. You can choose the bus tours, but they can't hold a candle to seeing the sites on a bike! Download the APP to see what location is closest to you to either pick up or drop it off. They have many convenient locations! BIG TIP: either bring with or purchase a bike lock so you can lock your rental just steps away from where you'd like to get off and tour on foot. We had a bit of a search to find a lock, so my new purchase will be a permanent travel companion because these bike rentals are popping up all over major US cities! This is a very economical, time saving and fun way to tour DC for any age! We felt totally safe enjoying the sidewalks and obeying the traffic lights!!!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/03/2014,"A must to get around DC We are so glad we decided to try it. You can bike from one station to the next (under 30 mins) dock and restart a new trip. If you've never been to DC, the maps make things look like they are in close proximity to each other, but they are pretty far apart. Your feet will be thanking you."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/14/2014,"DO NOT hire these bikes We rented 2 bikes for 3 hours and ended up paying $90. Not to forget that they charge a deposit of $102 for each bike. (Which I have not received back and it has been a month). Have called multiple times on their customer service number but they are useless. It's cheaper to buy a bike from Walmart than to rent these extremely expensive, over priced bikes. The pricing on their website is not detailed at all and certainly not explained on the bike stations. Beware of the charges. Unless you are a millionaire."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,07/09/2014,"Don't Think You Can Rent a Bike for $7 a day Don't believe that you will get a bicycle for a day for $7. We rode two bicycles around to the monuments for 3 hours and were billed $90.00. The explanation was that the $14 charge was for a one day subscription and because we did not check the bicycles into a rack every 30 minutes we incurred overage charges of $38.00 per bicycle. Taxis would have been cheaper.The bikes were good and serviceable, but the charges are exorbitant."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/28/2014,"Best way to get around Totally worth the 15 bucks. We found these bikes very handy in getting around from site to site. There are so many stops to park them. We rode them to the hotel from the ballpark, there was a rack right outside both places. Traffic was very friendly to the us. They were so easy to use and have a basket for bags or purses.We loved them, very cheap transportation."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/21/2014,"Bikeshare and families We were in DC for a week and after walking all day our first two days we decided to do something different. We read the reviews for Bikeshare which was very helpful. We only bought a 3-day pass and for $28 for this family of four you can't beat it. I would highly recommend getting the bikeshare app, otherwise as a tourist you would be lost. I would also NOT recommend making your first tour use of this service for exploring the monuments at night. We, of course, did this and it's difficult to find the docking stations at night when you have a 30 minute window. Except for our run from the Archives Metro station to the Jefferson Memorial, this was an excellent way to see DC (our first run was too long for us since we were unfamiliar with the process and we almost didn't make it in the 30 minute time frame). Pros and Cons:Pro: If you want to have an easy way to get between memorials/sites and you don't want to have to worry about bringing a bike lock, this is perfect.Pro: Bikes were in good shape, easy to use (and to change seat height) and docking stations were convenientCon: You can only check out two bikes with one credit card, so it was a little time consuming to check the bikes out each time (had to use two credit cards and click though some questions).Con: Really this might just be for us, but we didn't bring helmets so we had to bike without themPro: Bike paths are very accessible and take you everywhere you'd want to go.Con: At night, we accidentally rode into the FDR memorial (thought we were still on path), the ranger was very polite in asking us to get off our bikes (we just felt terrible)Con: We wish the time frame was more like 45 minutes to an hour, but that might change the whole purpose of the bikeshare programAgain for a family of four (daughters 14 and 12), this was a great option. If we did it again, we'd go for the 3-day pass."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/19/2014,"Best way to see DC This is hands down the best way to see DC. We bought a 3-day pass, and it was well worth the $15. Once you pay your membership fee, any trip under 30 minutes is free, with additional fees applying after your half-hour is up. We would often take the Metro to one area of DC, check out bikes, and check them in again whenever we wanted to stop and take in a sight. This saved us the extra fees and the hassle of needing to find a safe place to leave your bike. My biggest tip is to download the Spotcycle app, which lets you see which racks have bikes and open stations. It saved us a ton of time, especially when we were exploring the memorials and tidal basin area."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/13/2014,"Importante tienen desconectado el telefono y los email no lo reaponden necesito mi dinero URGENTE please. Their telephone is disconnect. I need my money back from the hold,The amount is $202. PLEASE...Call me. I haven't receive a response to my email. Att Eliud"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/11/2014,"Fun day ride We rented bikes to go up and down King St in Alexandria. This was a really fun, reasonable way to see things up close and personal! i personally didn't feel the need to swap out every 30 minutes to avoid paying extra, although I'd certainly check them in if I was not actively riding to avoid excess costs. The hold on the debit card did not last the stated up to 10 days and was off the account with in 3 or 4 days. Fun way to explore, get some exercise, and see things a new way."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/10/2014,"Most Efficient Way to See DC Capital BikeShare is the best way to get around. There are stations pretty much anywhere you would want to leave the bike. It is a great deal! Only $15 per bike for 3 days. You can pick them up and drop them off whenever, wherever, and how ever many times you want. There is a $2 fee if you use the bikes for more than 30 minutes, but to get from one place to the next, this is not a problem. There was a station right across the street from our hotel, which was perfect. As for me, I know if I tried to walk all over DC, I would get tired real quick and that would slow me down. This way, you can ride to wherever you need to go, with no trouble. I highly suggest taking advantage of the Capital BikeShare if you would like to see DC in the most efficient and enjoyable way!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/10/2014,"Energy Saver! These bikes are absolutely amazing! We got the three day membership for $15 dollars and have been using the bikes all day, every day! We ride for 25 minutes then find the nearest docking station and switch bikes to avoid any charges, it's working perfect.Reviewers that say it's misleading are completely at fault, not the company. The signs are very straight forward and tell you exactly what to do. If you want to ride a bike all over the city for one day you pay a $7 membership fee PLUS any additional time beyond 30 minutes. Their intention is to get people from point A to point B only, not to keep a bike all day. After you pay the membership fee, it's free to take a bike for 30 minutes, after that you pay $2 for 31-60 minutes, $6 for 61-90 minutes and then $8 for each additional 30 minutes! Yes, they are actually penalizing you for keeping a bike all day and rewarding you for returning a bike after 30 minutes! Just go from dock to dock like we did and it's all free (except for the membership fee). Who in their right mind thinks they can rent a bike for 24 hours (or more) for $7??There are tons of docking places throughout the city and you can very easily find a dock within the free 30 minutes. Dock your bike then get a new code and un-dock the same bike, it's that easy! We have been all over from Capitol Hill to Dupont Circle to Georgetown to Arlington and have only had to pay the initial membership fee! Sweet deal!I highly recommend the bikes, don't hesitate, just follow the simple guidelines and you'll see more monuments and sites than you can imagine. You'll also do it way cheaper than the metro or cabs and you get to stay in total control of stopping and restarting. A real benefit is the wind blowing through your hair on a hot day - something you don't get when walking!"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/06/2014,"Get a bike and tour We only had a day to get around the mall. Seemed that every bike rental place = you had to take a tour, and one location. Bikeshare locations are everywhere. There's the initial fee, and hourly rates added on. We were told that the trick is to turn it in every half hour to save the extra fees. But, we were having too much fun riding them around, and stopping to see the monuments to worry about the fees. We did have a problem at 'check out'. My husband requested 2 bikes, but only one would unlock. Make sure you dock it back in correctly. Easy to follow on-line information."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/04/2014,"Capital Bikes makes it (kind of) easy to visit great sites I was in Washington D.C. this past week and decided to utilize their bike share program. To be fair, I am from Chicago and a member of the Divvy program which is run the same way so my familiarity with the system is high. I ended up explaining how the program worked to someone who was looking quizzically at the instructions on one station.Things to know:*You can buy a 24 hour or 3 day pass*This pass is good for unlimited use in that time frame however, you must redock your bike every 30 minutes in order to not be charged excess usage fees*You swipe a credit card to get started following the onscreen instructions*You will receive a 5 digit code which you can use to unlock any of the bikes at the station*Be aware that if a bike needs servicing, the seat may be turned around to show that it should not be selected*I suggest you set your seat height, numbered for future rental use, and any bags in the open sided basket before you enter the code to remove the bike*To remove the bike you may have to lift the rear of the bike to angle it out of its dock*Get on, make sure the bike work, watch for traffic and roll*Redock your bike, go back to the kiosk and reswipe your credit card to get a new release code to take a bike back out. The wait time to redock and get a new bike is about 30 seconds I believe. Use the same credit cardI highly recommend you download the free app SpotLab which will show you the location of other docks and offers a timer.I rode over to the National Mall and had a great time riding around, however I found that there was a surprising limitation of bike docks where I thought there should have been. There were no docks by the Vietnam Memorial and you cannot/should not bring your bike into any of the monuments anyway.There are a decent amount of bike lanes in DC that I would recommend riders use.The app said there was one open dock by the Lincoln Memorial, however when I got there and rechecked, there were in reality no open docks. I think there was an issue reading one of the bikes. I reswiped the previously used credit card to request 15 more minutes to try and find another open dock.I also used the bike to ride around various neighborhoods on my way back to DuPont circle area. It was a great way to see some of the homes, offices, consulates and was very enjoyable. However, always be a careful rider and obey your signals and stop signs. Nothing ruins a day more than ending up splat on the hood of a car, especially if you blew the right of way."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/01/2014,"Save your feet, rent a bike After one day of walking the national mall, we were coveting the bike riders. They are easy to rent and easy to ride. We were able to see so much more by bike. Cost is reasonable too. Only downside is after docking them, there is a chance you won't get one again in that location."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/30/2014,"Best way to commute or tour DC! For just a few dollars a day, ($7) getting around DC can be a breeze! Just be sure to re-dock your bike within 30 minutes, and simply pull out a new one--otherwise you'll incur some steep fees. Download the Spotcycle app to locate the 100s of docks where you can pick out and return a bike. There is a great rack on the front with ample room and a stretch chord to secure your items. The seats are easily adjustable with a quick release tab, and the bikes are comfortable and easy to handle. Have fun!"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/30/2014,"Nice way to see all sights around The Mall at own pace Initially I had thought we would buy tickets for a hop on hop off bus tour, but given their inflated prices and time required, we decided to create our own program around The Mall with bicycle and use public transport for the longer distances. Registering at a rental station was not as easy as explained, some cards were not liked even though advertised as accepted. Some better/updated explanation panels are needed.Had fun cycling around. If you time it right, you can make use of the first free 30 minutes of use (after paying the $7 day membership) and swap bikes before your paid minutes start counting.Nice way of getting around and seeing the sights and getting to know a large area in a short time. On The Mall and surrounding streets you are allowed to cycle on the sidewalk by exception."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/28/2014,"Save your legs, rent a bike for the day! We spent five days in DC sightseeing and 10 plus miles a day on concrete is hard on the legs. Our last day there we decided to do the capital bikeshare and what a wonderful way to see the city! I see some reviews about the site being misleading, it's not, you just need to read the instructions. They spell it out very clearly. NEED TO KNOW ABOUT RENTAL:If you read their website and understand how it works you'll be happy.* There are a few different options, getting a key or getting a code. Since we just rented one day so we did the code. Each time you want a bike you swipe the CC you reserved the bike on and it will print you out a code. You can choose a bike and go. * Understand the pricing structure. For the daily rental it was a $7.00 base charge. Each time you unlock a bike you get the first 30 minutes free and then an additional rate is charged for each section of time. Example: We rented and rode to the National Cathedral (and got lost) so it took us longer than 30 minutes, think it was about 55 minutes, we had an additional $2.00 charge for that specific trip since it took us 55 vs 30 minutes. The rest of the day we rented five more times (back to the mall and didn't get lost, around the tidal basin, up the mall and a few other stops in between) and there was no additional charges since we kept each trip to under 30 minutes. Over all we put on 28 miles and paid $9.00 for the day which I think it really reasonable.*There are bike racks all over the city, there's a great app to tell you how many bikes are available and how many slots are open. The BIKES:These are NOT commuter bikes, and they were a far cry from the road bike I am use to. They are heavy, there are only three speeds and they are built for ALL body types. I wouldn't plan on riding one out to Mt. Vernon by any means. But they are great around the city and mall and for stents under 10 miles. The bikes we had were all in good condition and were comfortable. They also do not come with helmets. If you stick to the trails it's not a bid deal, but riding up to the Cathedral was a little hair-raising in DC traffic. If your planning ahead pack a helmet. Great to see a program like this, very user friendly and a great way to see the sites."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/26/2014,Great way to see the city!!! This is a must do if you like the outdoors! Stations are conveniently stationed around the city. Convenient setup and 3 day rental a good deal. Bikes are well maintained and there were always bikes available. DC has great biking trails and lanes all around. Enjoy it! 
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/10/2014,sightseeing while saving your feet  Kind of complicated at first! 24 hour pass is $7 only if you return within 30 minute intervals. Basically rent it. Ride somewhere you want to go or just for 20 minutes. Return it at next station. If you want a long ride return it at a station within 30 minutes and grab another one as soon as you return the other! Best way to travel the mall and see Jefferson! 
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,05/05/2014,"Misleading Company Charges More than Expected Like many others here I experienced the misleading nature and false advertising offered by Capital Bikeshare in Washington. It leads you to believe you will be paying $7 for 24hrs which seems very fair and reasonable. This is not the case and I was charged over $20 for 2 hours only. This is very disappointing, as no one renting these bikes would have read through every single agreement written on those small screens before renting their bikes. It is unfair and this company is taking advantage of the fact that tourists would rent the bikes without reading each and every single page of agreements. In Canada I would be reporting this business to the Better Business Bureau as I say they are operating a scam and are relying on those individuals who would not fight to get their money back."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/30/2014,"Easy and fun Bikes are in excellent condition, stations are in convenient locations, and DC is more bike friendly than it used to be!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/30/2014,"Best way to see the sights So convenient, with stalls abundant through out town. A little pricey, but so worth it! Your feet will thank you! The Jefferson Memorial is a long way out there folks! Note that you can only rent 2 bikes per credit card and they dont accept American Express. But check out the informative website for pricing and map of all the many places to return your bikes at the end of a long and exciting day. We returned at Union Station, went in to see the beautiful train station, had dinner and then took the night tour to see it all lit up! I've done the mall many times, and this is definitely the way to go. It's flat easy riding, the traffic is mainly pedestrian, and no crowded buses to deal with! "
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/23/2014,"Easiest Way to Get Around and Very Affordable The Capitol Bikeshare in Washington is one of the best that I've experienced. There are tons of stations around the city, and it's super easy to get around. It also helps that there are many bike trails and bike lanes, so there are designated spots for bikers. The city is very bike friendly because the population is mostly young and 40% of the people don't own cars. This means that the cars are also well aware of bikers and are used to them on the road, which helps.The way it works is this:1. Get a membership. It's $7/day or $15/3 days or more for longer periods (you can get a yearly or monthly membership also I believe)2. Use your credit card at any of the bike stations in the machines provided to buy the membership of your required length3. Once you buy the membership, you will get a 5 digit code. Use this code to enter on the little pad beside each bike. Once the light turns green, pull out your bike (sometimes have to use two hands)4. The membership allows you unlimited use of the bikes in (and this is the important part) - 30 minute intervals. This means that you will have no additional charges if you return the bike to another station within 30 minutes. The city is small enough that most places can be reached within the 30 minute limit. The point of this is to allow other people to use the bikes as well, and the bikes are meant as a form of getting from point A to point B, not keeping the bikes for the entire day (although you can do this, but you may end up paying hundreds of dollars, like the poor chap that called the service a scam below. It's not a scam - you just have to read the instructions properly. You are charged for every additional hour you don't return the bike). If you don't think you'll make it in time to your desired station, you may stop at another station and request additional time. You do this by inserting your credit card, and pressing the 'renew' button. This allows you an extra 15 minutes to get to the next station that is closest to your destination, or if the station you wanted is full and there is no space to leave the bike.5. If you require the bike for longer than 30 minutes, you may return to the station, wait 5 minutes (or walk to the next station) and get another bike, repeating the process above. The five digit code you get the first time will only be active for 5 minutes from the time you get it. Every time you want a new bike, you'll have to get a new code by inserting your credit card into the machine. Your credit card will not get charged again - it's only used to determine that you've already purchased a membership and to get a new code.6. Returning the bike, make sure you push it in hard into the stand, and make sure the green light comes on - this means the bike is locked back in.. 7. For those that have smart phones, you can download the Capital bike app (available on their website or from the app store) that will give you real-time information about how many bikes are available at each station or how many free spaces are available, so you don't have to waste time looking for the next available station if the one you want is full, or doesn't have bikes. It's also handy because it gives you the locations of all stations.There are many stations around the city and it's very easy to use and get around. In the three days that we rode around, there was only one instance where the station was full and we had to find the next one (5 minutes away - press the 'renew' button to get more time). Since we didn't have data services, we didn't have the real-time information for which stations were full/empty, but we could still see the station locations. We found that biking was more convenient and cheaper than the metro because there are more bike stations than there are metro stations, so it was easier to get closer to our desired destinations. Not to mention being able to get a better look at the city, and get some exercise.If you use the service properly, you'll have a great experience."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/21/2014,"Scam We were led to believe the bikes would be $7 per day if we didn't exceed 8 hours. This company is a total scam and they tried to charge us $276 for the use of 2 bikes for 2 days. Their fee schedule is ludicrous, very poorly shown at the stations, misleading, and nothing but a scam! Go to a regular bike shop and rent a decent bike with helmets provided, etc. Read the other negative reviews that explain how these folks were taken in."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/15/2014,"Best way for tourists to get around! Buy a pass and save on cabs.  Pedal around the monuments, around Capitol Hill, to the zoo, in Rock Creek Park."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/13/2014,Convenient!!!! The bikes are a life saver! One day I walked all day it I was so tired after and didn't get that far.But when I rented the bikes I saw so much more and had fun riding the bikes. It's $7 a day. Totally use it!!
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/09/2014,Great way to see the city! These bikes are GREAT! Such a fun way to tour around. Biking on the mall at night seeing the monuments was one of my favorite things we did in DC! The call center is very helpful if there is a problem. Be sure and download the app so you can check available bikes and docks near you. It is a great app! NOTE: Be sure and put the key fob on a key chain or zipped in a pocket. Mine accidentally came out when I grabbed my phone from my pocket :-(
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,02/03/2014,"Excellent bikeshare system Washington DC has it's issues, but the ability to get around without a car is possibly its best amenity.Capital Bikeshare is what every city thinking of instituting a bike program should emulate.With a membership, you get as many 30 minute rides as you like. And if yu use it alot, it makes sense to pay for the keyfob. No swiping credit cards at the kiosk; just insert the keyfob and the bike unlocks from the rack. Quick and easy.And they have kiosks everywhere!!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,01/01/2014,"Best way to see the city... We rented bikes in DC on our recent trip. It was so easy to set up and we saw the whole city in a fraction of the time as it would take walking or riding the metro. Do yourself a favor and grab a bike when you are in DC. You can practically ride them anywhere (sidewalks, streets, parks), but don't ride them into the memorials/monuments, just walk them up or pop them on a bike stand. There are stands EVERYWHERE. They have apps that will show you where they all area and how many bikes are available at each one. The app we used was Spotcycle."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/14/2013,"A wonderful way to see the Capital... When we arrived in DC, with very little planned for our day trip from NYC, we had no idea where to start, but right out the front of union station I spotted these little babies and off we went. It is just like the 'Citi Bikes' bike share system in NYC, and I love both equally as much. It was a great way for us to see every along the national mall (I was ignorant to the sheer size of the place), and thankfully there was bike ports almost everywhere. We also tested the friendship (half hr free rule) by riding into Georgetown, and lucky for us we made it. It is a great way to see the Capital, and an entertaining one at that.I would highly recommend it!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/10/2013,"Rode a lot, convenient, but rules not clear I rode a lot this time I visited DC. Very convenient. It is better than using taxi or driving cars around town. There are many stations around town. And the number is growing day by day. Some minor gripes. It is not always easy to find the stations at night even if you have a map. There is no options for kids. Some bikes needs maintenance. I wish there is a clock on the bike telling how much time you have spent, since it charges fees for a ride over 30 mins. I wish there is a way to get safety helmets. Pretty good. Highly recommended."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/06/2013,Great time! BIke racks were everywhere. So easy to hop on and off. Machines were easy to use. Phone app for stations is fantastic. Can't recommend enough!
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/01/2013,"fun way to see more on the Mall inexpensive, easy, much more fun than walking.what would take hours to stroll on the Mall can be seen much more quickly on two wheels.it's a great thing for both tourists and locals, alike.the free smartphone app is an easy way to find stands to check-out or return a bike. do budget in a little extra time in case the stand you choose is full, that nearly happened to me as I was returning to Union Station. No harm done."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/24/2013,"An alternative way to see DC! I have been in DC for nearly a year and I never tried the red bikes yet until last weekend. I always see people going around with those red bikes and I pass by the bike stands every day on my way to work. So we (my boyfriend) rented 2 bikes for more than 4 hours and we paid $42 ($7 each for daily membership fee, the first 30 minutes is free, $2 per hour onwards). DC is a bike friendly place with dedicated bike lanes in most areas. You can pedal your way in the sidewalks too and the people respectfully give way to you.Compared to walking from one site to another, biking is way better! And it is more beautiful and magical at night! You can return the bikes anywhere as long as there is an available stand to accommodate your bike. As we returned them and had dinner in Chinatown, we were able to get them back (since we already paid the $7 day membership) and continued with our sight seeing.You pay using your card and it has been a week since, I believe it is well secured for using cards.It was a very fun and exciting experience and I'm set to being a biking tour guide when I have friends coming over to the nation's capital."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/19/2013,"The Best way to get around DC For $7 per 24 hours you can check at a 3 speed bicycle from one of dozens of bike stands located through out the downtown. Return the bicycle to another stand within 30 minutes and you avoid further charges. Exceed the 30 minutes and they charge you an ever increasing surcharge. ($ 2 for 31 to 60 minutes, 4 or 6$ if you exceed 1 hour, etc.) While it was a bit of a hassle finding a bicycle station at times that was a small price to pay to avoid additional blisters on my feet. Bicycling is the only way to get around the city."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/18/2013,Bike the Sites! Capital Bikeshare is the only way to see DC! Metros are crowded and you miss all the sites. Renting a bike is a great way to quickly navigate the streets of DC. WABA! (Where A Bike At?) is a free app that can point you to the nearest station with availibility. We purchased a 3 day pass for $15. There are usage fees if you keep the bike for more than 30 minutes but its very easy to avoid this charge by checking the bike in at the nearest stand every 30 minutes. Usage fees start at $2 an hour. Still a deal IMO. I suggest renting a bike at night to tour all the Monuments while they are lit up at night. This is a great experience minus the crowds.
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,10/12/2013,"The ONLY way to do D.C. Forget crazy traffic and crazier traffic patterns--the ONLY way to see DC is with this bikeshare. My husband and I (who both grew up in DC), recently came back for a wedding and stayed in Rosslyn. Rather than deal with the headache of driving/parking/paying to park, we decided to bike over the bridge and spend the day hopping the attractions. The bikeshare made it simple and easy--the stations are everywhere!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/28/2013,"BEST way to get around DC! So I was standing on the Mall near the Washington Monument with sore shins and feet from walking so much. I wanted to get to the Lincoln Memorial, but was dreading the walk. Then I see a row of similar bikes on locked racks. I see that I can sign up for 24-hour period for $7 and use a bike for free (no usage fee) for up to 30 minutes (30 - 60 add $2, 60 - 90 add $6). So I grabbed a bike and leisurely rode down the mall to the Lincoln Memorial, stopping at the WWII and Vietnam memorials. I returned the bike to the closest rack and moved on.After that I grabbed another bike off the same rack, looked at the map of rack locations all around the mall AND Washington DC, made my plan of where to go to next, then proceeded to tour the rest of the mall area. No walking needed.This service is fantastic. I saw MANY people using it and it makes perfect sense! No wasting time walking between distant attractions.By the way, the bikes are HEAVY three speed units not meant for any kind of speed. They are intended for leisurely use."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/25/2013,"Tough finding docking stations without a Smart phone My wife and I made our first visit to D.C. the weekend following Labor Day for half a week and used Capital Bikeshare one day to get from our hotel at Dupont Circle to the National Mall. From the Mall, we headed off on the bikes to a lunch venue, then back to some Smithsonian museums, then around the Mall some more, and finally to a Metro station to head back to the hotel.The directions at each station are clear cut. Rental for the day is $7. Rental for 3 days is $15. You've got the use of the bikes for a 24 hour period if you rent for the day like we did. Every 30 minutes you must re-dock your bike at another station if you want to avoid additional fees, $2 for the next 30 minutes (31-60 minutes), $4 more dollars for the next 30 minutes (61-90) minutes. Payment options are credit or debit only. After docking your bike for the first time and ready to check another one out for another 30 minutes, you simply re-scan your credit/debit card at the pay station and follow the directions to retrieve your unlock code which is valid for 5 minutes. You don't get dinged each time you slide your card.You can dock a bike at a station and immediately check another one out too. There are docking stations all over the place, but a few times we couldn't find a station that was indicated on the online or station map, and many times we passed by stations that weren't on the maps at all. When I speak of these maps, I'm talking about the website and the ones at the pay/docking stations. There are no hard copy maps available. Since we don't have phones with internet capabilities, we felt lost on more than one occasion searching for another docking station. Reading other reviews, it sounds like their app is very helpful. However, we were always able to find another station within the allotted 30 minutes. A 45 minute allotment of time would be much better and leave the rider feeling much less rushed. If planning on using them to tour the memorials at the National Mall, you'll be very rushed or will have to skip stuff, dock the bike, and backtrack on foot. There's a station by the Washington Monument, one by the Jefferson Memorial, and one by the Lincoln Memorial on the west side of the mall where all of the memorials are.My wife had trouble with her seat staying put on a couple of occasions so make sure you grab a bike that has a seat that locks down tight. After sunset, we rode around the National Mall to see everything again, and that was great. The flashing LED headlights don't provide a ton of light however. The lights, I believe, are mostly there as a safety measure for you to be seen by others. There are other bike rental companies in town that offer usage for the entire day if that's what you're looking for. My wife used similar bikes in Boulder, CO earlier this year and had a bit friendlier experience than here in D.C. We'd certainly try these again, but would make sure we upgraded to a smart phone next time to make life considerably easier."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/18/2013,"Very Good Site Seeing Option for DC My experience was overall good. Once we actually had the bikes, it was an easy 2 hour site seeing ride through DC. The simple 3 gear options worked perfectly for tough hills. **Issues**1.) The first issue is the touch screen machine needed to be re-calibrated due to it taking almost 30 minutes to enter in my information due to the wrong number showing each time I pressed one. For example, I kept pressing number ""5"", but ""6"" would show up. It was very annoying. Other than that.......GREAT EXPERIENCE !!!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/29/2013,"Fantastic way to get around. Whoever came up with this idea is simply genius! Great way to get around the city, we had a bus tour and used these for the 2 days we were in town and it worked a treat. so much faster than walking and the breeze is nice too. I would recommend downloading the app so you can get live updates on how many bikes are at each station and where the closest station is. The app also has a rental timer to help return the bike within 30 mins to avoid rental charges.READ THE BOARD BEFORE RENTING!!! I have read a few reviews on here of people getting confused with the pricing and thinking they could keep the bike for the whole day for $7. It is not hard to understand and my husband and I found it very clear in the fact that the rental was $7 for 24 hours and during that 24 hrs if you returned bike within 30 mins it was free, and then it had the charges for if you returned after the 30 mins. simple! there are so many bike stations around that it was so easy to re dock the bikes within the 30 mins period, we never went over our time period and were not inconvenienced by having to re dock the bikes. Occasionaly we docked and re docked straight away to avoid charges if we were planning on riding a bit further."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/21/2013,Brilliant way to get around DC Myself and my girlfriend were in DC in April 2013 and used these bikes. It's a fabulous way to get around to all the main sites and I would highly recommend it as it is far better than a bus and there is a lot of ground to cover on foot if you are only there for a short stay like us.
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/11/2013,"Very nice on Summer The capital bikeshare are very practical if you like to feel the ambiance of the city. It's better than subway, first because it is very less expensive and also because your outside while travelling between monuments.
We enjoy very much our day pass !"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/04/2013,"Best way to get around the city! We have used these very accessible modes of transportation to enhance our sightseeing experience in the downtown and extended areas of DC. My husband discovered this unique, cost effective, ""enjoy at your own pace"" way to travel around the city during the busy Inauguration and again when we visited the city in the Spring! We were able to go places and experience sights that we would not have seen from a car. It was a totally amazing riding directly down the center of Pennsylvania Avenue, from the White House to Capitol Hill, since they had removed the traffic lights in preparation for the Inauguration. We explored the National Mall and Smithsonian Museums, the Washington Monument, Reflecting Pool, Lincoln Memorial, around the Tidal Basin with its many meaningful monuments, to the Jefferson Memorial. In the Spring, we explored the Arlington National Cemetery. It is easy to use the pick-up and drop-off kiosks, with many stations a short distance from one another. The bikes have three speeds and are simple to maneuver. I highly recommend giving this a try, because I am not a cyclist and had so much fun each time."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/30/2013,"A good way to get around - but don't expect to find a bike every time. First off: hats off to any city that's doing its bit to promote this kind of transport system. Washington's heart is certainly in the right place. $7 for a day of travel around the sights of the National Mall and further afield to Arlington and Georgetown is certainly good value. To clarify: you have 30 minute window to get your bike docked into another station, not the 90 as one review has it, though you do get a 'safety' 15 minutes if you find all of the stations full when you reach your destination. Given that the metro is $2.70 a ride (when including the paper card) you can save yourself some money and sore feet with the bike.The bikes are simply and easy to ride, and you can get a reasonable shunt going if you're so inclined, though I'm not sure why you'd want to unless you're a DC commuter heading into work, and then why are you reading this?Here's the health warning: there are lots of tourists and bikes can become a premium in certain places (the Lincoln Memorial for example) so you can't expect to rock up and find one. The app is good, but doesn't update strictly in real time: by the time you reach the station the bikes might be gone. Some people are quite canny at dropping a bike then swiping for another 30 minutes, so pairs of bikes are sometimes hard to come by.Personally, I wouldn't plan a day around using a bike, especially if you have are under time pressure to get back somewhere, but if you can afford to be a bit more relaxed this might be a fun, and useful, bonus attraction."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/30/2013,"Greatest thing ever Couldn't be a better way to explore DC. Download the Capital Bikeshare app for $1.99 or, even better, SpotCycle app for free. You can see where you are and find locations of CB bikes. There's even a timer so you can stop < 30 minutes. Best to carry your own helmet on a daypack. Simply brilliant!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/08/2013,The best way to get around town! This is the best concept - excellent way to get around DC. You pay a flat fee for a day ($7) or three days ($15) then short trips (less than 90 min) are free. You simply check bikes in and out of conveniently located bike stations. DC is very bike friendly city just check your routes as there is a lot of construction around the city and rising with kids could be dicey. We found this to be FAR superior to walking the city! And there is an app available that shows you maps and bike stations - AWESOME! Every city should have this system.
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/19/2013,"Best way to see DC - EVER! I can't tell you how much we enjoyed using Capital Bikeshare! It was so convenient and so much fun. What a great way to tour the city. We found them near every single place we wanted to visit! You pick up the bike at one of their many kiosks, drive it to your destination, drop the bike at the kiosk and then pick up a new bike when you are ready to move on to your next destination. Please pay attention to their fees though. I saw that some people who reviewed them on tripadvisor were not aware of the way they charge, so they ended up paying way more than they thought. This is more of a form of transportation from one place to another, not a way to tour around the city for the day. It is $7 for the day and you can have each bike for 1/2 hour at a time. Additional time is charged after that first 1/2 hour."
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/13/2013,"Great potential but falls short Experience for the first hour was great. We understood the requirements to return bikes to station within 30 minutes to avoid any charges other than initial 1 day membership cost. However, when ""system"" reported that bike was not returned (at all) after I had returned it within 30 minutes, it became my word against the report out of their ""system"". There is nothing that consumer gets to prove that you've returned their $1,000 bike properly. Customer service couldn't do anything for me because all I could tell them was that I saw a green light when I returned bike to the rack. Luckily ""system"" reported bike returned in a few hours so did not have to argue a $1,000 replacement bike charge."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,06/11/2013,Scam. You will be charged a lot more then they specify! An unspecified charge will appear on your card. Renter be warned. 2hours is $75.00. And there will not be a phone number to call about these extravagant charges because their customer service phone does not work properly. Please avoid being doped by this government backed racket.
DC,3,Neutral,TripAdvisor,05/31/2013,"Warning for cost of $10/hour for Bike, even if buy ""membership"" ! Warning needed for cost of Capital Bike Share. As a tourist I loved the use of a bike. BUT confusing pricing. A quick look at it, along with my daughter who lives there looking at it, and past experience of anything else, you think you either pay something like $2 per thirty minutes OR get the $7 per day. But it should be summarized as : "" $7 to register to get 30 minutes free ONLY if you dock it for at least one minute, then restart; you, must pay $2 every 30 minutes and re-dock every 30 min ; registration “membership” last 24 hours; warning- failure to re-dock it every 30 minutes can cost $10 per hour ! See confusing pricing table below."""
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/27/2013,"Best way to get around!!! Our 12 year old son bugged us all day to get bikes around the Mall near Capitol. We finally gave in on day 2! Little did we know how brilliant he was! We got 4 bikes and were off! We sailed around monuments and thousands of motorcycles with the Rolling Thunder Ralley. We rode for hours and covered more ground than we could have in a week! Best of all, we returned bikes right next to hotel as there are racks all over the city! Best $24 spent on trip!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,05/13/2013,"See the District for $7! A terrific deal, when one understands that you have 30 minutes to get to another bike rack. We made terrific use of the system and got to see all the major sights in a matter of hours. Highly recommended, and looking forward to NYC getting this system soon!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/25/2013,"Take a ride around DC for $7 you have DC at your disposal. A great way to cover a lot of ground, get to quieter corners and get exercise. I took a bike out early in the morning and biked instead of a treadmill in the hotel ""gym"" The route I chose passed: Viet Nam Vet memorial, MLK memorial, FDR memorial, Jefferson Memorial and Lincoln Memorial. What an inspiring way to begin a day. With 150 pick-up/drop-off spots, you can get anywhere on these bikes! Have fun, take a spin."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/22/2013,Scam This company is nothing short of a scam. Intentionally misleading about their rates. Thought we were renting 3 bikes for 3 hours for $21 ($7 per bike per day) Instead we were charged $160 on our credit card. Went to their website and read the fine print - something very difficult to do on the small LED screen (27 pages) at the rental KIOSK. The KIOSK advertises Bike Rental's for 24/hours - $7. Shame on them.
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,04/22/2013,"SCAM!!!!!!! IF YOU READ THE 127 PAGES OF FINE PRINT, and understand it, you will realize that the very simple sign on the point of sale station that clearly says $7 for 24hours, means something totally different!the company clearly intends to benefit from leading people astray.we were charged $161 for using bikes that we thought would cost $21."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/22/2013,"One the best things I have ever done in a city--EVER! This is such a super cool way to get around and bike racks are everyone.  LOVED IT!  Bikes were nice and new, and I want to own one of them!"
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/19/2013,"A quick fun way to get around Washington DC We spent most of the day using the Bikeshare and had such a good time. You collect the bike at a station for $7 for a day and that's all it costs unless you return the bike late. Every 30 mins you need to find another 'bike station' to leave the bike at, go and walk around in that area, then go back to the bike station and take another one. You must return the bike every 30 mins or you will be charged an additional $2 or an additional $6 if you return within an hour. It was a great way to get around quickly as Washington is a big place, but trying to find a bus station became an issue a few times. We didn't have a map as we didn't have access to a computer, so we had to stop and ask a few times. Beware that 30 mins on the bike goes very fast and you may find yourself a long way away from another 'station'. Having a map should stop that from happening. The whole day cost us $9 each which was a huge saving compared with the hop on hop off bus etc. Would recommend this."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/08/2013,"Think of it as a taxi or a metro for $7/day I see that some people are confused by the fee. If you want to keep a bike all day long, this is not for you. If you want to use a bike as a means of transportation, this is a great option!!! You really can see a lot of the city that way, you just have to give up your bike for few minutes. Go explore, walk around, take some pictures, visit a museum, eat and then get on a bike again (maybe even the same bike you left few minutes ago :) and bike for up to 30 minutes to your next destination."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/08/2013,"Excellent program, need more stations We liked the bikeshare program. I just wish there were more stations to rent/return the bikes.The program is really simple. $15 gets you a 3-day membership and there is no charge if you return the bike within 30 minutes. Just $2 if you keep it for an extra 30 minutes.My son is 11 and he could ride the bikes with no problem. The national mall is all bike-friendly. The bike lane down Pennsylvania Avenue is well worth it. You are riding right in the CENTER of the road but the cars aren't in your way. Sounds weird, but it really works nice. Take a bike ride from the Capitol to the White House. Just wish there were more stations near the Capitol itself.I'd highly recommend using bikes to get around DC. Your feet will thank you."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/04/2013,"Quite a Ride! This is the way to go if you want to see the monuments and give your aching feet a break! We rented bikes on a beautiful, sunny day and we were so glad we did! We quickly saw all the major monuments - bike rental for a day was only $7. I would highly recommend this!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,04/02/2013,"Awesome way to see the monuments! This service was FABULOUS! We wanted to do the bike thing at our leisure and didn't want to be committed to opening hours for a bike rental shop. Capital Bikeshare has an option for one day membership and the rates were reasonable. There are stations everywhere - and with their iPhone app you can check to see where bikes are available and where return points are. Note that I emailed Capital Bikeshare to get information not covered on their website FAQ and no one ever got back to me - but in the end we didn't need the info anyway.We chose to do a night ride through the mall. The bikes had lights that were suitable given the lighting available in the surrounding - but you might want to bring a flashlight or headlight if you choose to do a night ride. We kept the bikes longer than we expected - but the rate was no different than had we rented from a shop but we had flexibility. A note to one-day renters. You can get 2 bikes with one credit card - but if you need more than 2 bikes you need a DIFFERENT credit card and they only take Mastercard and Visa. Also - the bike security hold fee stayed on both my credit cards for about 5 days (I know this is not in Capital Bikeshare's control - but worth noting). The bikes have little baskets with a bungee that hold items fairly securely. The bikes are utilitarian and not meant for a comfy beach cruise or a cross-country tour - so be prepared for a hard ride. The bikes were in great shape and easily adjustable to our different heights.Note that if you do a mall ride at night - the mall can be quite busy even at night. We found that people were shocked to see bikes near the monuments and some thought it was a great idea and others told us that people should only walk to the monuments (and no we weren't pulling jumps off of Lincoln or anything like that, and we walked the bikes when we got to the monuments) - in any case the bikes seemed to garner a lot of attention.This was my husband's favourite part of our trip.And remember your helmet!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,03/21/2013,"Every city should have a Capital Bikeshare Capital Bikeshare is a wonderful addition to DC. The service is affordable and accessible. The bikes can be picked up and returned almost anywhere in central DC. I rented a bike several times over the days I was in DC and rode from my hotel to the National Gallery, to the mall, and to the Lincoln Memorial at night. DC is an easy city to navigate by bike. It's mostly flat. Yet on foot, the distances between museums and monuments can feel long and tiring. The bikes from Capital Bikeshare are perfect. If you're at all inclined to ride bikes, look for Capital Bikeshare next time you're in DC."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,02/17/2013,"Great way to see Washington DC! We had so much fun riding the bikes from monument to monuments. It's definitely a time saver, and not only that, riding at your own pace means we could enjoy the sights and cover all the things we wanted to see. The bikes are easy to rent, just use your credit card, and it's so convenient to dock the bikes for return. We rode on footpaths, through the gardens and went from the White House to the Washington Monument, up the Reflecting Pool to the Lincoln Memorial, then along the river to Jefferson Memorial before heading to Capitol Hill. We docked the bikes outside the Smithsonian Castle then made our way by foot to the see the Natural History museum. Weather was bit cool and it started to snow during the afternoon but what a blast we had! Bikes felt very safe and it's very easy to ride with a few simple gears that you can change to help you ride up or downhill. No helmets provided and it's one of the rare chances you take to feel the wind in your hair!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,12/02/2012,What a timesaver This is the second trip to DC when I used the bikes. The first I was close to the Mall and I rode all around the central area. The most recent time I was near DuPont Circle and rode down the trail along the parkway to the Mall. Both were excellent. I could not have covered as much ground on foot. This is a great option for tourists. The kiosks are well located for sightseeing.
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,11/13/2012,"Awesome way to see the city Forget about long tiring walks- one sure fire fun way to see the monuments and the interesting neighborhoods of DC is by bike - and Capital Bikeshare is definitely tops! Bikes are plenty and available at key strategic points all over. My buddy and I purchased day pass for USD 7 and we are allowed unlimited 30 minute use within 24 hours. It was fun. Biking to see the impressive monuments, putting back the bikes in the racks, and picking them back again to go to another location. "
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/24/2012,"an excellent system Due to a Metro delay, I found myself running very late to meet friends for dinner. Not wanting to spring for a cab (and realizing that it would not be any faster than walking, due to rush-hour traffic), I decided to give Bikeshare a try. Amazingly, you can join right at the kiosk if you want a 1-day or 3-day membership. I got to dinner on time -- there was a drop-off pod a block from the restaurant -- and got a little exercise, too. I liked it so much I used it again later that night to get back across town when I wasn't near a Metro stop, and then again the following day to get down the National Mall when I decided the weather was too hot to walk so far in direct sun. Each time I easily found nearby bike pods using the Spotcycle iPhone app, and there was always at least a couple of bikes waiting for me in my preferred pickup spot, and plenty of return spaces near my destination (although you get an extra 15 minutes free if you try to return to a pod that's full).Your membership gets you free rides up to 30 minutes in length, with increasing hour rates the longer you keep the bike. (I took a total of 5 rides and none of them were longer than 30 minutes, so I paid only the $7 daily fee.) Then, each time you use the same credit card, the systems recognize you as an existing member.Riding on the street in rush-hour is not for the fainthearted, although you're allowed to ride on the sidewalk outside of the downtown core, and a few dedicated ""bike boulevards"" on major streets (there are maps online of both). I wish we had bikeshare in my city -- it's a great way to get around this mostly-flat city."
DC,2,Negative,TripAdvisor,09/19/2012,"THEIR BIKES ARE A SAFETY HAZARD City bikes is a very convenient service, they're located all over the DC metro area and have countless stations, where most of the time you can get a bike without too much hassle. The price increased somewhat since my last visit, and at $7 for a day plus charges for trips exceeding 30 mins (when their bicycles are really slow) is a bit steep. Visibility on the little LCD displays where you pay and get a code so you can unlock your bicycle is marginal at best, and under direct sunlight almost impossible to read.That being said, their bicycles are HORRIBLE. They have 3 speeds: slow, slower and barely moving, and steering is severely impaired. This makes for a very unsafe bicycle when you're moving in the middle of traffic. I don't know the statistics, but am almost surprised I didn't get into an accident while riding their clunker through DC streets. And I'm basically a bike commuter, not an athlete or a messenger. Keep that in mind if you decide to use the service."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/12/2012,"Great way to see the sights!!! We stayed in Alexandria, Va and used these bikes for 2 days several hours a day for a total of $7/day. You can't beat that! We rode all around Alexandria and then took the Mount Vernon trail along the water from Old Town to by Reagan airport to Crystal city. You can rent and return as much as you want, you just have to limit each ride to 30 minutes or you incur an additional charge. The Spotcycle app is a must! It shows you all the stations and how many bikes and slots are available in real time. Highly recommended!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/04/2012,"Best Decision of Our Trip My wife and I spent 5 days in DC in August and have been there many times in the past. This time we had set out expecting to walk and use the metro for all of our travel needs, until we saw the Capital Bike Share program. What a great service! We paid for the 3 day membership and used the bikes almost exclusively during our entire trip. Very economical and a great way to see DC and still save time. I highly recommend using this program if you are on vacation and are going from sight to sight."
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,09/03/2012,"See the monuments at night at your own pace! I highly recommend seeing all the monuments at night by bike. Capital Rideshare has bike stations all over DC. Their website tells you where they are (125 throughout the city) Its almost a bike vending machine. We rented them near the mall, took our time seeing all the monuments (at night they are beautiful), and then rode them back to a bike station near our B&B and returned them there. Great, inexpensive way to see DC."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/26/2012,"Great way to get around cheaply in DC I've use this kind of bike share system in Europe but I'm happy to see it's been brought to DC which is such a great city to get around - NOT in a car. There are so many great sights in DC that you almost want to walk...but then that's a bit slow. So, put your credit card, in one of the hundred or so Capital Bikeshare stations, follow the instructions, and for a mere $7/day, you can bike the city. Pick up a bike in one spot and drop it off in another. To make it ever easier, be sure to download the the Spotcycle iPhone App so you know where the bike stations are, and even if there are bikes there at that moment."
DC,4,Positive,TripAdvisor,08/19/2012,"Meant for short fun rides-if doing it for recreational My husband & I decided it was a pretty day & we wanted to spend a day outside. We decided to rent the little ""red bikes"". I have been in the DMV area for less than a year & we currently do not own our own bikes, so we saw that Capital Bikeshare had the most docks & that the website actually shows you how many are available at each dock. What the website does not tell you--which I can is being misleading--is the fact that it's $7 for the first 30 mins, but there are additional fees for the extra time & there is a $101 deposit per bike...for us, it wasn't a big deal...we originally planned to go from 10th & constitution to Georgetown, but after we saw the price, we decided to change our ride to around the national mall & see the MLK memorial. We never had intentions on biking all day, so the 1.5 hours was perfect for us & still an inexpensive, fun way to tour DC. Definitely not meant for long rides. Would do it again...We plan to buy bikes but until then, Capital Bikeshare works for us!"
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/16/2012,SCAM We thought this was a great way to explore the city for just 7$ a day. To our surprise once we received out credit card bill we realized that this was not the case. The membership fee for the day is 7 dollars and then you are charged for every minute you have the bike. This can get expensive fast. It is not made clear as to what the exact cost is for these bike rentals. Would not recommend this to anyone.
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/06/2012,"Return the bikes often to avoid High $$ Charge (if you can) Here is the deal, this program can be a little confusing the bikes are mostly located in the downtown area with some outlying such as Georgetown. You pay a membership fee which does not include usage. Usage charges add up if you do not return the bikes with 30 minutes, good luck trying to find an empty dock where to put the bike in popular area. You are probably better off renting from a bike shop as at least you will know how much you will pay, otherwise you may pay well over $100 a day if you do not return frequently."
DC,1,Negative,TripAdvisor,08/04/2012,"Very Confusing High Credit Card Charge! I though what a great program bike rentals conveniently located for $7 dollars a day, every community should have this. I carefully read the instructions and thought I had to return the bikes (2) before the 24 hours elapsed, which I did. I noticed a hold for a couple of hundred dollars which is understandable. But to my horror the money was deducted from my account because the bikes have to be returned every 30 minutes? This is not what I understood, I have requested a refund and will update when/if I get one..... :-("
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,07/05/2012,"So glad for a bike! Would do it again in a heartbeat! On the morning on our first day in DC, I pulled a muscle in my foot while running downstairs to catch the Metro, missed it anyways! Capital bike share saved me from having a hard day exploring the city. It was a hot day in the city, the bikes were a fun way to get everywhere quickly, easily, and without getting too tired out. As we whizzed by hot, tired, and miserable people of all ages I felt sorry for those who were walking especially the kids whose heads would turn longly. The wind blew in our sweaty faces and kept us a little cooler than the masses. My foot was fine, no pain, no swelling thanks to the bike rentals. It was convenient and fun. I would do it again in a heart beat!"
DC,5,Positive,TripAdvisor,06/15/2012,"Flexible, cheap and fun We saw these red bikes everywhere and asked our waitress at Founding Farmers. She raved about them. With stations all over the city, its a great way to get around on the cheap."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/27/2018,"It's not perfect, but I see Citibike as basically an essential public service that makes NYC more livable.I joined last summer and I'm so glad I did -- I get exercise, save $ on commuting, and, most importantly, save time getting from place to place. Yes -- sometimes there are app issues, or not enough bikes or docks available, or you get a bike with a bum seat, etc. It can't be perfect 100% of the time. But it's pretty freaking great. It's enabled me to see neighborhoods of this city I otherwise wouldn't, all on my own steam, faster than any other method would have allowed. It's enabled me to get to/from work in 10 minutes rather than 45 on the slow-as-molasses city bus. Given how terrible public transportation in NYC is these days (both subways and buses), it's been a lifesaver. - need to expand stations into northern Manhattan- need to pressure city to add more PROTECTED bike lines -- everywhere"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/02/2018,"Beware when signing up for the annual membership! Bad customer service with inflexible policies!! Seriously question your decision to sign up...It's rare that I post about a business as I'm in the customer service field myself, but this one deserves the warning blast. I signed up for Citibike because I got a job in New York. Exciting! I immediately got an annual membership after I received the offer as I was super excited to bike around this city and enjoy the flexibility of the drop 'n go service that city bike offers with their plethora of bike stations. I reckoned that even if I didn't use the 50+ rides required to offset the annual membership, the flexibility would be worth it. Now I'm seriously questioning my purchase...Unfortunately, I found out that my company offered a discount using a corporate code (great perk!). I submitted a request to Citi's customer service center through their site and received a stock response of ""Members have 14 days or less to cancel and receive a refund for their membersips."" Yes, that's the exact response. I didn't want to cancel my membership. I just wanted to get the discount applied and I was 3 days over the 14 day period. So I let it sit for a bit. Que sera, right? Well, not in this case. For some reason, the response irked me every time I saw a bike station (again, there are a ton of them...) so I called into their help center. I politely asked for an exception to the policy and they informed me that the policy was actually 30 days but I was now over that period so there was nothing that ""the system would allow them to do."" Being a customer service advocate, I calmly explained that they should be able to do a manager override. They talked to their supervisor and came back with the same response. When I asked to speak with the supervisor to explain, they declined. I offered some feedback amounting to Citibike gladly forgoing the small amount of money to keep a customer satisfied and bolster their reputation as a friendly, flexible company. I mean, it's founded on the concept of flexbility, right?! Not so much.In that final conversation, I discovered that their customer service is a call center that manages many bike share programs with a variety of directives that limit their ability override their system. How ridiculous is that?! A customer service management system that prevents you from offering good customer service? Unacceptable. Perhaps one of their agents will deem this public post worthy enough of a reasonable response and they'll make an exception to this 14 day nonsense that doesn't directly apply to my request. Citibike needs to stop treating their customers like numbers and start offering the service that's expected."

This used to be a town where if you're driving you drive down the street in peace. It was quite harmonious for New Yorkers. Then the darkness came. The citibike. Once they sit their asses on these cursed machines they ride down the streets disregarding every rule and law on the book. They mow down people on the sidewalk screaming for everyone to get out of the way. Ever since these things came to be it has been hell as a driver and a pedestrian and even a bi

It's Managing Director, whom I have spoken with twice is in the ball. His staff unfortunately is NOT.  I do nit write reviews, but Motivate, Citibike's operating company has a terrible with capital ""T"" customer service department. Two reps, SUMAYYA and KENDALL were passive aggressive, kept cutting off reception 4 x  phones. Please get your customer service reps name. Ask them to cure a simple issue. They hem and haw not to pass you thru to a Supervisor. This is a BLACK for Citibike. I seriously hope they clean up their act. It doesn't reflect well on the Bank. Having been a Bank president, when your customer service is shoddy, there is nothing you can say to the world to fix it up from a terrible phone presence. CITIBIKE get smart !!"

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/31/2019,"This program is a complete scam!  I signed up for Citi Bike yesterday and thus far have taken about four trips.  For my last trip, I docked the bike and even received a notification buzz in the app.  Then hours later, I received an email claiming my bike was still out.  I called immediately--the representative told me that she could put a temporary hold on the account while a technician went out to find the bike at the station.  And oh--if it's not found, a lost bike is $1200.  This ruined my entire weekend---within 24 hours of signing up, to possibly face a payment of $1200 because the bike didn't buzz in the system is beyond the pale.  I would NEVER recommend this program to anyone and in fact am waiting for tomorrow to call elected officials and consumer agencies about this ridiculous program!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/03/2018,I have not used any citi bike since mid October which was my first and last time. I was charged the general single ride and the late fee which was taken out of my account and I was totally fine with that. Saw there was a charge for citibike in Brooklyn on November 3rd---- I live in Manhattan. Made a claims and received and absurdly rude response. Luckily my bank protects me from random charges like this
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/02/2019,"Trap for tourists. Seemed like a good idea until I got charged over 160$ after I stopped using it even though I locked it up properly as directed. To top it off I sent a complaint to customer service and they never responded. Bikes are low quality too but hey, maybe you like to pedal harder than needed."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/18/2018,"BE WARNED. TOURIST SCAM. THIS COMPANY WILL FIND WAYS TO CHARGE YOU EXTRA FEES AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REFUND.I got charged $108 for a 20 minute bike ride, that was supposed to be $3. Because the bike was ""not properly docked"". I had rode The bikes several times and it was for sure locked. But the timer on my app kept running. If this happens to you CALL IMMEDIATELY and you might not get charged. I learned the hard way. Every time I rode the bikes, the timer was lagging on my phone, after I locked the bike, but I knew it would stop, because it always did.  So I thought nothing of it. And I knew the bike was locked because I had done it several times, and it beeped, and I could not pull the bike out. I thought, there's no way they can charge me because the bike is locked, and they must know that.Well a couple days, later I saw on my debit card a charge for $108. I thought, that sucks, but no problem, this will will be  be a quick phone call and refund. NOPE. 5 calls later, and a few emails to management and the best they could do was refund half the money. So they still basically stole $50 from me.I don't live in NYC, and I know another person who the same thing happened to. It must be very common and for a company to make more money off ""error charges"" then legitimate use of their service, that's not cool. They make it really easy to mess up, and they charge you, and then they blame you and say it's your fault.Don't get me wrong, the few times I used the bikes it was amazing, and super convenient, and super fun. But I feel that this is poor business practice. And they do not care about the satisfaction of their customers, because they are making so much money and have lost touch with the human to human interaction. I am happy to pay $50 for something. But paying $50 for nothing is not business. It's a scam."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/04/2018,"This company (Citi Bikes) is actively and knowingly engaging in deceptive practices and consumer fraud.I leased two bicycles for 24 hours at $12 per bicycle, totaling $24. I returned them after 1 hour and 26 minutes, yet I was being $26.13, plus another fee of $34.84, totaling $60.97.I contacted their customer service and they maintain they charges are valid, they did nothing wrong, and refuse to issue a full refund of the second charge. They say they charge an additional $4 per bicycle for every 15 minutes after the initial 30 minutes. Then what's the point of renting for a 24 hour period?I've filed a dispute with my card's bank, and will be filing complaints with government agencies.STAY AWAY!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/31/2018,"These bikes make it easy to get around quickly and there are many stations to pick from...The bikes aren't in the best shape - the tires are kind of flat, some of the seats are broken with stuffing coming out, and the brakes could use some tightening.The pay stations clearly outline the way the charges work - pay $12.00 and you can ride unlimited for 24 hours but you have to re-dock the bike every 30 minutes and get a new bike each time.We pay for two bikes - $24.00 for 24 hours. We ride for about 20 minutes, re-dock, walk around, find new bikes... And get charged again because the system doesn't recognize that we had already picked up bikes. Another $24.00.We dock the bikes in Brooklyn, they lock in place, and we go about our day. Wake up this morning and have a message from Citibike claiming one of the bikes hasn't been docked and we are getting charged for $1,200.00. We have tried calling customer service to rectify this issue, and their suggestion was to trek down to Brooklyn to re-dock the bike... Which may or may not be there anymore since their locking mechanism failed... Looks like others have had this problem. When the locks fail due to a power outage or because the mechanics fail, its the consumer who pays, not the merchant. Customer service is a joke, and they make you feel like you're the one who has ripped them off.Not worth it due to the lack of customer service and the pathetic rigamarole they put you through."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/11/2018,"Horrible experience with Citi bike. The $3 per ride is only on the app. If you rent from the station, there will be $13.07 per day.

NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/30/2018,"This review is for the ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP. If you live in Midtown and Lower Upper East/West, this service is simply a waste of money.  This is coming from a previously very loyal customer. As an NYC local, I originally loved using citi bike and looked forward to renewing my annual membership. However, recently that opinion has changed. I would give the service a 1-star rating for recent months, and a 4 or 5-star rating for the service they sold me a year ago. Bikes are rarely available in Midtown and Lower Upper East/West. Take a look at the attached pics. Several months ago, I could get a bike whenever and travel around the city with ease. Now, that is rarely the case. 4/5 times I look to use the bikes, there isn't a bike in a convenient location. If you live in Midtown or Lower Upper East/West then don't get the bikes. I'm not going to renew for another year and may try to get a refund on the last couple months, as the service hasn't been as advertised. No bikes to use. I'm now hoping Uber's jump bikes come into town. Another cost effective option for locals like myself."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/13/2018,"Ah, Citi bike...what an adventure this was. Read on if you want to hear about the stuff nightmares are made of. I hadn't heard of this method of commuting, but my boyfriend suggested we give this a go as we were in town for the weekend. 24 hour accessibility for just $12? Sign me up! I briefly read through the general rules on the kiosk--firmly dock your bikes at citi bike stations, rides are limited to 30 minutes per session, helmets are suggested, stay alert, follow the rules of traffic. But what really caught my eye was the fee for a stolen bike coming in at a whopping $1200?! I pity the fools who have incurred this charge. I decided right then and there that I'd guard this bike with my life and would fend off anyone who'd attempt to poach it from me. NO WAY would I become a victim of this insanity. The bikes are decently kempt and you have the option of toggling between 3 different gears as well as being able to adjust the height of the seat. The citi bike is also equipped with a cute little bell that I shamelessly abused during my rides--I had become a biking maniac from the thrill and laughter that ensued throughout the day. Really, it was intoxicating. All was well until we attempted to check out another two bikes. We received an error message only allowing a discharge of 1 bike as the other bike was 'still in use'. My heart plummeted. I'm pretty sure I blacked out.Something must have malfunctioned at our former docking station, because both my boyfriend and I were POSITIVE we pushed them in correctly. We phoned support and they gave us the ID for the bike in question and were instructed to head back to our previous station. We rushed back only to find that it was missing. Someone had checked the bike out. 30 minutes passed, 60 minutes passed, 90 minutes passed and still no notification of this wretched bike having been returned. At this point I had already accepted my fate and made peace with myself that this'll definitely be the most expensive bike ride I've ever had. We were notified 2.5 hours later that the bike had FINALLY been returned to a station. We wept and sang and jumped with joy. All in all, I had a pleasant experience considering the circumstances...if you have any love for your derriere, avoid riding on cobblestone. And if you have any love for your wallet, DOCK YOUR BIKE CORRECTLY."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/11/2018,Citi Bike has terrible customer service. I'll never buy a gift membership from them again. I bought it as a gift for my wife 3 weeks ago and she still hasn't been able to get her new membership. This in spite of all my unanswered email/help requests and phone calls. They also didn't extend her membership or give her a further discount for our troubles (something I asked for). Instead they just charged her for a new full priced membership which meant we had to make yet another call to them.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/22/2018,"I've been a CitiBike user for the past two years now, and am very fond of the bike share system. I've got the annual membership, which costs about $140/year if you get the $25 may discount and a further 10% discount for Citibank card holders. CitiBike has spread immensely over the past couple of years, having great coverage over most of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn and Queens now. You can use CitiBike for leisure/commuting and also for exercise; its heavy weight (45 lbs) makes it a good workout if you take it on an up-slope (Try the Manhattan Bridge). Just remember one golden rule: dock your bike in 45 minutes (or 30 minutes if you're not an annual member) and double check that you see the green light and hear the beep when you dock it (or that could be your most expensive bike ride ever at $1200!!!). The only issue I've had so far is not finding a bike when I really need one, but CitiBike is trying to improve that through their new Bike Angels program. Additionally, if you're at the end of your time-limit and really need to dock your bike at a station but there aren't any empty docks (or someone sniped you), don't just pass by! Go to the kiosk and they'll give you an extra 15 minutes to find a nearby station with a dock. Overall, I think the program is very well implemented and gets good maintenance, besides, CitiBike has some of the most fantastic customer service I've come across. They even shipped me a free replacement key when I lost mine, and are extremely courteous with most requests. I highly recommend giving it a shot!PS- a lot of people mention not knowing about the time limits/getting overcharged by CitiBike. In my opinion, CitiBike is extremely clear about the respective time limits and surcharges, and they're not in the business of fooling customers into paying more! :)"

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/30/2018,Bike went missing because of a malfunction and they said due to circumstances they would postpone the almost $600 bike replacement fee if I kept my membership active. As soon as I updated my info to keep it active BOOM they still charged me $577 for a piece of crap bike that is somehow missing. And now won't waive the fee whatsoever and it took them more than 25 days to even call back and tell me the can't waive it. TERRIBLE
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/27/2018,"If you are planning on using during commuting hours make sure you test it out first.  I joined two months ago and Iive at CPW and 85th.  There are never any bikes in a 10 block radius.  If you commute during off hours it's amazing.  After signing up i tried to have my membership cancelled because of the lack of bikes and their customer service is the WORST!!!  So it's great for off peak hours...unfortunately, i cannot even use the service."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/21/2018,"Total scam. Charged me an extra $52 because they weren't docked ""fast enough"" every 30 minutes. How is it considered a day pass if you have to run to another docking station every 30 minutes?After calling customer service I received a rude agent who must get these calls everyday asking for their money back. I will never use citi bike again. The bikes are also in horrible shape. Some brake, some don't. Some bells work, some don't. Total scam."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/06/2018,"Annual pass is a fantastic value.   Very easy to start cycling, or to re-start if you haven't been on a bike in years. Smartphone app shows available bikes at the many stations, and then after you check outs a bike, the app shows a map with bike lanes and available bike parking docks giving you lots of choice where to return your bike.   Do not be intimidated by cycling in Manhattan, just try it for a few blocks. Only weakness of CitiBike is it needs to expand to South Bronx up to Yankee Stadium and eastward in Queens to Flushing.    But it is already great in its current service area."

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/05/2018,First time using a citibike - used it to ride from WTC up to the Mega Bus station. I guess because my ride was a little over the half hour limit the charge went from $13 to $26. $26 for a single bike ride is absolutely insane. That is more than my megabus back to Philadelphia.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/21/2018,"Had good experiences over the summer but not yesterday. Got a day pass, ride for 30 minutes and then two hours later got a text that bike was not returned and being charged overages. Called and was told bike hadn't been locked properly. I heard a locking sound and saw red light. Assumed that meant it's locked. Apparently not.  No other warning until that text two hours later. Support said go back to station and put it back in. Went back to docking station, bike is gone. Called support again and found out I could be on the hook for $1200 to replace bike!  Don't forget: they have your credit card and will bill you for some idiot joyriding the bike around. Check reddit, it's even happened to people who did dock correctly."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/20/2018,"Citibike is great under two conditions. 1) you get a bike that actually runs smoothly and 2) there are bikes actually available at the docking stations near you. I started using citibike religiously despite often riding bikes where you had to exert 110% of your energy to barely move. Lately my new issue has been no available bikes. They poorly redistribute bikes in my area and when I reached out I was give a generic response that didn't even address the issues I brought up. If citibike truly wants to hold onto to its customers, they need to more regularly service their bikes and use the data they collect in their app to appropriately distribute bikes in high traffic areas."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,02/18/2018,"While Citi Bike can be a convenient way to get from point A to point B, it is overpriced, and not always available.Citi has nice bikes which ride well and look trendy!However, I can only pay for increments of 24 hours or more. Thus if I just want to ride, say, 10 blocks in one day, I still have to pay a fee or $12 plus a fee (i.e. $13.07). There is no option to ride for, say, only 30 minutes.In terms of local availability, it's nice that there is a bicycle bank on my corner, and in numerous other locations, but there are seldom bikes actually in the bank nearest to my apartment. This can be inconvenient at time.I think this system can be improved by allowing other companies to compete in bike sharing , allowing smaller time periods of rental, and assuring bikes are available more often.Thank you Citi, but there is room for improvement."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/04/2017,Works like any other city bike rental BUT there needs to be more stations..... DC has me spoiled..... why they don't have any at Coney Island is beyond me. Also their day pass for $12.00 bucks as long as you riding the bike checkout within 30 minutes is lame. I'm suppose to enjoy myself not watching a stupid clock and with the stations being far and few in between there is not a guarantee I will find a docking station in time. If you are riding near the water front go for it but I may just bring my own bike the next time I'm in NYC definitely if I am there for the beach.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/30/2018,"These bikes are in really bad shape! This week so far I've rented two damaged ones. Bad wheels, bad coordination and horrible shifts! I don't know how often they perform maintenance on these bikes, but it seems that they are not doing the best job. Looking forward for more bicycle sharing systems in NYC thar are way much better when it comes to the overall operations and maintenance of their main product, a bicycle."

I was charged twice for two rides that, as shown on my app, were both under 30 minutes. Small issue, right? After calling customer service, the lady I spoke to (whose name I will not disclose here) was confused, put me on hold twice, did not know how to use the actual app herself, and then HUNG UP ON ME. TWICE. I can read the billing charges myself and deduce that something is wrong- that's why I called your customer service. Instead of doing anything on the phone, she told me to screenshot and email my issue. OF COURSE I would have done that in the first place had I known an actual human being would not only be useless, but rude!Issue still not resolved and disrespected by a customer service rep. Will NEVER be using CitiBike again and you shouldn't either!"

Killing off bike lanes abruptly to make room for bus stops and parking spaces makes for dangerous bike commuting. As for the citibike service, removing (or increasing) the 30 minute limit for a rider who has hired for 24 hours would be logical."

There are stations right by the met, Guggenheim, and Natural History Museum so by the time I was done I had been on a pretty solid bike tour :)I'm now a happy member and feel bad for people that don't get bike share. Four stars for sightseeing on a bike but 5 stars because it helps the environment!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/05/2018,"Citi Bike is a great service to the city and tourists!  We used this system as tourists to sight see and travel the city.  This is the best way to see Manhattan!  At just $12/day pass (which equals 24 hours of biking), it's an incredible deal over renting bikes.  The only catch is you must dock every half hour.  This didn't bother us as we had several destinations where we docked and walked around or ate somewhere.  The bikes are well maintained and the app is simple to use.  You can route a trip using the app's map.  You can adjust the seat easily and the bike comes equipped with a bell, kickstand and many speeds.  NYC has wonderful bike trails like the Hudson River greenway!  Also several streets have dedicated bike lanes either separated from traffic or in the side. Our experience with NYC drivers is that they're mindful of and accustomed to driving with bikers.  I never felt like I was in jeopardy, even though we didn't rent or wear helmets and rode alongside cars on our day trip.  (Citi Bike does not offer helmets- this is okay with me)My only suggestions to Citi Bike:1.  If a docking station is full, allow extra time to get to another station before charging. 2.  Update your app to include the daily history.  I'd love to know how many miles and minutes we biked total."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/09/2018,"Bought an all day pass, it lasted 2 hours... :/ just when we really needed a bike and finally found a station with bikes, are citibike card stopped working. The citibike workers said ""sorry"".  :( ...also, I rented the bike from a citibike worker who told me I would be able to ride the bike as much as I liked during the 24hr period, in 30 minute increments. We used the bikes for a total of 1 hour!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,02/28/2018,The two bikes we rented ran great Plenty of stations to pick up and drop offI just wish you didn't have to Redocked your bike every 30 minutesBest way to get around the city
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,01/06/2018,"Great way to get around Brooklyn (& NYC for that matter).Only hassle would be that the bike stations are limited to Northwest side of Brooklyn so probably not good if you want to bike to Coney Island.I used a Visa credit card and had no hassles.Bike seats and handlebars can be adjusted for height by pulling lever out, then raising/lowering seat, screwing lever to tighten and then closing the lever."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/10/2018,"I love City bikes!!! I use it all the time. I just would love even better if the rides were 45 minutes instead of 30 minutes. It takes me 50 minutes to ride to my job, and It's crazy in NYC to find an spot just to drop your bike off. With traffic and high demand on bikes you gotta be very careful when you are running out of time to drop the bike off. If there's no bikes at your closest drop off location to change bikes it's just hectic."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/11/2018,WARNING!!! YOU WILL BE FINED $1200 if your bike doesn't dock properly (even if you get a light and dock it properly and the dock fails). Just keep this in mind when making your decision - the CitiBike customer service doesn't care what the rationale was for the bike not being returned. You are liable regardless of the reason. Worst customer service ever - filing a police report doesn't help.
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,07/02/2018,"Very good when it works, but they are unhelpful when it does not.  The app failed to unlock a bike multiple times.  The customer service department said there is nothing they could do.  I was stranded without a bike.  Also, they often run out of bikes at key times.Citi bike commented and asked if I had the latest app.  As I mentioned, I spoke to the customer service people several times.  I had the latest app, latest operating system and a new phone.  Unfortunately, the Citi app failed and the customer service people basically said too bad, but there is nothing they could do (politely). It is disappointing when a service fails to perform and the provider makes the consumer suffer.  Sooner or later there will be competition."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/18/2018,"Be advised--seems like a great service until you actually use the bike. I thought using Citi Bike last weekend would be a fun way to see New York City. I purchased a ""day pass"" for $13. Nowhere did it explain to me that the day pass was only good for unlimited 30-minute rides in a 24-hour period. Instead, as seems logical, everything pointed to the idea that I could use the Citi bikes as many times as I liked for 24 hours. Wrong, apparently. For four rides totaling less than four hours, I was charged not just the $13 but an additional $35 in ""overtime fees"" because I kept the bikes out for an hour or 1.5 hours at a time. Citi Bike's ""day pass"" is only good when you ride for 30 minutes, dock the bike, and then get a new bike. If you don't, expect additional fees charged to your credit card automatically. When I called Citi Bike to complain, the agent refused to give me even a partial refund.Owners claim that the signage is clear on this issue. First of all, it's not, as evidenced by this website alone (see numerous additional Yelp reviews in the last year complaining about the same issues). Second, if Citi Bike were actually concerned about its customers misunderstanding pass options, it would indicate on its app when overcharges in the absurd amount of $4/15 minutes were being invoked, so that riders could dock the bikes immediately. Seems to me like a clear profiteering scheme. I will never use Citi Bike again. Buyer beware."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,11/23/2016,"Got a day pass from the Citi Bike app, and checked out my first bike here at Central Park South in front of a fancy hotel. As of my trip, a day pass was $12, and you got 30 minutes of riding time, before you get charged an additional $4/15 min. Make your trips short, and plan with the app. The bikes were mostly semi-workable. I checked out a total of 9 bikes, the majority of them had some sort of shifting problem. One had brakes that would stick, and make you feel like you're pedaling the Alps. The bikes are a bit on the heavy side, but they're sturdy and comfortable with wide, adjustable seats, and a bell to alert pedestrians that you're coming through. Move it or lose it! The app makes the whole experience much better. It shows you where you are, where the nearest stations are, etc. Gotta get the app."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/01/2018,Fun to use and convenient.  We rode for about 3 miles but I can see myself going a lot further and seeing more of the city.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/03/2018,"Very convenient and easy to use. I also really liked that the total time, distance, and calories burned were tracked!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/12/2018,"My ass hurts on the seats while riding the bike. It needs softer cushion. I hate riding in the streets when the lanes run out. I get anxiety thinking I may get hit in the street by a bus, riding with the traffic. I almost cussed this nosey lady out for thinking she could question my ability to even afford to ride the bike for f*cks sake. My friend and I had a blast roaming NYC late at night together. Quite an adventure. I missed bike riding since I was a kid. And our upper leg quads were in pain but a good kind of pain. Viva la NYC. I love citibike!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/03/2018,"BEWARE!!! RIPOFF!!! I signed up for a ""Day Pass"" for $13.00 for a crappy three speed lunker that weighs a ton and has terrible brakes, I thought that was a little expensive, but I splurged to go for a ride for an hour.  MY BILL WAS $75!!!  Yes, the ""Day Pass"" is no such thing.  That ""Day Pass"" just allows you to unlock the bike and ride 30 minutes -- and then they charge you about $4 every 15 MINUTES for use after that!!!  YIKES!!  What sense does that make?  I rode from Brooklyn to SoHo and docked my bike with a very forceful, loud, deliberate shove.  Turns out, even though I rammed it into the docking station, it didn't dock.  Because it didn't dock, the charges kept running.  An hour later, I receive an email that I am racking up charges at $4 every 15 minutes.  That's when I first realized Citi Bikes charges a small fortune every quarter hour, not $13/day.  I call, and in a frustrating help conversation, am told I have to go back and re-dock--all the while I am accruing charges more than of $16/hour.  If I don't, they'll charge me $400 for a lost bike!!!!  No Bull!!!  I eventually take a subway downtown from Central Park back to SoHo to re-dock, and by then they bill me for $75!!!!   Lots of other reviewers have had the same unfortunate experience.Do you know what a great racing bike you can rent for $75/day?  I do--a $4000 Specialized, Trek or Cannondale with carbon frame and Shimano Ultegra components, plus shoes and a helmet and tools.  For a whole day, not just a few hours.  Fortunately, my card had expired, otherwise I would have been forced to pursue credit card dispute resolution for deceptive billing practices.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK -- THERE IS NO DAY PASS!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/11/2018,"First time using CitiBike, and had the BEST day with it. So easy to use, very cost friendly, and fun! Rode around Manhattan and Brooklyn!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/04/2018,It was very convenient. The inly problem is at one station there were only three bikes and I couldn't adjust the seat because it was stuck so I had to walk a few blocks to another station to get a bike.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/18/2017,"This is a review of my annual membership. I joined as soon as they expanded to my neighborhood 2 years ago, as a station opened right across the street from me! I used citibike frequently, and for the low cost to be a member it was totes worth it. I'm interested in joining again now that they're expanding even deeper into Brooklyn. The bikes were generally well-maintained, and not a ton of issues finding an empty dock to park it. But taking away a star because there were times either no bikes were available when the app said there was or all docks were full, the latter which made it inefficient for a work commute. So I could only use it when I wasn't under strict time constraints.I agree with day pass users that 30 minutes is not adequate. Members get 45, so that was a sufficient amount of time for me. But perhaps they can extend day pass use to 45 and member usage to an hour. When I used citibike for the very first time on a day pass, it was clear to me that there was a refundable deposit and a 30 minute rule, so not quite sure what other people are seeing. But if these many people are having issues, the company may want to make it clearer."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/01/2017,I will never ever rent a bike from this company again. I was charged a late fee that cost more than what I signed up for.  Very misleading. Customer service is nonexistent.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/15/2018,"The past few weeks experiences with this company have lead to me feeling like I need to share and review. CitiBike was a great idea. My husband and I live in midtown and decided to each get the yearly subscription and have Citibike be our main form of transportation within Manhattan. This was our choice and has ended up, in hindsight, our huge mistake. There are NEVER any bikes available. We have about 6+ docks around our neighbourhood and no matter if it is a weekday (and I'm talking any time of day, not specifically peak hour) or weekends, there are generally, like 90% of the time, no bikes. There's often 2 at the dock but they're always ones that don't work. I've missed multiple important events, meetings, classes, interviews etc. Despite giving myself extra time and factoring in having to hunt for a bike. This afternoon, there was 1 single bike left at one single dock near me. I couldn't get it out with my app code, or with my credit card at the kiosk. After spending way too long on the phone with CitiBike Support, I was just told they couldn't help and to find another bike...there were no other bikes within walking distance...and, I missed my meeting. I get it, getting the Citibike subscription was a choice. But, after paying for a yearly subscription and continual disappointments and a request for a refund which was denied and the only thing I seem to be getting from the customer service reps is ""We will submit your complaint. ""There's nothing else we can do. "". Do these complaints actually get submitted? I'm unsure as there seems to have been no change over the months to the distribution and relocation of the bikes which Citibike keeps promising. The only thing I can think to do is let other people know the deal before they fork out the cash. Citibike maybe a great idea if you want a leisurely tourist-like bike ride along the Hudson on a brisk Fall Sunday with no time constraints and the willingness to walk and wait and hunt down a bike.  If so, it's totally worth your time and money. But, honestly, the thing it was designed for...a mode of transport for residents of the city...it fails at. Greatly. It does not provide reliable transportation. It's continually a gamble and more often than not, the customer ends up the loser. The missed and now rescheduled meeting from today is probably going to be detrimental to my future work. Save yourself the money, the time, the stress of always being late (or not even showing up at all) and use the not always reliable MTA...that way more reliable (yep, I'm saying this) than Citibike."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/17/2018,Worst experience. Overpriced service with hidden fees.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/25/2018,"A good idea in theory, with terrible execution.I've been an annual subscriber for a couple years, but this is the end. I'm cancelling my account, and my wife is cancelling her account. Telling my family to follow suit.The bikes have been falling into disrepair and the problem continues to get worse. Most of the time, there are no bikes when I need them to get to work and no bikes when I need them to get home from work. They do a poor job of moving the bikes to empty racks, so most of the time especially during rush hours, the service is useless.Finally tonight, the last straw. I was lucky enough to actually get a bike today. I docked the bike where I always dock it and the bike got stuck in the dock. Now tonight I get home and I check the app and it says I've had the bike for 10 hours. I call customer service they want to claim I stole their precious bike and ""there's nothing we can do"". So I go back over there in the middle of the night (I should be in bed, I work for a living) and sure enough the bike is still there. Sitting in their broken and powerless dock. I call customer service again, and so now they are ""escalating"" it, whatever that means. I'm done. Worst service ever. Buy your own bike, before they slap $1200 stolen bike fees on your credit card. $1200 for these pieces of rusty disgusting garbage. I wouldn't pay $12 for one of these.And to make matters worse, they raise the price on you every year!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/07/2018,"Had a great time! Although there are many docks available throughout the city, be aware of time if you're renting for a day since some docks will be full. It's a heavy bike so I wouldn't recommend it for the street if you aren't street savvy. Enjoy a casual bike ride."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/03/2017,"UPDATE! Woke up to find I am being charged more than $30 for what I thought was $12 for Day Pass for 24 hour rental....Omfg...I could have bought an unlimited Metro card for that!!!! ---- Original Review-----Love love these clunky lil blue bikes!! They are not super hi tech hybrid bikes, just so perfect for cruising around. I decided against trying to get to 3 different places in an afternoon by train, and Citi Bike just happened to be right there -- problem solved. October in NYC, in a tshirt, riding a bike around Queens, yes, please! I recommend you eye your bike up and down before unhooking it, and check that it has a rear mud flap! If you do a day pass, currently $12, you can dock your bike and then get another anytime during you 24-hr period which means you don't need to lug it up the stairs into your apartment. They could do a better job of explaining this feature (dock and undock multiple times) bc it is a big reason to rent and ride.I recommend the Citi Bikes 100%!! Enjoy your lil bluet!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/08/2018,First time user. As an avid road cyclist used to skinny tire bikes I found the bikes comfortable and easy to use. We went 7 miles around nyc on bike paths and it's the only way to get around.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/30/2016,"I got a free day pass, so my boyfriend and I biked to Brooklyn, switched out bikes, walked around, got a new bike, went to brunch and it was a blast! The process was easy and efficient and the directions for using my pass were easy to follow. I wish the time limit was longer; it was only 30 minutes, but I know Citi Bike is usually 45 minutes anyway. I'm excited for the next time we use Citi Bike!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/02/2018,"Most fun I've had in NYC riding through the city! So exhilarating, will definitely do it again."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/11/2016,"I didn't pick up from this location, but this was the only page on yelp? Anyway, I thought the bikes were great for short rides under 2 miles. There are a surprisingly large amount of bike lanes in nyc. More than I thought. I used the app to find the docking stations and paths. It was fun and made me feel like a real new yorker. I had to check my phone at every light to make sure I was going the right way, but nobody has to know that. Odd thing was I got asked for directions twice while I was on the bike. I was like uhm I'm on a bike, can't stop to give you directions and also I don't know where I'm going. :P I've used these shared bikes once before in London and it was terrible. I remember it being really hard to take off the dock and put back in, but these were really easy. Maybe because I've been working out hah. I didn't have any issues with the code or docking. I had to adjust the seats, but it was easy. The one downside is the handlebars were all super sticky. ew. The bikes are obviously also meant for short distance commuting. They're quite clunky and slow, but that's why I said 2 miles max, maybe 3. It is kind of like riding a tank - you can ride over almost anything. Nice to not have to worry about the tires getting a flat.It's also $12 for a day pass. That's rather expensive. Much more than the subway. I was in it for the scenery and to say I rode a bike around new york."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/22/2018,This was my 2nd experience with citi bike but 1st time actually riding the bike and it was smooth sailing. I originally thought it might be a lil complicated to rent the bike but it wasn't and I was able to get to my destination in no time. The bike are a bit heavier in comparecen to my own bike but that's all about self adjusting so no biggie. Totally recommend if your using it for a quite ride. If your trying to used the bike all day it might get a little overbearing to have to check in you bike every 30 min. That my experience with a 24. Hour rental.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/01/2016,"Fantastic service for short bike rides or errands. We decided to take a bike ride on a Sunday early eve, and while my son has his own bike I do not so this was wonderful.We did not have time limitations or need to get another bike so we didn't have an issue with bike docking stations being empty etc. However given you can't ride a long stretch going downtown on the east river I think the west side or Central Park biking is probably better for that or for tourists. I was not comfortable allowing my son to ride in the bike lanes on the streets but still we had a nice bike ride and I definitely plan to use this service again. Despite as my son pointed out some elderly looking at us like we were walking camels across the upper east side streets my son and I both loved the bike ride."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/27/2018,"As a yearly membership rider in Manhattan, I love it and hate it. When everything works as it's supposed to it's a fantastic service. More often than not, however, the docks are broken, or the bikes need maintenance. The docking device is a nightmare: very touchy devices. 30% of the time the dock won't accept the bike no matter how many techniques you use. No wonder you see so many people SLAMMING the bikes into the docks. The docks don't recognize or accept my card half the time...light turns red instead of green.  Distribution of bikes is really bad...not nearly enough of them in the most popular stations.  Like New York itself, the equipment is in disrepair, dirty, run-down...and the service/reliability is spotty.  I only wish I had an option. I'd switch to the competition."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/04/2018,"Citi bike has unacceptable customer service. Accused my little brother of being a liar when we had 4 witnesses. Who cares tho, the bank sided with my brother."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/13/2016,"For us, using the Citi Bike bike sharing scheme was a learn-as-you-go process.A few things: *adhere to 30 minute limit per bike ride (dock your bike, and if you like it, wait two mintues & re-rent it, or grab another one), or risk incurring a 'late' fee*wait for the wee green light to flash on docking bay before pulling out your bike (I found grabbing the back of the bike seat, lifting up and out to be most successful)*try to snag a newer bike (easily ID'ed by bike light on the back fender) as those tend to be in better nick & have a more 'user friendly' gear shifter*docking stations in commuter areas may be devoid of bikes at prime commute times*download Citi Bike app in order to find the nearest docking station near you*use the Citi Bike app to rent a bike remotely, so that you can just rock up to a docking station, grab a bike & goWe did not run out of bike paths/lanes to use as many Manhattan avenues now have dedicated bike lanes for you to cruise in relative safety along. We also availed ourselves of the Hudson River Greenway and the path along the East River with our Citi Bikes. Time it out right, and one is able to find a docking station within the 30 minute time frame. This takes a bit of planning, but is not impossible to achieve. Among the areas accessible to us via Citibike were Midtown, SoHo, W. Village, E. Village, Hell's Kitchen, the UWS, the South Ferry area, and Chelsea. I have to say that not always needing to rely on the bus and subway during our stay was a treat."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/04/2016,"***NOTE - these are NOT FOR TOURISTS! Unlike other major cities - this is a bike sharing program for residents. BEWARE- Using bikes for more than 30 minutes results in A HUGE overage charge. We went to a kiosk at Central Park, read the instructions, popped in our credit card and assumed our charge would be about $50. My credit card bill arrived with $80 in overages AND a miscalculated time amount for one of the three bikes - which we used simultaneously. Citi ought to be ashamed. There is one vague line on the kiosk about the 30 minute limit - which clearly lacks details. So, buyer beware.  I just called and - after complaining long enough - I was finally told I could submit a claim for a refund - which I did receive promptly."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/25/2017,"Five stars all the way -- for the simple fact that I think bike sharing programs should be in every neighborhood in every country in the world.Things I love:1.) The app. It's the greatest. Find a bike near you and find an open dock near your destination. Can't get much better than that. Also, it keeps track of your usage time so you'll know when you need to find a dock ASAP to avoid extra charges. I also love that it keeps track of the miles biked and calories burned. I always feel so good about my ride after.2.) Biking around a city really allows you to see it from a different angle. I normally avoid Times Square at all costs, but riding through it at 3 a.m. on a warm summer night is just magical.3.) You don't have to worry about investing in an expensive lock and praying that someone doesn't break it anyway and steal your bike.4.) You can have a bike at (almost) anytime and (almost) anywhere you want/need it.5.) MUCH faster than walking6.) You don't have to store your bike in your tiny Manhattan apartment (which I did for many years in my 250 sq. ft. studio, before Citibike came into existence)7.) You don't have to pay to store your bike somewhere if you don't have room in your apartment8.) Much better exercise than standing/sitting on the subway or in the back of a car share9.) SO MUCH FREEDOM. Need to go cross-town? Just a few blocks? Across a bridge? Want a romantic nighttime ride through Central Park? A sunny afternoon along the Hudson River? Do it all. It's all glorious.10.) No fuel required.11.) No exhaust.12.) Cost-effective vs. subway/cabNo matter how in love I am with bike share programs, improvements can always be made.Some suggestions:1.) There needs to be more stations and more bikes. By now, Citibike folks should know the flow of riders around the city and understand where more docks and bikes are needed -- especially for the commuter flow of downtown vs uptown.2.) Simply, not having stations/bikes above 110th Street in Manhattan or anywhere in the Bronx at all is just...well...not very inclusive. If you can move across the Hudson to Jersey City and Hoboken, you can cross the uptown threshold of Manhattan.3.) While you're at it, expand above Hoboken as well. The river towns in Jersey are thirsty for something like this.4.) While I've seen infrastructure for cycling greatly increase over the past decade in New York, there still is a lot more to be done. More protected bike lanes are a must. Driver/pedestrian/cycling safety classes -- or at the very least, information in the form of campaign ads near docking stations or on social media -- should be readily available. The amount of motorists and pedestrians who don't pay attention and put cyclists' lives in danger is astounding. I would say I nearly get hit by a car at least once every time I ride, while in a bike lane. That should not happen.5.) Please tend to broken bikes faster. There's nothing more annoying that needing a bike and seeing a rack with 4 of them that are not in use because something is wrong with them -- and having to wait 15 minutes for another biker to come and dock a good one.6.) Consider adding some feature to the app that would calculate how much energy is saved (electricity and/or oil/gas usage and emissions) per ride, like you do with the miles biked/calories burned. It would be great to track how much biking is helping the earth -- and I would think it would be a great use as a marketing tactic on your end to entice more ridership and to get more bikes on the roads!7.) Perhaps add a map feature to the app so you can map your ride before you take off -- and so you can more easily find the closest available docking station. Would be great if it could update in real time so a biker doesn't get stuck heading toward a station that has become full since the trip began.8.) Make day passes cheaper and have weekly passes as well. For the price of the 3-day Citibike pass, I got a full week of unlimited bike share in Paris.As you can tell, I think a lot about bike share programs. On a trip to Paris two years ago, my partner and I used only their bike share (called Velib) to get around Paris. No cabs, no subways (only bus rides to/from the airport). Transit is usually not an attraction on a trip but this was the best experience we ever had. We got to see so much more of Paris than we would have if we were underground or just in the back of a cab and got to know Paris intimately and for a fraction of the cost of what other transit options were available. I remember how controversial Citibike was in the years it was in its planning stages and when it was first implemented. But I am grateful for the folks and activists who pushed through and made this happen. After seeing so many European cities that heavily rely on bicycle travel, and how effective it is on so many levels, it's a no-brainer that it can be that way here, too. Biking is the future!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/17/2018,Good experience for exploring neighborhood by Citi Bike. Perfect stations locations. Good solution for ride road plan.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/27/2018,Love the Citi bikes! Great for getting around the city! Only downside is not enough bike Lanes!
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,02/22/2018,"Amazing! Easy to use machines. Gets you around the city quickly. Fair price ($12/24hours). Great for nice, warm days in NYC Like yesterday (02/21/18, 70+ degrees in the day time). Only wish the amount of time between the required docking was longer (it's currently 30 or 45 minutes between docking, depending on if you have an account and your membership type. The $12/24 hours mentioned earlier is the ""non-membership option. There is also a 3-day option for non-members). Also, it would've been great to have more docks near Manhattan's water fronts. I was riding along the Hudson (west side) and might have enjoyed that a little more if I had been able to stop and take in the view. I was terrified of overage charges."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/21/2018,"I've used Citi Bike often around Brooklyn with no major issues.  But what a nightmare using it in Manhattan.   I spent 30 minutes looking for a bike station in Midtown and Chelsea that had available bikes, and it wasn't until I literally caught up with the Citi repair truck that was unloading new bikes that I finally was able to rent one.  And when I tried to return it in the Lower East Side I spent another 20 minutes going to FOUR stations looking for an open bike dock. Which ironically again was the result of catching up with the repair truck that was TAKING bikes out of the docks for tuneups. And at least 3 of the stations' credit card scanners in Manhattan wouldn't even read my credit card, which is a new card. The night culminated with the final blow, a station full of bikes gave me a message on the kiosk saying ""We apologize, rentals are not available at the moment."" Extremely frustrating series of events for a company as ""reputable"" as Citi. All in all I wasted about 45 minutes throughout the day going from station to station trying to find either A) an available bike, B) an open dock, or C) a scanner that would actually read my card.  Citi Bike offers a measly $6 coupon for customers who did not have a great experience, but an actual refund would be more on par with the level of Customer Service they claim to have.  I don't recommend wasting your $12 on this frustrating experience."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/10/2017,Some of the bikes are really hard in operating.Stations are always empty in a lunch time.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/12/2018,"This company completely ruined mine and my husband's wedding anniversary. We planned to rent bikes for the day and head to Central Park for a romantic picnic that we had reserved and already paid for. We were at the rental docking station. I entered my password. It didn't unlock my bike. Instead it unlocked someone else's bike. We called customer service and were told we were stuck. I couldn't get a bike until mine was returned. I was financially responsible if it was returned late or not at all. We missed our picnic, had to pay for an Uber on top of all charges being assessed by the person who got my bike at my expense. In all, instead of making our lives easier, citi bike ruined what was supposed to be an amazing anniversary date in which my husband wanted to romantically re propose to me."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,11/17/2014,"So I was thinking of renting a bike....then thought it was going to be too cold.  Then came to town and saw the citibikes eeeeeverywhere.  Both the docking station and the bikes.  And then the green bike lanes.  Ooh, I had to try them out.To start the process...you use your credit card and theres a number of disclaimers, questions, etc you go through on a computer screen.  I was really totally only looking to ride them once or twice so I settled on the one day $9.95 pass.To me, the system is a little confusing, and i feel theres a little bit of ""buyer beware"" to be ""aware"" of.  There's a $101 (or $105? Something like that) hold put on your card automatically (they tell you this-- but still.) You get a code and have five minutes to use the code on the bike of ur choice.  I fully realize i may**occasionally** be technologically deficient but I felt it was a little hard to figure all this out quickly.  There's obviously no one at these kiosks so i was on my own trying to unlock the bike.The ride:  i checked the air pressure on a few bikes before i chose one and overall it was ok.  Personally I'm used to leaning over to reach the handle bars on a bike-not sitting upright so the whole balancing and turning felt a little awkward to me.  The brakes felt like they could use tightening and as I road the front tire made a noise like a frog every couple seconds:(.  But it was ok for my purposes.However...30 minutes go really quick, and I soon found myself concerned about time.  You have  to return each bike every 30 min (God, I think -- so many rules.) Could they make it every 60 minutes you have to return them? Oy! 30 min is NOT much time to ride.Returning the bike was a little awkward... it was locked but took a minute and honestly the process made me a little nervous.Its very likely that this is one of those things you have to do a bunch of times to get the hang of.  For me, it was less expensive and more convenient than trying to go to a place (store) that rents out bikes, so I'm sure it seems like I'm complaining about a lot of the aspects of citi bikes.  Still, it seems like there's room for improvement."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/05/2018,"First time using it. It's an easy service to use, and I appreciate not having to worry about locking up my bike."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/07/2018,We rented 2 bikes for 24 hours at what we thought was $12 per bike per day and they ended up charging us $82. What they don't tell you is that you have to return the bike every 30 minutes. Why have 24 hour rentals if that is the case? I won't ever be using this service again.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/04/2018,Love it!!! Such a great way to see the city AND so much faster (and cheaper then a cab) when public transport isn't in the right spot. So many convenient locations to drop off the bike when you're done !!! Definitely buying an annual membership.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/22/2016,My friend rent the bike from the street shop for 20$ for 7 hours ( which is Ok) But on the end it was always nose to goooo back all the way to take his bike whenever we where stoping somewhere to take a walk)Citybank - mobilebike!!)
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,02/09/2016,"I was an inaugural member, and I also signed up for a second year just to support the service.I gave it up eventually since I didn't have a need for it. That second year, I think I only used it less than 10 times since I was staffed on projects that were directly next to subway entrances.It's awesome when it works, but getting a bike and finding an open dock is a very frustrating experience if you work in one of the popular areas like Midtown.  I hope the service gets better, but I won't be renewing my membership again."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/22/2018,"It's a great system, I just wish we didn't have to dock them in certain places. Something I have to walk around to find a dock to return it."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,01/20/2018,It is a brilliant way to get around NYC and so much fun! Bikes are in a very good condition and easy to navigate. The app is extremely helpful to locate the available bikes and docks.

We had initially planned to just cross the park on bikes because it was faster than waiting for he cross town bus, but then had so much fun we decided to take an extended ride back through Central Park. The bikes were easy to rent, use, and dock. I highly recommend this for your next Sunday fun day adventure :)"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/06/2018,My experience with Citi Bike was great! I rode around the city for hours! The text letting me know how much time I had left was very helpful. I definitely would recommend city bike to my friends as Different way to get around the city.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/03/2017,"DO NOT USE SO BAD, SO UNACCOMMODATING SO RUDE AWFUL PEOPLE DO NOT USE.The worst possible experience you can imagine. DO NOT USE CITI BIKE. These people are nasty and extremely unaccommodating. We used Citi Bike for the first time this weekend and thought we docked the bikes in the way we were supposed to, then got a late fee because apparently we did not dock the bikes correctly. We checked, the bikes were still there and there was a problem with the system. The customer service on the phone was SO RUDE AND SO BAD, and did not offer help. This is THE WORST organization. For an organization that louds itself on affordable public transit this was a disgusting abuse. DO NOT USE CITIBIKE THEY ARE AWFUL"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/22/2018,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE & UNFAIR BUSINESS MODELFirst off, 30 minutes per trip is way too short. If I pay for a day pass than I should be able to keep a bike out for the whole day if I want. Especially if I get unlimited rides for free. It was a pain and completely pointless to keep docking every 30 minutes only to take a new bike out each time.Second, one of the times that I docked a bike, it gave me the green light saying that I had docked it properly but my app said that I was still out on a ride. I triple checked the dock and even had someone else ensure that it was locked in there. The app says that if I have trouble like this to call customer support. Note that, I can't take a new bike out or do anything until the trip ends. So I was forced to call only to find out that no one is available and I had to leave a message. I tried again several times until I got someone who was awful. She said that no one could come out and look at the dock and would not believe me when I told her that I swore the bike was locked. She wouldn't help me until I went back and double check the dock. Even more insane logic, she was going to hang up and have me call back after I checked it again - why not just believe me then?! So instead, I made her stay on the line. I wasn't about to wait 20 min to get her back on the phone or repeat the process with  someone else - surprise surprise, when I checked it again, it was locked. For all she knew I could have been pretending to check it. She should have believed me when I said I was sure - I also had a witness vouch for me. If they don't commission people to pop round and help you in person then they need to be more believing of the customer. It's not my fault their dock didn't notify the app. After an hour of convincing her, I was FINALLY free to resume my trip. Thankfully I was out got a leisurely ride but what if I legit had to be somewhere?!Then, I got an email 3 hours later saying that my trip was still open and that I might get charged. I emailed them back asking if this was still a problem bc I had spoken to someone on the phone and they said they resolved it. They took care of this as well but still very frustrating.I will not be using citibike again if this is the type of customer service I have to deal with when something goes wrong."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/26/2018,I LOVE CITI BIKE! I bought a day pass to explore Brooklyn and it made my day perfect! So easy to use! Will definitely recommend to friends!

NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/29/2018,"Like every bikeshare system, it isn't without its problems - but overall the Citi Bike system is well run (especially considering how extensive the network is) and most bikes tend to be in reasonable shape"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/01/2017,"I love the idea of bike sharing but their implementation is terrible and borderline criminal.  You have to check the bikes in every 30 minutes or they start charging you $16 an hour (on top of the pass price). This adds a totally unnecessary element of stress and urgency. If you (inevitably) don't click the bike all the way into the station, they continue charging you indefinitely. Customer service is totally unhelpful and expects you to travel across the city to find their bike in the middle of the night??!!! I'm pretty sure they make most of their money off of this kind of credit card company-esque bullshit. AVOID."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/28/2017,Wonderful ride from Williamsburg to DUMBO to Brooklyn Bridge! Got the 24 hr pass and there were many stations along the way. At some point we had to call customer service and they were very speedy to answer and help out.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/18/2018,It would be great if there were bikes available. At 6am you would think there are tons of bikes outside the penn station area. But not one available. I walked 1/2 way to work before I finding  an available bike. Waist of money for me.
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/21/2017,"Having to dock the bike every 30 minutes is beyond annoying. What's a day pass if you can't have it for a whole day? Having to stop and dock it makes your travel time longer and you're constantly worried you're going to go over time. The bikes also only have 3 levels of resistance and even the highest one doesn't have enough, so if you're going up a hill you really have to pedal. I know these aren't top notch bikes but they should consider upgrading in the future. They should also try and get bikes that are lighter, these are pretty clunky and heavy. Also not sure why they think that basket thing in the front is useful. Just have a normal basket! We actually can't put anything in there. There's also no water bottle holder which is such a simple thing....the concept is great but these little things make the process so annoying."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,09/01/2017,Bikes are in good shape. The app could be better but is adequate to make service work.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/30/2016,"Unlimited 30 minute rides for 24 hrs is NOT CLEAR. So it is expected of me to inconveniently go off route, search for a kiosk to dock the bike, then un-dock to go back to riding. I would need to time my rides and take out my cell phone to find the nearest kiosk???? Regardless if there are thousands of kiosks, it is still inconvenient for a program that praises itself in being ""convenient."" This may have made perfect sense for a regular New Yorker in ""the know"", but I was a visitor who simply wanted to enjoy a nice ride along the Hudson River. This trip turned out to be a $50 trip for something I thought would only be $12. BULLSHITCiti Bike should waive the overage fee for first time ignorant customers AT LEAST, that's good business. Not just say ""our fine print says... blah blah screw you too."" I will be sure to NOT recommend anyone to Citi Bike, but just take a damn uber."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/04/2017,"What a racket. They charged me an extra 17 bucks so I could do tem a favor and take the bike to an empty location went the place I went to take it back was full and so was the next one. Ended up paying the price of an unlimited metrocard 7 day pass for 2 45 minute bike rides. Not worth it. No text about it being late, nothing. Greedy. Should have know by something run by Citi bank, they make all their money on late fees just like a bank."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/08/2016,"Having lived in Midtown right by a subway for the last few years, I had no real need for a Citi Bike annual pass. But having recently moved apartment to the Lower East Side, a good 10 minute walk to the subway, I thought it would be the ideal time to give it a whirl. After receiving a promotional offer for a $25 discount, I finally took the plunge. What a huge disappointment. Theoretically, it's a great idea. But two weeks after receiving my key I have yet to find an available bike at the THREE docking stations near me even ONCE in the morning. I live on the corner of Ave D and Houston - there is a docking station at Ave C which is always empty except for this one broken bike which always seems to be there. So then I walk a block to Avenue B and similarly, the docking station is always empty in the morning. I've tried at 7:30am, 8am, 9am - no difference. There is NEVER a bike there. A couple of times I have been so determined to use the service I paid for that I even walked over to Rivington St to try the docking station there - same thing, completely empty! So what exactly did I pay for? Oh there are bikes there in the early evening when people cycle back with them on their way home from work. But never when you really need them, in the morning for your daily commute. Three years into the service, Citi Bike have completely and utterly failed to address the problem of poor bike distribution. I remember this being a common complaint when it first started, and remember hearing them promise to address the issue by moving bikes around the stations. They are NOT doing this at my location and it's rendered my $130 pass all but useless. I have never once seen the Citi Bike truck unloading bikes into the Avenue C station. Yesterday I spoke to a guy in my new building who says that he can count on one hand the number of times he's found an available bike in the morning in one year of membership. So what gives? It appears that despite all the complaints, Citi Bike is not competent enough to manage the operation. A competent operation would involve identifying high traffic areas which are always short of bikes - stations which are far away from a subway station for instance - and making sure that bikes are distributed among them evenly throughout the day. But a simple concept like this is evidently too much trouble and/or too complicated for Citi Bike, whose specialty seems to be limited to charging credit cards and ignoring complaints. But it's not just the complete lack of available bikes. There are other things - for instance many of their bikes have rubber handlebars which are so sticky and disgusting you feel like dunking your hand in hydrogen peroxide after touching them. I've managed to get a bike three times now - never in my neighborhood - and each time, the handlebars were disgusting. And then there's the app. I don't enable GPS on my phone and have no desire to use the GPS function of the app. Despite this, every time I open the app I have to dismiss warnings telling me that I don't have GPS turned on. This is just poor design - a well designed app would give the user a preference setting to allow them to disable the GPS locator if they wish. Bike sharing is an excellent idea and I've experienced it working PROPERLY in another country. Like most things in New York though, this just suffers from a general culture of incompetence and bad design. Just like the subway. If you're thinking about shelling out the money for an annual membership, please think twice. If I can make one person decide against paying for this awful service then typing all of this out will have been worth it.EDIT: I added a photo to illustrate the inexcusable situation with bike stations in the East Village. This screenshot was taken just after noon on a Tuesday. As you can see there are no bikes anywhere, it's just empty station after empty station. Absolutely no attempt is being made to distribute bikes to make them available in this neighborhood, and the situation is the same every day. If Citi Bike thinks this is acceptable then I believe the city of New York should take away their right to run this system and give someone else a go. I can't believe I paid $130 to have no bikes available for most of the day."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/05/2016,"Very upset I paid for a year membership. These bikes are simply too heavy for me to use. At 45lbs, unless you are fairly fit/strong to begin with, be ready to spend half your ride walking these heavy bikes any time you have to go up hill. Theoretically, I should be able to get this bike up a hill, in reality because there are so many other people on the roads/paths I cannot keep up my momentum- I have tried every gear- 3 is impossible, 2 just spins without catching, and 1 is a joke. On top of being a nightmare on any slight up hill that has other bikers/pedestrians, the availability is very poor. I usually spend 20 minutes running around trying to find a station both when picking up and returning the bikes. I'm adding one star because my husband loves them, but he is able to take advantage of them on weekdays when the paths are less busy, and he is much physically stronger than I am. I'm so sad to make this review, because I wanted so badly to live citi bike as well!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/18/2017,"I've used citibike for years.. almost as soon as they opened.  To date, I've logged over 650 miles, 400 + miles and dropped 30 thousand calories.  I live in a doorman building, so I don't always have my keys on me.  Recently Citibike accused me of sharing my membership with others.. and deactivated the feature that allows me to log in using my credit card instead of bike token.  I find this extremely annoying as I live a very active lifestyle, have been a massive proponent of Citibike, and do not share my account!  Why would I ever give someone my credit card or bike token?!  That's insane.  I'm beyond annoyed with Citibike.  Thanks for being a crappy partner."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/07/2018,"Living on the Upper East Side and having to rely on taxis or the 6 to get to and from work isn't always ideal. Citi Bike is a nice third option that gets me where I need to be in half the time of the subway and about equal to that if I were in a car (during rush hour). Bikes are usually easy to find and in good condition, plus the light and bell are a nice addition for night travel (although I hate how many time I accidentally ring the bell). All in all, not asking for a lot out of Citi Bike, but I am always happy with the service I receive."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/05/2018,I had a Citibike membership last year and am considering renewal this year. I did not have any significant problems finding or docking bikes. My complaint is that the membership options are limited. Citibike should offer a month-to-month membership option rather than the current monthly payment option that requires a full year commitment. I would be more inclined to join if I could opt in as needed rather than paying $169/year with the limit of 45 minute rides.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/04/2017,I love biking and was very excited to be able to grab a bike and ride through Central Park. I got a day pass for $12 and downloaded the app. This would be a great deal if you didn't have to return your bike every 30 minutes to avoid overage fees. Watching the time as you bike takes away from the experience in a major way. It stressed me out! I went over the time by 1 minutes and 3 seconds for one of my rides and was charged $4 for that. I even contacted customer service to see if they might give me a pass on that minute since it was my first ever ride with them. But they shut me down. I am very disappointed.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,11/03/2017,I had an incredible experience. The parking situation was simple and convenient. The bikes were also good quality bikes. Very comfortable.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/24/2016,"Absolute scam. They are so desperate for cash that they will do anything to collect money off your credit card. We took out two bikes for a 20 block ride, docked and headed into a store. When we came out we couldn't get our code to work and tried multiple stations with no luck. Already pissed I paid $24 and couldn't actually use the bike I hiked home 30 blocks with a dead cell phone. When I called them to ask for a refund they said I also had an additional $90 charge for 'overtime' and refused to refund either charges.  I had apparantly docked improperly but had received no calls, no texts, nothing. The representative said that she could see that I had 'improperly docked', coincidently BOTH bikes. 1. What are the chances we both docked improperly?2. Why do I get texts that tell me when I dock properly but not improperly? 3. I jammed the bike into the docking station and there was no getting it out. I do not even believe it was not locked in, it obviously just did not register.Don't even waste your time, a cab that would have cost  $5 cost me over $100 because Citi bikes are an absolute scam with poor customer service. I'm disputing the charge with my credit card company, I am absolutely not paying it."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/27/2018,Well situated on the east side downtown to midtown. Bikes more decent for city travel than they appear
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/14/2018,"Citi Bikes are a good way to experience the city.  However, having to redock the bike every 30 mins is a joke and just a way to make money.  I paid for two day passes, which should have amounted to around $24-25 total. Instead, I ended up paying $60.00 due to keep the bike out longer than 30 mins per ride. They will try and say they make it clear, but they don't, and it's just another way to make money.  It's just a crappy way to do business but I suppose they're around to make money."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,12/05/2013,I have seen this kind of bike rental in Europe all the time. Seeing in NY city.... bright blue color bikes.... get my attention right away!I try to look at the rental machine.... VERY COMPLICATED & CONFUSING!!! So not user friendly...... It is a great idea to commute in the city by bikes but seeing so many bikes parking there... make me wonder maybe the price or the operation is not so efficient that is why people don't utilize it.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/23/2018,"Great first time experience!! Bike worked, the code to release the bike worked, and the rack to put it back worked. I liked the immediate text message confirming my biking was complete and my summary of miles and calories."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/17/2016,"The bikes are OK and convenience is definitely a bonus but customer service and billing is utterly awful. After several unsuccessful attempts to dock my rented bike I thought I had finally docked it properly only to get a text 3 hours later that I was still being charged. I returned to the docking station, successfully docked my rented bike and found out that no matter what I said or did, I would be charged an extra $38 in overage fees simply because the company doesn't refund anything under $40. With failing docking stations and no ability to contest overage charges I would suggest looking elsewhere for bikes. Their system seems to pry on those who are unfamiliar with the process and catch fails set in place are conveniently set to incur the maximum non-refundable fees. Fail."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/03/2016,"CitiBike has literally changed my life. I am not exaggerating whatsoever.  It has completely transformed how I get around the city.  I've been a member since 2014 and am thrilled to be coming into my third year as a member this fall.Pretty much all of the negative reviews of Citibike here are from tourists complaining about the 30 minute time limit...but these bikes aren't really meant for touring purposes.  Citibike is designed for busy New Yorkers who need to get from point A to point B.  Annual members get 45 minutes, which I've never even come close to hitting.Citibike enables me the convenience and freedom of getting anywhere in the city faster and more reliably than public transit, a rideshare service, or a cab.  A trip that could easily take me 35 minutes on public transit takes 17 minutes on a bike.  In fact, having citibike means I can live further east, enjoy my neighborhood, and pay less of a premium for living in Manhattan due to my distance from public transit.Citibike has made lots of improvements since it first started - newer bike models, introduction of valet service, a great app, continued expansion uptown and into the outer boroughs, and more.For locals, I would highly recommend getting the annual membership.  It's $160 a YEAR.  Compare that to $116 a MONTH for a metrocard.  I definitely city bike 9-10 months out of the year - I typically won't if it's snowing or below freezing.  That means I'm saving easily $1000 a year in transportation costs.And for the most part, it's a very pleasant way to get around.  I take it in the morning to my fitness class, and it's usually very calm and relaxing.  If I have a late night at the office, I thoroughly enjoy my 15 minute bike ride in the calm of the evening.  Sometimes commuting during peak times or along 8th Avenue at rush hour can be stressful, but all in all is definitely worth it."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/06/2016,"It was a great experience to ride around the city but be careful to triple check whether your bike was docked (returned) properly! Why? Because you can be charged $1300 for this...Several tips --1. After you return your bike, make sure you see the green light.2. Make sure you receive a text saying ""You docked bike ####. To ride again, insert the same credit card at any kiosk to get a new 5-digit code.""3. You can also sign up for email notifications or app notifications if you wanna be saferCiti bike informed me about this $1300 charge in the morning. The customer service guy told me to file a police report if I want to avoid this charge... I went on reddit and saw several ppl facing the same situation as me. Suggestions to citi bike --1. It will be great if citi bike can offer some kind of bike insurance. Say we didnt dock the bike properly and some random guy stole the bike...i would rather pay for an insurance in advance2. I did not receive any notifications alerting me that I ""havent return the bike"" or ""your bike didnt show up in our system yet. Maybe you should do something about it"" texts. Maybe citi bike can start sending out this kind of alerts."

So, the CITI BIKE is definitely one that my CC got scammed at.Even the phone calls, yes it could be a sale's call BUT I barely receive sale's calls until giving my # @ CITI Bike payment station.well, the charge was not that big but still..

We asked for a refund of the overages as we were unaware and were basically told to go screw ourselves.  The pittance return was $6.97 on a $230.84 bill...  Seriously!What kind of a racket is this?  I get it's our fault as now we see the rules, but seriously tourist are absolutely taken advantage of by this service.  As a tourist to this city who would think you had to rack and unrack a bike every 30 minutes on a ""day"" pass.  Most tourist would think a day pass meant for the ""day"" as we did.  We toured the Brooklyn Bridge on one day, and City Park on the next and are saddened with our experience and the enduring horrible customer service by Sheila H and the manager William.  Sometimes stepping outside the profit made and being compassionate is the right thing to do.  I will never ever use the service again and I will make sure anybody I know is aware of our treatment.Should have known with a big bank sponsored name they would be big bank nickel and dime charges for the little people loaded with predatory fee practices for unsuspecting tourist.#citibikenyc #citibank #predatory #horriblecsomerservice #visitnyc #newyork #samschwartz #newyorkcity #tourism #billdeblasio #deblasio #cbsnewyork"
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/22/2017,Want to say I just went to London and Amsterdam and they also had their own citi bikes. It was so much better as I wasn't charged a deposit fee of $100 onto my debit card to use them. In London I think it was just about 2 pounds and then if you turned it in late you were charged 2 pounds more. It was great! In Amsterdam it was so cheap to rent a bike. If I ever need to rent one in ny again I will go elsewhere.
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,10/05/2016,I like the idea but bikes are extremely heavy and hard to ride uphill. 1st speed is a joke. You pedal and pedal but the bike barely moves making it pretty hard to keep balance.  3rd speed is hard to pedal yet the bike does not move very fast. Plenty of grannies on their private road bikes fly past me in central park.There is no respect for bike lines from both cars and pedestrians
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/10/2017,the worst citi program ever. a scam and robbed money. A day pass doesn't mean a day pass.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/04/2016,"Very convenient IF you know what you're getting.First of all if you look at all the other reviews, you can see most of them are people who did NOT dock the bike within 30 minutes. (which I'll get into shortly)For $12 you get unlimited 30 minute rides around the city in a 24 hour period. This means you NEED to dock the bike within this timeframe to avoid an overage fee of $4 per every 15 minutes you have the bike. Again, all of this is explained, its just people not reading/understanding what they're purchasing which is sad. The reason behind the 30minute limit and charges is so everyone gets a fair chance of renting a bike, if it was truly unlimited, these things would be impossible to find. Just think about that for a second.If you have an iPhone, you NEED to download the citibike app, trust me it will make finding docks easy and it even tells you the availability before you go.To compare things, there was a guy offering me to rent a bike from the business he worked for and it was $15 for 1 hour. For $3 less ($12) you can get a citibike and use it LONGER and the only requirement is to dock it once every 30 minutes. There are docks in almost every corner of NYC so this isn't an issue at all.With the CitiBike I went all over times square and broadway with friends on a recent trip to NYC. We never had issues and we racked up around 8 miles riding/docking the entire day. I would definitely do this again on my next visit! Just keep in mind that riding a bike through a very busy city like NY can be dangerous and you need to be alert of traffic and signals at all times."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/26/2017,"Citi Bike is numero uno when it comes to convenient, exciting and easy ways to explore the City of New York, the Big Onion as they used to call it.  It's now called the Big Apple by some, but those in the know still refer to it by it's old name, New Amsterdam, and those who know also use Citi Bike.  Now that there's an hourly pass, you don't have to worry about space docking every 30 minutes, just take it nice and slow.  It's the best, and you can't go wrong."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/01/2017,"Purchased a day pass for $12. Later got a charge for $30+ for overage charges because I didn't return the bike every 30 minutes. Booking through the app has the day price of $12 in big bold letters and the extra charges in tiny fine print. So if I rent a bike for the full 12 hours I have to return it 24 times over the course of a day? So ridiculous. Congrats Citibike you got me, I will never use your service again."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/05/2017,Great service. No station when I leave work in midtown which is a pain but I understand the difficulties of logistics
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/24/2017,They have an hourly pass for $6 an hour which is awesome. I love citbike.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/05/2017,"Pretty expensive if you just want the bike for a few errands, and having to check in every half hour is crap. Other than that the system is ok and the idea is great."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,02/24/2018,"I think we need more bikes on everything station, love this bikes, they have become my main way to get to work"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/23/2016,I had a wonderful experience!! Was really helpful to trip around the city!!I highly recommend Citi bike!!!
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/30/2018,Deadly combo of raising rates whilst service is deteriorating..never any bikes or docks available especially at hot spots like GCT..don't really need an algorithm to predict that flow.. Some genius gave Citi bank a sweet heart deal when it was founded and all environment conscious NYers pay for it now..shame on Citi bank AND bike to not rectify that!!I canceled my subscription...
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,02/03/2016,"Please read my review with warning!!!Before I start I want to clarify I am not a stupid person, I went to college I can read instructions! I have just found out I have been charged $100 for 2 hours of biking for two bikes. Apparently you have to check the bike into the station every 30 mins or you get charged with this massive fine! I didnt see this clearly marked anywhere. Please take my example and make sure you avoid citibikes, or check them in every 30 mins!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/15/2017,If there were more working bikes (not Red Lights) I'd give it 5 stars. The only problem is that it's too popular and you frequently can't find a bike when you want.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/24/2017,"CitiBike has done a great thing and added an hourly pass! 6 bucks an hour, no security deposit or overages... A really nice addition to their other options especially for tourists or out of towners looking to explore the city. I used to live in New York so an annual pass made sense, but as a visitor from the West Coast now it's nice to have these other options."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/14/2017,Riding around the city with a Citi bike was a great experience however it sucked having to find a dock every 30 mins.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/24/2017,Rode from 3rd Ave & 53rd St downtown to the Staten Island Ferry Terminal via the East River bike path. It was a nice ride and it was easy to use the Citi Bike station to undock & dock a bike. I plan to use it again.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/24/2017,"Worst bike rental service I've ever used. If you don't want to have any overcharges given to you days after you even used a bike, DO NOT use this service. Customer service is just as useless."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/05/2016,"Works in a pinch--especially in high-traffic areas. If you need to get somewhere in a hurry and it's on the other side of a busy area like midtown there is no faster way than to hop on a Citi bike. The alternatives will take longer (subway) or take longer and cost more (cab).If you're looking to do a little leisurely sightseeing these heavy, lumbering, upright bicycles could work for that, too, you just need to keep the re-docking rules in mind that many have mentioned here."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,06/29/2018,"After renting single use twice, I received an email for $25 off annual membership. Great! but code did not work in app, waited for response by email which didn't arrive (did not wait 72 hours though)so called customer service and after a bit of time on hold got a code that worked. Love saving money! Now for the helpful hints to others-always check bike before unlocking-does the seat stay up, gears change, tires inflated, when returning double check that ride ends after docking- even with green light my first ride continued and went over (so much for above discount). Also since I am in Jersey City and wanted to ride to Hoboken Trader Joe's (why is there no Trader Joe's in JC?) it was next to impossible, only two(2) citibike stations up the elevator impossible to ride to! Coming back was dangerous flying down Patterson plank, no bike lane, potholes, road work-I was following the route on app! I am from California and the electric bikes, scooters, dock less and docked bikes are so much more plentiful and user friendly. Time for some competition here! Just saying, and how can I get a closer Trader Joe's?"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/22/2017,Worst strategy to loot money from the people. Don't fall into the trap. Citi has to think of new ways to earn money
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/08/2017,Bike share. Great idea. FYI: must maintain bikes. Seats broken shifts don't work. Miserable. I can only rent one bike her credit card.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/10/2016,"Citibike is a great way to get around the city. I use it for getting to social events in the evenings and weekends and sometimes for commuting too. It's convenient and a lot more fun than the subway and taxis. Before I joined, I was a little concerned about safety, but actually it's a lot safer than first expected. My friends also mentioned that there used to be a lot of problems years ago particularly around docking. It's easy to see that the experience is much smoother now and has definitely improved. In terms of issues, I've had only a few since I started riding earlier this year. These included bike chains not running smoothly and not being able to always find an open dock. Luckily these were few and far between and easily resolved i.e. using the wrench button on the dock & getting another bike (this works great, btw!) and checking the app before I ride to make sure there's an open space. Also, just a final note - while the bag space may be enough for some, it's a little trickier to fit a handbag and laptop bag for us pack-horse type commuters. A larger sized space would be a welcome addition to the next series of bikes! All in all, a great experience."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/12/2017,"0 for 2 with bikes: first skipped out of gear, second wouldn't shift at all. Customer service was zero help. Not worth your money."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/16/2017,Good location. Many bikes. Doing this review to see if I can get another discount. 25 bucks.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/28/2017,"Excellent for getting around the city. We used CitiBike to see Central Park, The Met and grab lunch at Eatly in the Flatiron district. Just plan your day in 30 minute travel increments."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,05/28/2017,Pretty good system and reliable service. Great for visiting sites in the downtown area. It would be better if the service expands to the other boroughs and Uptown.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/01/2017,"It's surprising how much faster I can get around on the bike. No train delays. No fighting traffic in a car. Plus, I'm getting in shape."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/12/2016,"Awesome alternative to the subway - super easy to use and makes New York seem so much smaller! Docks almost everywhere you look, and the app makes it easier still. Only gripe - the weight of the bikes!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/28/2014,"Lots of fun to ride a bike along the Hudson river bike path. I easily found bikes at the closest location. The kiosk interface was easy to navigate and the credit card reader worked well. I plugged in my rental number to the bike of my choice and zipped away. The trick with renting this bikes is to lift the seat when getting one from the lock mechanism. I rode from battery park to 16 the st in 30 minutes (needed a few photos), exchanged the bike to meet the 30 min limit, and rode back. It was terrific. These bikes, like those in Boston, Chicago and Paris, are wide seat heavy cruisers with 3 speeds. You can't go fast, but this also means its harder to harm yourself/ others. This is especially important since no helmets are available and you're riding in a city!  The price of this rental was a little high but still acceptable. Unlike my experiences elsewhere, there were adequate docking stations everywhere I wanted to dock in NYC, but I think thats only because I rode at 6 am!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/01/2015,"The Citi Bike sucks.  Charged me 40 dollars per bike for 2 hour usage.  Wont ever use it again.At the station, when you got the bikes, you thought you got a bike for up to 24 hours as the screen displayed"" 24-hour pass"". HOWEVER, It did not made clear at the station at all that you had to return the bike within 30 mins. WOW, VERY IMPRESSIVE on the TRICKS to cheat the new users. Any place within a 30 mins bike distance, why should I pay more than $10 to ride there and also have to look for a station to return it,  rather than just request a Uber? Greedy Banks... So sad"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,11/26/2015,"Personally using citibike is a pretty neat way to explore NYC there are many docking stations around the city. The bikes have a place to put your backpack/bag they have tire guards, lights, a bell, and the bikes are all three speed. Key is remembering to dock the bike (if you rent it for 24 hours) every 30 minutes. I'd give a rating of 5 stars however, sometimes when I docked the bike and went to get the code the machine would run out of paper (remember the codes to pull the bike back out) or get stuck in my situation of thinking ""what on earth?! How do I pull the bike out again I don't remember the code, and there is no paper with the code"".With all that being said there are bike lanes so it not too crazy biking around in traffic but with the amount of tourists walking everywhere especially on the bike path I'd make sure you get the bike that does not have a broken bell or you'll find yourself constantly shouting ""bike"" or ""left""."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/28/2017,First time renting a bike with citi bike at Central Park. Ended up on other side of park and there were no docking stations so I went over the 30 minute rental rule.  Ended up getting charged $39.20 twice! Called customer service and explained what happened being a first time renter and not being able to find a docking station! Was told I would be credited back one of the $39.20 charges and to check in 2 days. I was never given the refund I was told I would get and am very dissatisfied with their customer service. I will never rent a bike from them again.
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/09/2015,"30 minutes per ride!?!This is an obnoxiously small amount of time. An hour would be reasonable but, you cant go any distance that is worth renting a bike for $10 in 30 minutes.However, what do I expect when you put blood sucking Citibank in charge of what could have been a fantastic resource for NY'ers and Tourists.And a minimum $4 punishment for overages...Another great idea ruined by greed."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/20/2017,A helpful and convenient transportation option to get around the city with. Let's me so my errands with a lot more speed and efficiency.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/16/2014,"For around $100, you get a ""magical"" blue fob (annual subscription) that gives you access to any bike in NYC and the 5 boroughs for 45 minutes.  Think you'll run out time and don't want to pay an overage fee?  Return the bike to any kiosk, wait 2 minutes and unlock another... You're good for another 45 minutes, and so on, and so on...If you live or work in NYC and don't subscribe to CitiBike on an annual basis, shame on you -- you've made a mistake.  I had my CitiBike epiphany last year and made over 100 one-way trips over the year, avoiding the $2.50 subway fare and saving over $150 over the course of the year (while logging nearly 700 miles of heart healthy cycling exercise).CitiBike offers a great, healthy option for mixing up your NYC commute.  It also offers a second option when you don't want to deal with an overcrowded rush hour subway.NYC was voted the most bike-friendly city by Bicycling magazine in 2014.  With over hundreds of miles of dedicated bike lanes and the popular West Side Greenway, find out what you've been missing and get yourself in shape!  I promise you'll see NYC in ways you haven't before and you'll encounter many memorable photo opportunities.Minus one star as a kiosk problem will be encountered from time to time, but generally the system works as expected."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/23/2014,"I purchased an annual membership recently. It was $95 but with $8 tax and $15 discount for paying with a Citi credit card, it came out to $88. (Note that tax is assessed even if you do not live in New York.) I've mainly been using it to get from the World Trade Center and Christopher St PATH stations to Chinatown, since crosstown public transit sucks in that area. (If not NYC in general - seriously, when's the last time you rode the L?)The biggest positive is simply the existence of the service. Being able to take out a bike anywhere in Mid/Lower Manhattan or Downtown Brooklyn and drop it off elsewhere is very convenient. It's also cheap, at less than $8 a month.As for negatives, the main one is that it is difficult to pull out or push in a bike. When renting a bike, it doesn't always work the first time; it probably takes an average of 1.5 tries to get it right. Returning the bike is even harder; I'd estimate it takes an average of 2 tries (the record for me was 5 so far). Also, a successful return is supposed to be indicated by a green light, but sometimes it doesn't show up and you only know if the bike has been locked in place (but not if the system recognizes that). Then, if you really want to make sure it's been returned successfully, you have to log on to the website or call them to verify."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/23/2016,"Overall the best per dollar thing I pay for each year. The annual membership is so worth it, you get unlimited riding for a while year! Not to mention the 45min limit can even be extended if you dock for 2mins, you can even take the same bike out again, no extra charge!I use city bikes probably 8 times a week to commute from Brooklyn to midtown Manhattan. I hate bike maintenance, which is a big reason I love citi bikes. Yes the bikes all aren't perfect but cone on the are outside all year around. You don't like a bike then lock it up and grab another one. Run over a pot hole? No big deal. Something wrong with the bike? I am not going to have to fix it or have to pay for it.For me it's the perfect way to not only commute but also get between subway stops, zip around midtown traffic or even scenic weekend rides chaining together 45min rides. Do yourself a favor and give it a chance, don't get frustrated when a bike squeaks, is a bit heavy (better workout) or the seat won't stay (just need to twist the round thing on the seat adjuster tighter)."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/30/2015,"Never any bikes available near me--and they just removed the station outside my apartment! Why exactly did I pay for this garbage? Theres no reason i should have to walk halfway to my destination just for an available bike. On top of that there is no identifiable system for ensuring available docks, so i sometimes end up riding around for 15 minutes AFTER reaching my destination, so i, show up to my meetings sweaty AND late. Avoid!  Just get yourself a used bike, way cheaper in the end anyway. If this review stops just one person from renting citibike then I'll be happy.But hey, I'm the sucker who shelled out the simoleans"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,09/29/2015,"Citibike Bike needs to do a MUCH better job at rebalancing empty and full stations. Almost always no docking stations available near work in the morning (Flatiron) and almost no bikes available there in the evening.  I'd think there are a lot of people willing to do this work at low wages so Citi Bike's failure to do this better shows a high level of disregard to customers who pay an annual fee in order to have a bike when they need it. To whoever is responsible for rebalancing and allocating resources for that: DO YOUR JOB BETTER.It reminds me of the brainiacs who determined that it is a good idea for all taxis in the city to change over schedules at the same time instead of staggering schedules.  Otherwise, the program is great- best way to get around the city when it works."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/05/2015,"Worst service ever!  I've been charged over300 dollars for 12 hours of service.  The system failed at the docking spot, regardless of the green light and the customer service people knowing that there was an extra bike in the docks.  They left me high and dry with the use of 12 hours on a 24 hour contract.  I am from colorado, so instead refunding the money they took an extra 171 in addition to the deposit of 101.Which why do they a deposit of they have ur credit card?  Anyways after spending a great deal of time and effort...they will not refund any money for half only 12 hours of service because their system failed to see the nber on the bike dock!Bad customer service Jermaine and Tina!!!!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/18/2014,"I saw an earlier review that declared Citibike life changing.... I would have to agree.I purchased the annual pass with my Citi debit card and received a 15% rebate back.I figured I could make up the cost if I take 8 less cab rides this year.I passed that pretty quickly.1.It saves a ton of money and time. I can get from the Port Authority to work (55 and Mad) faster than the subway, and only a few minutes more than a cab. I can make it down to NYU from midtown faster than the subway, and for $20 less than a cab. The savings REALLY add up.2. You can really add in a lot more activity. The 30 minutes a day I spend on the bike getting to and fro are just another 30 minutes of heart healthy activity.3.It is enjoyable. The other morning I was very early, so went for a quick lower loop in Central Park. It is relaxing, and also a great way to connect with the city in a different manner.Only downside is it seems like everyone is moving in the same direction, so sometimes stations are empty or full, but there are so many that it really doesn't matter."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,06/04/2016,"Weiss Citi Bike as a tourist, and it was okay. There aren't enough docking stations put in places they would be used. Go above 87th street in Central Park so I can bike throughout the park. I also noticed that kiosks are a couple of blocks from any attraction save Times Square. I also had trouble putting my bike up and renting another bike. It would say there was an error, bikes wouldn't release with the codes, or once the entire terminal decided not to release a single one of the eight bikes there. When we called for help, it didn't really help. After saying crazy basic stuff like, ""Did you put your code in?"" She said all the bikes must be broken. It would be nice if the app had told me that.Overall, a fun way to see New York but it has some flaws. I'd look at more stations near attractions. Also, as an outsider, I found it.....um, let's go with 'interesting' that areas I know are wealthier had bike rental abilities, while others...didn't. Include everyone, yo."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/17/2016,"Docking stations are starting to fail, no initiatives from the company, a lack of competence and support from the customer service department.Citibike is becoming the victim of their own success. As a user since 2013, I am utterly and absolutely disappointed and angry with Citibike. As the company grows, there are more users leading to disproportionate distributions of the bike availability as well as the wear and tear of the bikes. however, the customer service has not grown with it. I had an incident that I couldn't dock my bike even after going through three different stations and trying every single available dock. Citibike actually asked me to take the bike home with me. It took 4 phone calls from my end for someone to take the bike after 2 days and they even had the audacity to charge me for those time. I also had to tell my story every single time I called. When I asked to speak to a manager, they refused to come to the phone. I am so profoundly disappointed. Mr. Jay Walder, something needs to be done with your company, otherwise, you will keep losing money left and right. Isn't that why you came to be the CEO in the first place?"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,10/23/2017,Citibike is great. But there are not enough docking stations uptown- and probably in other neighborhoods as well. Why not economize by building stations in less- popular areas (like uptown) with less slots? This would seem to be a win win compromise.
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,04/16/2017,"Great bikes , great idea. Just sometimes bike stack at docking station. Also 30 min max ... What is this ??? 2017 USA. No freedom ? People pay so charge 20-30$ and let people to use ..."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/05/2015,"Firstly, let me alert tourists and oversea's visitors that the program is basically an old fashioned bait and switch to lure low-knowledge visitors to using a program for $10 and subsequently put hidden charges on their credit card. Its disgusting that NYC would stoop to this level of activity. I will explain more later but for now: Caveat Emptor. You can take a gamble to try and avoid ""hidden charges"" and I will explain in this review how, but its more headache than its worth. IMO you are much better off renting a bike from one of the local shops than using this ridiculous boondoggle.Now the review!Summary: Terrible, sadly all roads in NYC lead to disaster!Conceptually very similar to the excellent programs that are run in London/D.C (I've used both) but with one big UNIQUE catch that makes this a disaster for tourists - MAX 30 MINS RIDE. Yes, read that again and remember - you have 30 minutes from check-out to check-in.How it works: using a credit card you check-out a bike that you ride around and then check-back in within 30 mins. Like a library book! Bike stations are present all over the place, even Brooklyn. That's the theory, but here's the reality.1. There's hidden fee's which can be up to 5x the $10 rental fee.2. The hidden fee's are incurred when you can't check the bike in on time.3. Maintenance problems and lack of stations result in 2 all day long.Theoretically, what you're getting is a $10 hop-on hop-off bike.Reality is that you're taking a huge gamble with your credit card using this.Of-course everything was great when the program was new and flush with cash, but now that's running out the equipment is degrading fast, very fast! Most of the time you can pick up a bike, but its a gamble whether you'll be able to get it checked back in within the ridiculous 30 minute timeline. Miss that? More charges. Take longer than 15 minutes to check-in? More charges ... it can easily add up to over $100 in overage charges on a single day. They're raking in millions in overage fee's on credit cards and will continue to do so until the regulators step in. Classic NYC, use exorbitant charges on tourists to fund the politicians and fat cat union salaries. Remember the bad old days of Internet subscription web-sites, once you give your credit card details, its up to them what they bill you - this is very similar. Now that the Euro is cratering I'm not sure how long this crazy scheme is going to last and the bike scheme collapses.On my recent trip I went to check my bike back in and at best had to make 5 or 6 attempts before one of the stations accepted it. That's IF I found an empty station - the racks in mid-town are absolutely packed. This is a good theory but due to lack of maintenance its simply not reliable, much better to UBER or use the sub.Now, how to avoid the hidden charges? Simple - surf bike racks. This way you only ride the bike for 15 minutes, check it in (may take multiple attempts in the 15 minutes) and then check it out 2 mins later. Simple! No overage charges. Yes, this means a lot of check-in/check-out, but this is the ONLY way you can reduce (you never completely eliminate) the risk of being hit with massive charges.This boondoggle was created at the peak of the easy credit bubble and its deteriorating fast. Already theres reports that this is a real money sink and NYC has losing money hand over fist. Either thats going to result in more maintenance cut-backs, outrageous fee's or eventually the program will be phased out. I think its the last one."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/03/2014,"I am giving 3 starts cause after all the bad experience trying to get the codes to unlock the bikes we did have a fun going bar hopping in these bikes. This is what u gotta do, get one by one, don't try getting 2 codes at once cause that will not work, if the first code you get doesn't work then go back to the machine after 2 mins and press get a new code and swipe your card (YOU WONT GET CHARGED AGAIN) they only needed to make sure you got a code before, that's all, once you get the new code then that should work. CITI BIKE please fix your damn system as it's really an inconvenience for everyone to rent your bikes, BARCLAYS bikes in London don't have this issue at all, come on! Get this fixed ASAP"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/27/2013,"I figure I'd give it a try since it was a nice day and I was running late for a doctors appointment.  I purchased a 24hr pass for $10 and went to unlock my bike with a 5 digit code. I looked for a receipt or perhaps something that printed out my code since I'm dyslexic, but nada.  I think the printer ran out of paper and this seemed to happen more than once at the stations I went to.  The seat easily adjusted all the way down since I'm vertically challenged.  I was surprised the basket fit my giant handbag.  Then I was on my way!  My challenge was to survive without being run over by crazy taxi's* or squished by a giant bus.  I made it 10 blocks in less than 10 mins. Perfect!  Right on time for my appointment.  I would've been late waiting for the bus and I would've paid about $8 to go 10 blocks in a Taxi.  So I returned the same way I came, except I got stuck in the bus lane and couldn't cross 3 lanes on 3rd.  I was getting honked at.  I hope the cops aren't going to start ticketing the Citibikers.  It'll take me some time to get used to riding in the city and I think I'll get a helmet and leave it at work.  For now I'll just stick with the daily/weekly pass because over the last few nights after work, I can't find a bike anywhere near Grand Central.  After 5:30 it's like rush hour for Citibikes.  I see them everywhere, as many yellow cabs there are Citibikes.The iPhone app is helpful in finding the nearby stations and the availability of bikes.  It's about 99.99% accurate.  I walked to a few stations and there were no bikes, just the broken ones that don't undock.A few tips for you new riders:-Use your iPhone notes to take down the 5 digit code if the station doesn't print out your code/receipt!-If you get the daily/weekly pass, each time you go to a new station for a bike you have to swipe your card again to get another code.-Check the bike before you undock it!  I found one w/o a pedal.-Don't ride in the bus lane unless you really have to.-If there's a red light on the bike, the bike is broken.-When docking your bike, push it in and hold it there for about 40 secs.  Then make sure it's locked in before you leave!*remember that video game?  I used to love running everybody over in my yellow crazy taxi!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/04/2013,"From the perspective of a tourist in NYC for the long weekend Citibike is outstanding. Firstly I must admit that I am slightly biased as I am from Montreal, where this bike sharing system was developed, so I was proud to see our system being used in New York. We spent the entire weekend in NYC without ever having to take the subway thanks to Citibike, Amazing! We used it to go everywhere and only once did we arrive at a station to find that there were not two docks available for us (I'm sure on a work day the situation may be more difficult). On this occasion one of us had to ride an extra 2 blocks to dock the bike, no big deal. I was also very impressed with the development of bike lanes in Manhattan and have to say that I felt safe riding throughout the city. If you stick to the streets with designated bike lanes you seem to always be only a couple of blocks away from a station. Hopefully the city will continue to expand the system (which is only available south of 60th street and in certain areas of the other boroughs) and continue to make the city more bike friendly."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,07/11/2016,"Very disappointed lately by Citibike this Spring / Summer. I bought a year pass when they expanded to the UWS and am 11 months into it.  I just unchecked the auto renew option on their website. Within 1/2 a block of my apartment there is a 63 bike dock one way and a 21 bike dock the other way.  That's 84 spots for bikes.  Expanding that radius I soon get another 51, 27, and 55 dock in comfortable walking distance, another 133 more docks.  Beyond that I have walked past numerous subway stations.In Fall 2015 and Winter 2015 no problems getting bikes, now it seems that everyone on the UWS woke up to this being a thing and there are zero bikes from a potential population of 217 docks available by 7.45 AM.  They really need to refill stations and do something now. I work in midtown and similarly the bike availability is scant throughout the day, this last few weeks the days I get bikes it is either 100f and humid, or raining.Additionally the app has got really slow to update the bike availability, just this morning I walked to a dock the app was saying had 25 bikes, half way there it updated to zero.  I don't believe that 25 users just pulled bikes from the rack.  I'm going to try the Univelo NYC app instead of the citibike one to see if that does a better job staying up to date with bike availability.I have not experience the dock not working problem (actually I have, once).  Mostly this is user error, make sure you lift the rear of the bike by the saddle when the light goes green, make sure the bike is upright and straight into the dock.  Now bike maintenance, they seem to have fixed the teething troubles with the gen 2 bikes and have them back in service but still there are not enough bikes around.  Also when you flag a bike as needing maintenance it sits in the dock for days, taking that dock out of service and the bike!  A double whammy to usability in the system, flagging a bike as not working is against your own self interests as it cloggs up the system where you travel!It's become a service I pay for that I cannot rely on being available when I need it.For day / 3 day / week renters, read the words directly to the left of the credit card slot.  RIDES OVER 30 MINUTES INCUR EXTRA FEES.  They really make it pretty clear."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,11/20/2016,"Love the fact that they're are plenty of bike stations and the Citibike App tells you how many bikes are available at a station, so you can plan your trip ahead of time."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,04/24/2015,"I work and live downtown, so the IDEA of Citibike is great. I can skip the subway on a nice night and commute, run errands, etc.Ideally.What actually happens? Last night, for example, I spent 30 minutes trying EVERY SINGLE docking station at 2 different spots (9th ave. and 18th; 9th ave. and 21) and NONE were accepting bikes. There were at least 20 spots between the two. Getting bikes out is the same story, most of the time.I then had to go, out of my way and cutting into my schedule, to 20th and 8th which, thankfully, had one dock accepting bikes. I have seen bikes carelessly leaned up against racks that I can only assume frustrated riders have ditched after fruitless efforts to dock at broken stations. For the amount of use and advertised availability this is absolutely unacceptable! When I now have to inconvenience myself and break my ass circling the neighborhood to find a WORKING dock before my time is up and I start getting charged, I have a MAJOR problem with that.  FIX YOUR DOCKING SYSTEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/22/2016,"We rented four city bikes on our recent vacation to NYC. We wanted to ride through Central Park. The bicycle attendant was very helpful with helping us rent our bikes and giving us instructions about docking the bikes. What he forgot to mention however was that you have to dock the bikes every 30 minutes or you will be charged a crazy amount of money. It does say this on the website, but at the actual location it does not.  Had we been aware we would have docked the bikes accordingly instead of being charged $122 dollars for a hour and a half bike ride. When we called customer service they were rude about it . Apparently you can't speak to a manager, only submit claims. They review the claims and respond to agents who relay the message. The whole thing is very sketchy and unorganized."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/14/2013,"First blush review.  I will be updating because I feel privileged to be contributing to saving the planet, however, my first ride wasn't exactly perfect.The seat couldn't be adjusted, and the first 2 drop off points were full, even though their app said their were available slots.Not good.  Overall, a good experience that I'm hoping will only get better, but they're going to need to really work at maintaining and improving this."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/29/2016,"Set Up to Take Advantage of Unsuspecting Customers.  If you think this is a fun a wonderful way to see the sites in NYC, think again.  It's set up so that you have to dock and re-dock the bike every 30 minutes.  You think you're paying for an all day pass for $12 but really they will charge you exorbitant fees for any time over the 30 minutes that you don't dock the bike.  I just received my bank statement and had overage charges because I docked the bike within 32 minutes instead of 30.  You have to locate a citi bike docking station enroute to wherever you're going and that was not fun.  All in, the charges for the time that I went over 30 minutes were more than the day pass.I have to say that we really enjoyed riding the bikes around the city but this system of docking every 30 minutes and charging exorbitant fees would prevent me from ever doing it again."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/29/2016,"I'm not going to complain about the overage fees that many Yelpers are complaining about because I know how to read the rules/directions (and I have a yearly pass which I guess makes me more experienced than most). And in general I think Citibike is an amazing addition to NYC that is generally useful and a great way to connect places that our subway doesn't connect.But lately, in addition to my previous review:(1) They've been sooooooo lazy about refilling the stations. I could somewhat understand if they just filled the stations at night and then the stations happened to be empty by the time I go to work in the morning because other commuters take them first. But nope -- I check on the app every night before bed -- and I'm lucky if they even refill 2 out of the nearest 7 stations to me. The rest they just leave empty. Which means that I can't use a bike to commute to work and I can't use a service that I'm paying for. If they want Citibike to work they need to understand the patterns of how and when people commute and then not only refill the stations at night but also in the morning mid-way through the rush hours -- otherwise the system isn't going to work!(2) The brakes on 90% of the older bikes (which make up from my estimation about 80% of the total fleet now that they've been taking the new bikes out of service for repair) are totally worthless. You have to squeeze really really hard for any effect and even then it's minimal braking. I've nearly hit pedestrians and nearly been hit by cars because of these useless brakes. And no I am not a particularly fast or reckless rider - I follow the rules of the road. (3) They also don't really clean the bikes. The handlebars of most of them are disgustingly sticky(4) Customer service is pretty useless. They email back quickly saying ""oh, I'll forward your comments to our team"" and then nothing ever changes."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,04/07/2015,"After almost 2 years remains a system with great POTENTIAL.  Seems they've outsourced customer service.   Last night I attempted to return a bike to 24th street and Lex. Months ago the busy station 2 blocks north had been removed (Citi Bike told me it was do to construction - but there's been none whatsoever). Now the Lex 24 station (next to Baruch College)  is out of service.  I called customer service to find out the status and the rep said (incredibly): ""we don't have information on that - let me put you on hold and check social media"". Say what??!!  SOCIAL MEDIA??!!   But I called CITI BIKE!!! How can they not have info on their OWN stations?  UNACCEPTABLE.They maintain  a Facebook page - but if you post a comment you can't even find it. I think they remove negative comments and questions. So overall, as a ""member"" it's hugely frustrating to feel such a ""disconnect"" with customer service. System updates seem to be sporadically issued at their whim. Finally, there are some no-brainer fixes (many are SAFETY related)  which I hope so see one day SOON:1)  BROKEN STATIONS. You can push a button to report a broken bike - so there should be a similar  button you can press when a  docking station is broken and won't accept bikes (any member will tell you there a few broken docking stations per location).  Right now CB wants you to take the time and CALL them to report broken docking stations. Please!! And why do these stations break so often? SUE THE MANUFACTURER!!   Don't raise our rates.2) BROKEN GEARS. About one third to one half of all bikes have useless, slipping third gears. This is both incredibly inconvenient (unless you want a spin class kind of work out and have LOTS of time to get where you're going) and DANGEROUS.   They should address this IMMEDIATELY with the manufacturer. SAFETY ISSUE. Why does this happen so much? SUE THE MANUFACTURER!!   Don't raise our rates.3)  CRAPPY BELLS. The bells are not loud enough (a mere chime), fail frequently and are inconvenient to use. They should be completely replaced with something actually USEFUL. This is IMPORTANT in a busy city such as NYC.  SAFETY ISSUE. Why do the bells hardly work? SUE THE MANUFACTURER!!   Don't raise our rates.4) KICK STANDS.  Seems more and more bikes don't have kick stands anymore. WHY??!!!!  INCREDIBLY INCONVENIENT and, again DANGEROUS.  Easy drop a bike into a car lane while your getting set to ride or dismounting. 5) WHIMPY LIGHTS.  Especially the critical, rear lights -  a mere flicker of red. When you see lights other bikers use, you KNOW there are significantly brighter lights being manufactured. The LED technology exists - so PLEASE put it to use!!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/05/2016,"My boyfriend and I had a blast using citibike for the first time, we grabbed a bite to eat, rode through a few parks and explored Brooklyn. We found citibike docks with ease every time we wanted to make a stop. I would recommend citibike to anyone."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/12/2017,"I purchased a day pass for a citibike last Saturday and rode it for 20 mins then locked it to a dock to go to the bar nearby. After 2 hours, I came out and try to use the bike again. Apparently, according to Citibike, I did not properly lock my bike and it was gone! I called the customer service, they claimed that I would be fully responsible and I would be charged for $1200 if the bike is missing! They also said there was nothing they could do and suggest that I should go to the police station and file a report of the missing bike immediately (it was 1 am). So I went to the police station and the police said that there's nothing they can do for me since it is not my property. They are angry that Citibike continues to send people to police station knowing that there's nothing they can do about it!. Cikibike acted careless about the whole situation and direct their customers to the wrong places. I will NEVER use Citibikes again!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/07/2015,"Citi bike is my favourite mode of transport. They are safe, cheap and convenient. Downtown they are everywhere. A further expansion into Brooklyn, above 59th in Manhattan and starting in Queens would be amazing.Everyone needs this!"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/16/2013,"Well, a little over a month after the launch and sadly I'm going to have to downgrade Citi Bike to 2 and a half stars for now.Let's start with the good: whatever problems there were with docking bikes seem to have been resolved. So have the long waits on the customer service line; calls are answered in less than a minute now. And on weekends, Citi Bike has been great; I can almost always find a bike and it's a great way to get around.  I'd give it a B+.But weekdays are an F.  I signed up for Citi Bike mostly so I could commute to and from my job in east Midtown, which I did every day for the first three weeks.  Since then, there are never any places to dock a bike in the morning and there are never any bikes available after 5. I wouldn't mind walking a few blocks to another station, but there are literally NO bikes available ANYWHERE within a ten block radius of my office.  Citi Bike is supposed to rebalance stations by transporting bikes to where they are needed, but as far as I can tell this is never done. I'm not getting the service I paid for and it sucks.The Citi Bike app needs a tweak, too.  I find it's generally accurate, but when a bicycle is out of service and can't be checked out (red light), there is no point in listing it as available on the app. I would hate to walk 4 blocks to a station with 6 ""available"" bikes when none of them are actually available to rent.I'm still a big supporter of the program--I know it can't be easy starting a bike share in a place like New York and the response has been overwhelming (over 50,000 annual members!), but it's pretty clear NYC Bike Share was not up to the challenge and won't be for quite some time."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,01/29/2017,Citi bike is the best!  Thank you NYC & Citibank. Saves my family time and money and gives us extra exercise!
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,12/14/2016,Used a day pass to try it out. Biked from Columbus Circle to 46th street and 3rd. I found the system worked really well. Plenty of bikes and empty slots at all locations. My gripe is the brakes were dangerously weak. Had to stop by putting my legs down.  I hope someone is checking on this!
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/07/2017,"I got a Citibike on Sunday. Since this was my first time ever using one, I called a customer care from bike stand. I mentioned to her that I have never used this service before and was in a rush. I asked her about the plans they offer and if I can take the bike on hourly basis. She mentioned that they only have 1 day, 3 days, monthly and annual plans. Since I needed the bike only for few hours, I went with a daily pass. The customer care representative asked me to spot a kiosk nearby to complete the transaction. What she ignored telling me is that the bike needs to be docked every 30 minutes to a bike stand to avoid a late fee. On returning the bike, I saw a humongous charge on my credit card of 100+. On calling customer care multiple times, every time I was told curtly that 'you need to plan your trip accordingly, '12$ is for system use', 'there is nothing we can do' etc. They adjusted the charge nominally on requesting a first-time courtesy but did not do it completely.This bike service is a complete scam and rip off. The customer agents are rude and this company is in business of making money based on customer's ignorance. With the amount of money they charged me, I could have bought an actual bike and used it forever!  I want to question the rationale for this policy. If this is for bike sharing, the customers should be charged overtime only when the bikes there are less bikes available at the stand (similar to demand based pricing of Uber). The whole bike stand where I took the bike from was full! It pains to know that a large bank like Citi is sponsoring such an unethical company bike company! It seems both are not able to earn money by fair and regular business and adopting to such practices. Are consumer agencies listening to customer's plights and can this unfair policy be changed?Why am I being subject to something I was not aware of? Something that the customer care did not care to explain to me completely? I could have opted not to ride the bike that day. How does the charge of $ 100+ plus taxes justify using the bike for few hours in addition to paying a daily rate of $12 plus taxes and being liable for 1200$ for a lost or stolen bike? The company needs to train the customer service agents to give complete information and change the unfair overtime fees policy.I am simply not prepared and 'cannot afford' to pay 112$ as a bike rental for a day. I am sure others like you value your hard-earned money as well."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/17/2016,"Really fun!  The only reason I didn't 5 stars is the map at the terminal did not give all the stations so I took a cab when I could have biked. The texts really help. I'm going to join for a year. I hope more people use this so we can get more bike lanes!And here's a tip.... There is a bungee cord for tying a package to the front ""basket"" near the handles. Kept my dinner take-out safe on the ride home!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/25/2016,"Great service. Fun to bike around the city - feels like you can see and experience more than other modes of transportation. However it was annoying when there were not enough free docks so you are having to bike a around trying to find a free dock to return your bike and end up far from your destination. And lots of bikes were broken - flat tire, gears that do not stay in gear... Somewhat dangerous because the gear thing you don't know is a problem until you start riding already. Thank goodness we didn't run into any brake problems."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/01/2013,"Pros:-It's not the lightest bike but it gets me from east side to west side much quicker than the crosstown buses!-It costs less than my monthly unlimited metrocard for the ENTIRE year-It's easy to navigate once you get a hand of it, sturdy and stable, I was able to bike w my flipflops :)-They're all over the city!Cons:-you might not find a bike from time to time-there's NO app for my window phone-you gotta pedal hard and fast if you're going to longer distance that'll take longer than 45mins-there's not too many docking stations in inner brooklyn or queensAll in all, I still like it better than weekend MTA!"
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,02/09/2015,"CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS. I was charged over 100 bucks by Citibike because the dock malfunctioned one night and my bike didn't lock (even though I saw the green light). As a result Citibike recorded that I took a 7 HOUR trip between 11pm and 6am. Huh?! I called for a refund but they have a strict 90-day refund policy and I missed the deadline. I told them that a 7 hour trip in the middle of the night clearly wasn't consistent with my riding history (almost 400 trips so far) but they're mad stubborn and they refused. So be warned. Check your credit card statements and do it often, because these bikes DO malfunction after enough trips and you will get charged (my roommate also got charged $60 for a ride he never took). Since Citibike's docking technology clearly isn't ready for prime time, and their organization is inflexible when it comes to refunds, I won't be renewing my annual membership for at least a couple years until I can be sure I won't get slapped with extra fees."

NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,07/06/2016,"The rates on this are stupid for the day pass which is what I was trying out for the first time. You can only ride the same bike 30 minutes before you have to turn it? That's so stupid considering I (and many others I assume) were using it to get to and from work. At least give like a 40 minutes per ride before charging a another $4 on the $13 daily pass. Especially for a user who has to be even more careful biking in the city for the first time ever, give us a break. Whoever calculated the 30 minute rule should be fired."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/06/2016,"Please test the brakes before you ride. I used a bike that didn't have functional brakes. To say these bikes can be poorly maintained is an understatement. I've always had minor issues when I used this service: bike without kickstand, wheel wasn't perfectly aligned with the handle bars, bent wheel, squeaking brakes. After the time when I couldn't stop at a red light. I refuse to use them ever again. I got my refund when I complained so their customer service wasn't as inept as people claim. The idea is great, it's just the execution has major flaws.Just be careful."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,12/27/2014,"This was my third time using citi bike as a tourist in New York. The sheer fact that it works at all and that you can hop on a bike and zoom for miles through this magical city makes up for a lot of its imperfections. So that's the main ""pro""--it exists. Unfortunately the cons can be exasperating and with each visit I find a new glitch. Here's the list of systemic failures that I've encountered, listed here not to dissuade you from using the bikes but to save you some frustration. 1. All bike docks end at the southern border of Central Park, so you can forget about biking the charming upper west side, the park itself, or biking to the best art museums in the city, like the Met or the Frick.  2. Many stations don't work. Sometimes the kiosks have a little out of order sign, but sometimes they don't, which leads to a lot of wasted time discovering for yourself that the the dock is on the fritz. 3. NEW GLITCH JUST DISCOVERED THIS TRIP: Once you use your credit card to rent a bike, you are locked out of using that credit card again anywhere in the system until that pass expires. Confused? Here's how this little slice of misery works. Yesterday I used my credit card to rent a 24 hour pass at noon while my wife and two kids were shopping in SOHO. For the next 3 hours I blissfully explored all of lower manhattan. Then my wife wanted to join me. We met at a dock and I tried to buy another 24 hour pass for here, but I got an error message when I dipped my credit card. ""You are not authorized to use another bike...."" or something similar. I called the citibike number and was told that I had to use a different credit card to make another purchase. Problem was that we only had the one credit card between us. A ten minute conversation ensued during which I suggested a few solutions but it was the land of no's. They would NOT refund my 3 hour old purchase so that my card would be reset and I could purchase 2 passes. They would NOT just wipe my card out of their system without a refund (I was perfectly willing to eat the original $10 and pay an extra $20 for two passes). They could NOT take a different credit card number over the phone, I had to have the plastic at the machine. Bottom line: we were unable to ride together (I know, poor us, we had to walk to the Brooklyn bridge, a first world problem), and citibike refused to allow us to pay them an extra $20. No wonder the system filed for bankruptcy--but was recently saved by a new investor. I hope they devote a night to reading yelp reviews as they reboot the system...."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,12/06/2014,"Relying on Citi Bike for transportation is like an exercise in the frivolities of human romance: you absolutely love and adore it when it works, and you absolutely detest it when it doesn't. My friend and I visited Manhattan over a few days while the weather happened to be extraordinarily sunny and warm. ""Why not purchase the 24-hr day pass for $10 instead of taking the subway?"" we thought. Initially, riding the bikes was an absolutely joy. We zipped around Manhattan to the places we needed to go, felt the wind rustle through our hair, and even beat the estimated transit time by subway. Our second trip with the day pass was when the problems began. We couldn't find bikes at a the first station we passed. We biked to another station, which had bikes that wouldn't unlock. Then we biked to yet another station, where the bikes STILL wouldn't budge. Finally, by the fifth or so station, we were able to unlock two bikes. Unfortunately, this series of events happened multiple times throughout the day. On the fourth time, exasperated, we finally gave up.Citi Bike is a great experiment that proves that people will embrace the concept of bike sharing. The execution of this bike sharing program, on the other hand, needs a lot of work. I would not recommend Citi Bike share because despite it being fantastic when it works correctly, if you depend on it for more than a few trips, it will undoubtedly fail you."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/29/2016,"Revised review -- DO NOT purchase a 24 hour pass! Despite the fact that it states you will be charged only $13 for a 24 hour unlimited use ride package, they actually withhold $101 dollars from your cc account every time you buy a pass. A bit alarmed when I saw this charge on my statement, I called citibike customer service to let them know I didn't remember agreeing to this large fee, they informed me that indeed, it is in the very fine print when you agree to their user statement when renting, thus they would do nothing for me and instead told me that it was up to my bank or cc company to refund the balance of $88 back to my account which as you know, could take up to several days. When I asked why the hold was so large in comparison to the advertised cost of a day pass, she had no answer and didn't seem to mind at all either when I told her I thought this policy was very sneaky and as such would not be using the citibike service anymore. SO glad I did not fall for the discounted yearly membership pass offer that they extended to me after writing my first review - as who knows what hidden charges are incurred with that. Unfortunately I guess sometimes if it just seems like something is too good to be true, it's actually just too good to be true."

Big mistake, I used a bike for about 7 hours and was charged $155.65 on my credit card. I telephoned NYCbike and they told me I did not properly read the pricing instructions. The front page of the web site seems to trick a person into believing he/she will only be charged $10.00 for 24 hours. The customer service reps basically told me ""tough rocks sucker!"""

I bought a day pass to test out the service. Got in with no problems through the park. It was pleasant! On my way home was a completely different story. Tried to dock my bike and saw the little green light, but saw nothing on my app and the meter kept running. I called citibike immediately to make sure I didn't get charged extra. They told me there was nothing they could do. The customer service reps were beyond rude. They were yelling at me and interrupting-- I'm the one on the hook for bogus charges.

We checked out 3 bikes, and read 24-hour-pass... hey, using a bike within limits of 24 hours isn't so bad! We just need to wonder around a bit at Brooklyn. There is a station where NON of our credit cards can be read, and the docks are full so a lot of people are waiting to return the bike at the station whereas many people cannot check out bikes with their credit cards.But that's fine, we walked to another station (Columbia Heights & Cranberry St) and checked out the bike. We discussed about the route then had a lot of fun at Brooklyn. We finally decide to ride bike to grand central terminal! It is a 4h/17m/30s ride, within the 24 hour limit.Then the security deposit is never back. Not until I asked the customer service did I realize that there is an overcharge after every 30 minutes limit with in 24 hours!!So riding a very heavy and bad condition bike (without a lock) for a 4 hour ride cost us more than $100 each. What a great experience! It must be a genius to think up such a plan: promise a 24-hour pass, but you need to split your whole trip to small segments of 30 minutes, you must get to your destination and return the bike within that time. So if you need a bike in better condition, and don't want to have a 30 minute segmentation, just find a bike store or a rental bike service, that won't cost you that much and you get a better bike."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/15/2016,"Outstanding program.  I've used the bikeshares in Seattle Paris and Montreal and it compares favorably. My only complaint (and reason for not giving 5 stars) is that more effort needs to be made towards shifting bikes about.  Particularly in Montreal you see trailers moving bikes to where they are most needed. In Midtown at night its almost impossible to find a bike, or uptown to find a dock. The app works great to tell you where they are at but still, it can be really annoying. The concierge program is a great tool to mitigate against this."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/08/2017,Citi bike is a scam. I was in NYC last weekend thinking I could do a nice ride of Central Park and thought it was a great deal for a ride for only $12. No where was it clear to me that in order to have free rides you have to dock the bike back every 30 minutes. I ended up keeping the bike for about 2 hours and got charged the day fee plus the penalty. Shame on them for ripping honest tourists like myself off. I would have had a better price renting a bike from a bike shop. Buyers beware! You've been warned.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/24/2016,Horrid zero customer service will never use again charged for multiple bikes that i did not rent and the over charged for an additional 6 hours will never use again maybe it works for annual members

NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/29/2016,I've been wanting to use the bikes since they first parked in NYC a few years ago and today I got the chance to...it was such a fun time...my only thumbs down was having to replace the bike every 30 minutes though I had a day pass...it shouldn't be this way if you have a day pass you should be able to keep them out until you're ready to return it. This became an issue when we rode up the West side Hwy because there are really no bike stands there so we had to come off by 85th street and ride down the busy streets to look for a stand...but outside of this it was fun!!!
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/13/2013,"Rented bikes for an hour and rode around the West Side of Battery Park and it was glorious! After the fact that it took about a half an hour to rent the bikes.  The bike machine wouldn't take any of our credit cards but finally after a phone call to Customer Service, the woman was very apologetic, it finally worked!! It costs about $14 for the hour, which is sorta steep, but it was worth it since we had so much fun.  However, if it was something you see yourself doing more often, definitely get the yearly pass for $99, it will save you lots!"

NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/31/2017,Had a little trouble at first figuring out how it worked but that was due to my own tendency to ignore the details. Some experienced Citibike usersr helped me out and after that it was smooth pedalling. I didn't get penalized for going over the half hour per ride limit once thanks to the abundance of docking stations throughout the city and text alerts. it was oversll a great experience.
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/07/2013,"Update:  I have calmed down now that my key finally arrived. I feel very much like Mr. Sweetchuck in this scene from Police Academy whenever I'm riding a Citi Bike:  youtu.be/gGPde9vFoqcSo far, I have had two reactions from strangers watching me ride down the street on my Citi Bike. One dorky looking white guy tried to high-five me and said, ""yeah baby, Citi Bikes!""  Then a couple days afer, an angry looking black guy said to me as I cycled by, ""look at you all hard on your Citi Bike.""  Not sure what to make of any of this. But so far, my impressions are: The Good:1  .Being able to bike somewhere and then return the bike and not have to worry about locking it up and/or your bike getting stolen. Also, really like being able to bike one way and then take the subway or a cab the other way.  I also like biking for a while and then returning bike and jogging the rest of the way. 2.  Bikes are sturdy and the fat tires makes them more stable. 3.  Bikes don't go too fast so probably are safer. The Bad:1. These bikes are no fun to ride, are heavy, and don't go fast. Takes much longer to get from point A to point B, compared to my road bike. 2. Like i said, these bikes don't exude style...just a way to get around.3. Sometimes I return a bike, it locks into the dock, but I don't get a green light. This is unnerving. I wish you could use the app to see if they have the bike in their system as checked back in! (you can check the kiosk) 4. Skateboard PUNKS (I can say that, as I used to read Thrasher back in the day). Fast forward to angry old man me, and I have to say, I don't like how every 10 seconds these morons lose control of their boards and they go flying into the people on their Citi Bikes!5.  People on bikes are oblivious to other bikers and without mirrors there are going to be a lot of accidents revolving around passing."

I've sent more than 10 emails to them, and the fact that I literally get the same exact responses is nothing short of pathetic. They don't really care about their customers, and those copied and pasted responses clearly show that. They will tell that they re-balance the stations and are trying to improve the system, but after a year it only gets worse and I'm still waiting to see any station in the entire city getting re-balanced, just like the 30+ other users I've asked and also said they've never seen it. It's a lie and very disrespectful to their customers who are paying for a service that they can't use when they most need it.I won't be surprised if the bikes and stations start getting vandalized..."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/11/2014,"This is by far the worst bike sharing system I have ever used.  Between broken machines and bikes it's pretty much a crapshoot if you will be able to use it.  The sad thing is I used the bike sharing system in DC, which was made by the same vendor, and experienced none of these issues.  The idea is great and it works well in other cities, but New York just completely botched the execution."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/01/2014,"I wish I could give no star or even a negative star, if possible.  This review is specifically about their customer service & membership processes.  I paid for the annual membership over a month and a half ago and still have not received my member key.  I called in three times to at least get some updates on the status and no one gave me any details and kept saying I need to wait longer.  Also, they refused to take any action when I called in the third time (30 days after the purchase date) regardless of the abnormal delay on the delivery.Apparently what they say on the e-mail you get after paying for your annual membership is NOT TRUE.  When I got the e-mail, they said the member key should arrive within 3-5 business days.  When I called in after a week, they did NOT even send out the key yet.  I paid for my membership on Oct. 22 and my key was not sent out until Oct. 29.  I called in again a week after the day they declared they sent out and they told me to wait and call back if the key doesn't arrive within another week.  I waited for another 10 days and called in to check up on the status and ask if they can re-send the key and the only answer I got was wait till Friday evening, since it was Wednesday when I called.  (What kind of logic is this?)  I just gave up on arguing with them any more and decided to wait until I come back from Thanksgiving break.And... guess what? It's Dec. 1 and I still haven't got the key.  I'm done dealing with their failure with delivering what they advertised & promised and their terrible customer service.  I just sent out an email to their Customer Service and asked for a refund.  I liked the idea of Citi Bike, but I'm just going to ride on my own bike, since this is causing more trouble already than riding on my own.One last thing to add...  LOOK AT REVIEWS BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO PAY FOR THE ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP.  I overlooked reviews about customer service and I'm deeply regretting that I ignored."

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/01/2016,"Absolutely awful service! The kiosk is very unclear. It's absurd that you can only rent the bike for 30 min. Before you need to return the bike or be charged $4 per 15 minutes. $12 to rent a bike for 30min seems a bit high, on top of $4/15min. But I guess I should expect this from a bank, not here to help, just here to rip off more hard working people! Please rent from a local shop, they have better bikes."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/08/2014,"Great concept, mess of an operation.I love using bikes to get around the city. Citibike however is a terrible company.Here's why broken docks, broken machines that don't print receipts, and arbitrary late fees.I AM CURRENTLY DISPUTING A $108 LATE FEE THAT I DID NOT INCUR. I check to make sure the light turns green when I dock my bike each and every time. If it does not turn green I call a service agent. Citibike has a record of me calling pretty much every day.The day they are charging me the late fee for was a day that I used the bike twice. They have it on record that I called about the earlier trip because the light didn't turn green. They are claiming I had the same problem with my evening trip, that the bike wasn't docked. I call every time. As was proven earlier in the day. The is no way for the customer to prove that they docked the bike except call every trip and print out a receipt every trip. I do call so that proved a fail. I tried printing a receipt but the machine was broken. Also they never informed me or billed me about a late fee until 3 weeks after the incident.So basically Citibike can arbitrarily bill you late fees (and they will) and there is not way for the customer to prove that they are right. Also, the service agents are not helpful, are often rude when there is a problem and seem comfortable scamming customers.My credit card company is currently disputing this fee (as they have done in the past) and I am going to contact the Better Business Bureau today and report Citibike. I encourage all others who have been charged late fees wrongly to do the same.If anyone wants to file a complaint against Citibike to the Better Business Bureau, here is their official address (Citibike does not make it easy to find this info)CITIBIKE aka NYC BIKE SHARE77 COMMERCIAL STREETBROOKLYN, NY 11222718 237 2878"

Broken seats, broken peddles, flat tires run rampant. 4. I live on the upper east side. still no CitiBike 1 year on...My advice: find a cheap bike and buy a thick U-Lock.

The checking in every 30 minutes is a joke because it stresses you out trying to make sure you obey their rules. So back to my card not working. I tried to find an agent to help me like they did when I first rented the bike and gave them my money. Nope, only credit card stands. I called for help and waited on the phone for appx 5 minutes for someone to help. They made me use my credit card again to get a paper code to manually plug in numbers and I knew in the back of my mind it was not going to be good. I had to call them twice because the first set of numbers didn't work the second time. Well, come to find out I had to put my credit card in each time to receive new numbers. Really?  Yep, they charged me for exceeding the 30 minutes...twice. So will I ever do that again? Not on your life. I should have had a clue when the bikes were Citibank owned. I have never had a good Citibank experience."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/21/2017,"Worst experience ever! I will never use these bikes again, a cab is much cheaper and convenient. You need to use a battering ram and multiple attempts to dock this bulky over priced 30 minute ride. Even though you hear a click and think you've docked your bike, they will continue to charge you excess fees at the rate of $16.00 per hour. I had to drive an hour back to the city to re-dock a bike that had been sitting for over 5 hours in the same docking station. I'd give this review a zero if it were allowed"

NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/08/2014,"What a very fun surprise!! Biking in Manhattan!! I thought it was a crazy idea at first but after we figured out the un-docking process the fun began. Who knew that biking in Manhattan at 10PM on a Sunday night would prove to be such a good idea?!  Down load the app for your phone and set the timer.  IT's a blast!  Half the fun is looking for the next docking station.  The true test came Monday - a work day after Thanksgiving...so much more traffic.  While it's chaotic, the upside is that the traffic rarely moves very fast.  Great fun!! I highly recommend.  A great way to see, smell, and hear the city!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/11/2016,If you need a bike for 30 mins it's fine otherwise look elsewhere. We used them thru Central Park but you have to put them back every 30 minutes and the docking places are outside the park so you need to constantly be aware of time. We spent 1 hour and 45 mins we were late because we got lost in the park and was charge $26 for the 2 bikes then another $35 in overages. We could have rented other bikes for the day with helmets and locks for the same price. It was a rip off. Also you have to change your code for every new bike every 30 mins and put your credit card back in. That's if there are anybikes left and you have to wait 10 mins inbetween
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/02/2015,"This is ridiculous this is my first time and also will be last time in my life I ever use a citi bike. I got charge $50 for a 2.5 use!?!?!  The renting station is very confusing. Just read up some review knowing I am not the only one having this problem. We all thought $9.95 is for 24hr of use, but no you got to dock in your bike every 30min to stay to the $10 or you get will a overtime fee for every 30min this is so frustrating!!!!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/08/2016,"Unreasonable program where ""24 hour"" rental can still lead to overage charges! There is a requirement of re docking the bike every 30 mins, if it isn't redocked within that time frame, there are ""overtime"" fees associated. After re-docking the bike, the renter is required to use the terminal again and take out another bike code, for the same bikes that were just returned.None of this is clearly explained in the tiny, rushed atmosphere of renting locations. As a first time rider looking to explore the city, these kinds of requirements should be repeatedly, and clearly shown. I don't quite understand the requirement anyway as this is advertised as a convenient way of exploring the city, but how convenient is hunting down a docking station every 30 mins? My maybe 3 hour ride with 2 bikes ended up costing $25.68 for 2 bikes, plus overtime fees of $42.80 for each bike, totaling $111.28. I should have gotten on craigslist and bought 2 cheap bikes for that cost. The quality of the bike is subpar at best. They are heavy and hard to yield. Seat is uncomfortable to ride on for more than 10 mins. My wife had troubles trying to get on the bike on the lowest seat setting. She is about average height and has ridden plenty of other rental bikes without any issues. My overall experience was totally not worth it, and the final ""overtime"" charges will keep me away for good. Hopefully they get rid of these gotcha charges because the overall idea is great but implementation needs work."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/31/2014,"I am a fan of the Citi Bike program and NYC's bike lanes in general.  I give it four stars just for EXISTING, where other cities have nothing.  As someone who commutes via bicycle 40+ miles a day on the city streets of Los Angeles, I think the existence of this rental bike program, and the accompanying culture of biking that exists in New York, is fantastic.Is the program perfect?  Certainly not.  The computer kiosks are not at all intuitive for first-timers or out-of-towners.  You have to request a new ride code each time you want to get a bike, by first pressing ""request new ride code,"" and then inserting your (same) credit card.  Pull up your bike to a station that's full of bikes, just before your time is up?  Requesting more time via the kiosk is also extremely un-intuitive.  You might also find yourself wasting time trying to dock your bike at a dock that is... broken.  Which can add pressure if you are trying to cut it close up against your time limit.  So, not perfect.  The Citi Bike smartphone app is useful for find the numerous stations throughout the city.  The bikes I used were in good working order, and despite having come unprepared, I put in 20 miles wearing my Allen Edmonds dress shoes I enjoyed riding around the city so much.  The bike lanes in New York feel  safe-ish (if you watch for car doors and pedestrians) and there is a general feeling that bikes have a place on the city streets here, or at least more so than in other places.  Cars look out for bikes (more often than I am used to), and don't make deliberate attempts to kill you.I imagine this program has a 2.5 star review average because of how the kiosks and docks function (or, rather, how they don't function).  That's too bad, but don't let it discourage you from trying it out!"
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,07/06/2014,"I have very mixed feelings about these bikes. On the surface they seem like a very good idea and it is nice to be able to zip around the city on a bike. However be sure not to have the bike for longer than 30 mins or else you are smacked with a ""late fee"" and then 45 mins late from dipping your bike you get hit with another fee. These rules are extremely confusing at first but once you ride around for a few hours it is more understandable. I felt like the entire time I was riding, it was like a race against time, there wasn't a whole lot of ""let's enjoy this scene"". Instead it is ""where is the next station with a kiosk"", and that is another thing you only can grab a bike from a station with a kiosk or else your walking. Someone needs to go back to the drawing board and fix how this thing is operated."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/24/2015,"Their bloodsucking policy is the worst. They advertise this as a way to reach from point A to point B, however you have only half an hour to do that.

NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/20/2014,"I wish I could rate this higher- as I am a founding member and have wanted something like this for AGES. The problem is that the system is really unreliable...from there NEVER being bikes available in midtown Manhattan when I need them, to the app showing half full icons on docks that only have 2 available bikes- both of which are usually broken- to a general lack of cleanliness, these problems have plagued this system since the get go. There are always a ton of bikes at Port Authority and Penn Station, but no one uses them. They need to be rebalanced onto Broadway and 8th Avenue but they never are. The system is pretty irritating and good luck when you find a bike that works or are returning it- no guarantee the dock will work at all."

NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/06/2015,"A fantastic concept that is being badly let down by execution.I ride the citibikes almost everyday but there are a number of issues that need to be addressed before they continue with their expansion.1) the docking stations probably 40%-50% of them seem to be broken and you cannot dock your bike.2)The bikes are not being serviced with brake pads needing to be replaced, bikes having no bells and gearing broken on bikes.3) the grips are degradable which means you end up with this black rubber on her hands after every ride.4) bikes are not being replenished at stations (there should be a crew that can see if a station is empty then more bikes need to be delivered likewise if a station is full then take some bikes away.)If the managing company could resolve there services it would be a 5 stars but sadly they don't seem to be interested in resolving these issues but more concerned about emails on expansion."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/06/2016,"I love it. I signed up for the annual membership, and a month in it has paid for itself in my mind. Since moving to midtown, I rarely need to use the subway, but walking everywhere can take a chuck of time out of your (my) day, and that's how Citibike has really made an impact on my day-to-day life. My 30 minute walk to work, can be 10 minutes, if I want it to be, by hopping on a bike. I love that I don't own the bike, so I never worry about theft or maintainence. The only draw back is that in certain areas of the city at certain times of the day or night, I often catch the dicks completelt empty of bikes.  I get it, but it means riding instead of walking is not  a 100% certain thing, but so far, it's enough to make it very worthwhile for me. However, I now need to carry hand cleaner at all times."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/22/2013,"CAUTION: NO FEE APPEAL PROCESSLessons from Citi Bike: Any fee that you will incur, even if they are due to station/bike malfunction, will not be refunded - despite a supposed appeal process. After purchasing 2 one-day passes, I was charged $102 in late fees even though I did return the bikes on time. Upon contacting their call center, Vera Thompson - the office manager - refused to right the wrong. Disregarding my intentions to use Citi Bike again if she simply would correct the error, Ms. Thompson hung up the phone refusing to consider my request. She stated that I had misread the services agreement.After getting run over by Ms. Thompson and two of her office associates, I would NEVER trust this service again.

NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/15/2015,"While I understand some of the other reviewer's complaints, I thankfully had no issues using Citi Bike! I went to NYC this past weekend (Friday-Monday) and wanted to get a lot of sightseeing done. I knew that taking cabs or uber everywhere would cost a lot, but that walking would take up time and put a toll on my body. I was excited to see that there was Citi Bike, as I've used them in Miami.I signed up for a week-long pass, as I needed a solid 3 days of use. I stayed at the Waldorf, which was pretty centrally located and had a docking station at 52nd and Lexington that always had a fews bikes available and plenty of open docks for dropoffs. From here I biked pretty much everywhere throughout the weekend. What's important to remember is that these are meant to be commuting bikes so that is why only the first 30 minutes is included in your pass. Knowing this, I would purposely map out bike stations to switch out my bike whenever I knew that I'd be going for more than 30 minutes. This system never failed me. The only time I rode for more than 30 minutes was when I wanted to stroll through Central Park. I knew that I would be charged a surcharge, but honestly it only ended up being just under $5 so that was totally worth it. Overall, this was a great system for me. I usually arrived in to my destinations in about half the amount of time that it took my friends to walk or take cabs (they didn't feel safe riding in the streets with traffic). Just keep in mind, that I did most of my riding over the weekend, where I likely didn't have to deal with nyc commuters looking for bikes.They did place a $100 security deposit on my credit card; however, it only was a pending charge and never processed."

We rode from the East to West side, and then back to Columbus Circle via River Side Drive to return the bikes. I awoke to discover I was charged $125.99. As if NY residents need another corporation inventing ways to steal our hard earned cash."

I challenged them again and was told that a supervisor would phone me with 48 hours.  No call. More and more of my time is being wasted on this dispute which clearly should be decided in my favor.  Use your own bike is my advice."

NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,10/12/2013,"While in essence I love the concept and really enjoy the perk, there are details that need much cleaning. I can blog a long paragraph, rather I'll share the pros & cons.THE GOOD:+fantastic alternative to a cab/subway, especially when the weather is nice+convenience, with plenty of stations south of 59th street+great way to encourage a fun/healthy activity and means for people to see our incredible city+very reasonably priced yearly unlimited pass+solid telephone customer service+bells and whistles, literally, and 3 gearsTHE BAD:-ability to manipulate/lock up a bike for 6 hours by hitting the repair button, reducing access-requirement for non-members and members to check in every 30 and 45 min, respectively-no stations (yet) above 59th street, while the park may be one of the most ideal places for ridersTHE UGLY@despite bike lanes, reckless street riding, drivers don't expect you, cabbies don't care and there are some really whacky crossover patterns - a bit dooming, most aren't even wearing helmets, this is likely to result in a few catastrophes unless something changes@now you can behave like the crazy delivery boys, flying through red lights, almost hitting pedestrians, no regard"
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/19/2016,Used to be a casual user of Citi Bike - as I travel frequently yearly membership wasn't necessary but weekly 'rental' for $25 was good value and encouraged me to use the scheme.But now they've done away with the weekly rental ($24 for 3 days is way too expensive) I never use it.Other schemes in cities around the world are much more affordable and actually encourage people to cycle rather than crowd transportation - which I thought was the whole point.London is £2 ($3)/day!!! This should't be a profit making scheme! Much cheaper and more convenient to simple buy a bike - even if it gets stolen after a few weeks - still works out cheaper!
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/10/2016,"This is the 2nd time I have had a problem, and I am a 'founding' member.  First, they once told me the bike had not been docked, which was incorrect.  Lucky for me, I returned to the station and the bike was there, and locked.Worse, on 5/28/16 i noticed that the 'inside' of my key, the side with the scanner, had disappeared.  I went to get a bike rack and, voila, no key scan.  I contacted them on 5/28/16.  They told me i would have a new key within a week.  It is now 13 days.  I called today and was told 'I would have a new key within a few days'.  I use the bikes frequently, and am never comfortable with their procedures.  From the beginning, I feel the program has been run poorlyOn another note, let's get enforcers on segways to patrol the bike lanes.  There are going to be more accidents: bikes going against the traffic, pedestrians walking in the bike lane, and trucks (TRUCKS AND CARS) freely parking in the lane, which forces the biker into the mainstream traffic.  Hand out tickets for truck and cars: $100.1st offense.  Tix for those going against the traffic: $25/1st offense.  This would prevent accidents.The out of town experience is totally unfair.  More on that later."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/03/2015,"If I were able to assign negative stars, I would!! Outrageously poor customer service. It advertises $9.99 for 24 hours! I was charged a $202 ""hold"" on my account as well as an additional $89.00 for elusive fees that are not clearly explained on the kiosk or by the customer service personnel. Beware of this extremely deceitful bike rental!!! On top of that, many bikes are in ill repair with missing or malfunctioning parts. Will NEVER use this service again and I hope at least some people see this and can choose wiser transportation because of it."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/23/2013,I give it a five star because I've experienced a similar system and loved that system as much and I want to offset some of the angrier reviews. Let me set you straight on what to expect:Watch for:1) Red lights. That means the bike docked there will not come out.2) Make sure the green light goes on when you return your bike.3) FULL Kiosks of bikes. That means that no one was able to pull out a bike from there.4) Empty Kiosks of bikes. That means too many people come there and the bike you just docked will be snatched by someone else while you wait on line to get your next five digit code.Do this:1) Preplan your route a little bit so that you can not worry about the 30 minute limit.2) Choose a bike already adjusted to your height. Those seats are not that easy to adjust.3) Use the app. It is actually moderately accurate and it helps you find your way to the next kiosk.These bikes are good for what they are. They are a great way to travel around the city and enjoy the sites without worrying about your bike being stolen. You just dock it instead of locking it. Want to just pick up from another kiosk? Sure! I can't wait for this whole place to be full of kiosks. Bike more! It's good for you. Let's all work together to develop a common bike culture that is POLITE! Don't be a Jerk. Don't be THAT biker.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/11/2015,"What a FARCE!!!! Basically, they make you think you're renting a bike for 24hrs for $10, but in reality you can only use it for 30 min increments over the next day. We used a couple bikes for 2 hours and got charged $100. It's worth adding that I'm the type that takes my time reading basic terms or directions thoroughly when it comes to anything, and they certainly got me. They need to do a much better job of clearly conveying their business model, because the perceived bait-and-switch method is not going to be sustainable, regardless of their intentions. Surprised Citi would want their name associated with such a poorly reviewed service."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/08/2015,"NEVER EVER AGAIN. These people should be sued for false advertising. They lie and try to take advantage of you. DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY. Its NOT 9.95 for 24 hours. Its 9.95 AND THEN they will nickel and dime you with ridiculous charges. If you bike for more than 30 minutes expect to be robbed. Who bikes in 30 minutes increments?! Tell me who?!? Citi bike has a horrible, very greedy and just plain criminal business model. I don't understand how they are allowed to operate. Currently they are holding 100 dollars of MY money for ""8 business days"" for ""service charges"" WHAT A SCAM. I should have just bought a bike at this rate. SCAM ARTISTS!!!!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,11/29/2013,"Citi Bike is a great transit option at a great price.   For $99 a year, I can now commute by bike cheaper than any other transit option besides walking.  For what repairs to my personal bike cost, it's even cheaper than riding my own.  Docking stations are convenient to almost all of Manhattan below 59th St.  I have not had a hard time finding a bike more than once or twice, and I've always ended up finding one without too much difficulty.  The bikes themselves are durable, but bulky three-speed touring bikes.  On my racing bike I can make it from 34th Street to South Ferry in 17 minutes -- on Citi Bike: 35 minutes.  On my bike I'm faster than a subway -- on Citi Bike I must allow a few extra minutes.  The upside of a slower, heavier bike is that it's a bit safer, and a better work out.  It's also a shame that they haven't worked the bikes into the park system yet.  Above Stuyvesant H.S. there are not bikes on the waterfront in Hudson River Park and there are not bikes in Central Park (which is above 59th).  Upper Manhattan needs access to Citi Bike.  Also, Lower Manhattan can only be accessed by the perimiter; there are no functional bike routes through the Financial District.  Most of the reserved bike lanes are a joy to ride.  The shared lanes, especially on the more crowed streets, like Chinatown, can be harrowing.  Also, above 34th Street, even the dedicated lanes can be overrun by pedestrians, push carts and skateboarders - easier to stick to the rivers.The 45 minute thing doesn't bother me.  Doesn't stop me from re-docking every half hour to keep the bike as long as I need.  It does prevent people from taking the bike out of commission all day when it should be circulating.  (If you plan to picnic, dock your bike and pick up a fresh ride later.)Overall, I'm an instant fan.  Citi Bike is my new normal.  I'll even ride as often as I can force myself through the winter.  There is no better way to enjoy and access Manhattan from the Battery to Midtown."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/25/2013,"Well I will upgrade my review to 2 stars, Now the ""Fat Jew"" (comedian)  gives the  homeless  a  cycling  class to lose weight. That is  a plus! youtube.com/watch?v=leTiYelp took down my original review they will probably take this down too! Someone at Yelp is obsessed with flagging me instead of doing good reviews or making sure Elites have pictures up or something along those lines they are obsessed with flagging my reviews. Anyway check out the video it's hilarious!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/24/2013,"I really like Citi Bike.I think this program is great for the City.Let me start by saying that it is VERY annoying to lose parking on the streets.  Let me also say that I am against any plan to take cars out of the city.  This review is about Citibike.  Not about mayoral plans, and people's demons.That being said, I have been quite annoyed about the difficulty in finding parking since they have taken spots away in the East Village for bike racks.  As a result, I have had to have my car parked elsewhere many times.  This has caused some delay in my getting to the office at times.Such being the case, I have decided to get a Citi Bike membership and use the Bikes to get around during the day.I got an annual membership.  The delay in receiving my key was serious.  I waited several weeks.  Though they were giving out keys in Union Square park, I was told I had signed up several days too late to get a key from the nice people at the table.I later in the program with others used a daily pass.  This was a huge source of frustration as many of the card readers don't work properly.  Sometimes, you have to walk to another Citibike Station.My annual pass uses a key fob which I can put into a slot and get a bike.  So far, with this exception of two stations, this has worked amazingly well.  I have taken approximately 25 trips to date and this program is FANTASTIC.  I find that most of the people with opinions of the program, have not actually immersed themselves in the experience of it.The west side highway bike paths are amazing.  On a sunny day, you can go from battery park to the intrepid.  At 10pm, you can do the same.  It is AMAZING.  You can stop.  You can hop from place to place.  It is truly an amazing way to enjoy the city.  The best part is, you don't have to spend anything over your membership fee.  Such being the case, I found that the weekends that I used Citibike, I actually saved a significant amount in transportation costs.Also, I often would not just ride from one street to another.  I would go on bike adventures and dock for five minutes before continuing on.  The 30 minute day pass makes that a little annoying but the 45 minute annual pass fits just right.  You can get a long way in 40 minutes before worrying about a dock.I took a star off the five because there are still glitches in the system and the equipment.  However, it was a great experience and I really did not have an open mind going in.  I still hate losing parking.  I still get annoyed when the red light flashes rather than the green.  It gives me pause when my bike locks but I get no confirmation from a green light saying that I can leave and the docking process has completed.  However, the benefits if you really make an effort to enjoy the bikes, far outweigh the minuses.  I plan to take a trip to Brooklyn this week (from Manhattan on the bikes) and will update this review if necessary.The other major concern I have has to do with poor people in this City.  I do not have a magic answer, but though the Citibike program is in public housing developments (There are bikes in public housing, even behind my mother's apartment), there is not a system in place for poor people to use the bikes.  The last sentence is not entirely accurate (there is a discounted annual cost for NYCHA residents and members of certain credit unions).  In theory, these mechanisms are sufficient for gaining access to the program.  However, a survey I have taken of several public housing residents (people I know) has really uncovered not just antagonism to the program (which seems to stem from media portrayals of the program) but actual frustration in the fact that they don't have the ability to try it.  I know it is a Citibank sponsored program, but many economically challenged people do not have bank accounts.  Further, even if the events planned in these developments include the ability to sign up for free accounts which will allow for participation, many of the events are scheduled for July, which will logistically mean missing another 20-30 days of riding for people who will then have to wait for a debit card and subsequently a bike key.  I don't have a magic answer, but I believe if this is supposed to be a public service, the time is now to use the system to help empower those who may be locked out due to economic hardship to overcome those obstacles.  I personally don't believe the program has any duty to do these things, but I believe that the opportunity to help people do more than ride a bike has presented itself.  The program should work to better implement in communities in which this program would empower people to get to work, school, and new opportunities for less money than a metrocard."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/02/2013,"Once upon a time, on a crappy day, my boyfriend and I decided to rent some bikes and try to have some fun in the city. The machine screen took forever to work properly and we had to get 3 tickets because the codes werent working.   After 15- min, we finally got our bikes and started to happily ride them, we were a little worried about the time, so we found another station and returned our bikes.   For our surprise, when we tried to take new bikes out, we werent able to! All bikes were displaying red lights after we inserted the code and we ended up going back home and deciding not to rent a bike ever again from citibike."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/14/2017,so far very good experience! loved to ride my first time! :)  absolutely recently recommended! ride safe!
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/28/2013,"After a few weeks I have to downgrade my review down to one star.  There are just way too many glitches in the system, and as more and more people have signed up there are way too many empty/full racks and not enough rebalancing teams moving bikes around as necessary.The only improvement they've made is adding capacity to the support hotline, instead of waiting 45 minutes to speak to someone you now never have to wait more than 30s."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/14/2013,"First off, the options are confusing. IF I have a 24hr pass does that mean I can keep the bike for 24 hrs? or does that mean that I have to still keep docking it to keep using it? When will there be a single ride option? 10.00 + 101.00 debit card hold is ridiculous if you just want to try it out. How is this not CHEAPER than the train or the bus? Why is it not available or any planned stations further than 60th street? So again the upper part of Manhattan gets the shit stick. I would have loved this program if there was a single ride option - CHEAPER than the train or bus. And if there were stations near me * upper 110's*. Now I get perhaps that they are placing them with more populated areas... but see, then why have you torn up my streets to put in fucking MILES of bike lanes with no intention of placing something like this near them? hmmm.... and I think placing a 101.00 HOLD on your card kinda eliminates the common person that barely is making ends meet, which the bikes would have helped them. Alot of people still use CASH ( I don't as much but I do know my neighborhood is mostly all CASH only places).in any case. Love the idea, but will see how the working get developed."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/03/2013,"I'll wade into the subjective waters on this, since Grant's review perfectly sums up the facts and details of the bike share. I don't mind getting opinionated on something I love this much--after all, we're on Yelp.After using the Bixi bike share system in Montreal two years back for an entire vacation (literally, we took them everywhere we needed to go), I was 100% sold on bike shares and having a program in NYC. I waited and prayed, and although I'm never one to salivate over huge corporations slapping their name all over a good thing, I was ecstatic when I found out NYC was going to get a large-scale bike share. It's a profoundly easy, healthy, affordable, and beautiful way to see any city, but especially one as crowded as New York. Subways get aggressively packed and torturous in the warm weather, driving means a constant game of ""which streets are impassable,"" and riding my own cycle means always worrying about damage, theft, and finding a legit bike rack. Walking is a wonderful means to get around the city, but cycling is really my ideal method of moving from point A to point B. You can stop whenever you want, you can be fast, slow, on time, late, it's all up to you. You cover more ground. And a bike share enables you to reap all the benefits of riding a bike in a city without any of the worry about carrying a lock and stressing about coming back to a stripped frame. I took my first ride this past weekend, from the 34th street ferry pier down to Wall street, and it was fantastic. I was transported back to my vacation in Montreal--no worrying about train lines or walking 10 miles, just pure cycle transportation. We definitely ran into a few hiccups--one station by Liberty and Broadway was totally non-functional, another by Battery Park City gave us red lights on our fresh pass-codes until we retried the whole process from the start. And our final docking point at west 14th street gave me a yellow light but wouldn't let me remove and re-dock the bike. But in the end we figured it all out, and I'm still 100% supportive of this program. Will Citi Bike mean the removal of some local bike racks? Probably. The loss of valuable parking spots? Absolutely. The fiery-eyed malice of some NIMBY residents? You already know. But once we get past the initial kinks, this will be a perfect addition to NYC's intricate transportation network--it will bridge commute gaps and allow everyone to see their city in a new (and, I believe, better) way. My one real suggestion is that they increase the time for both pass and member riders by 15 minutes each (making it 45 for pass-holders and 1 hour for members...NYC is a big place).Here are my PRO-TIPS for newcomers:- Download the ""City Bikes"" and ""Ride the City"" apps for station locations and best routes. The Citi Bike app kind of sucks and is quite crash-prone.- Always check over the bike(s) BEFORE paying/undocking. This way you'll have a winner without starting your timer (passes get 30-minute trips, annual members get 45-minutes per ride). This means checking the tires for good pressure, the bell, brake tension, seat height (remember your number for future rides) and spinning the wheels to make sure they're not bent or have locked-up brakes.- Plan your route before undocking to avoid dreaded u-turns and stops that lead to late fees on your trip- Lift the bike back from underneath the saddle and pull back on the handlebars to undock. Use a bit of force to knock it back into the dock when finished- Make good use of your bell, stay away from driver-side car doors, always stop at red lights (and avoid the $200 ticket I once had to pay), and never swerve through crowds of people.- Be patient and open-minded. This is a new thing for NYC, and it takes some time to make it all work smoothly. Don't hate the whole idea of a bike share just because you have a few problems here and there--it'll get sorted out soon enough.- Wear a helmet. Seriously. Even if you think it's ridiculous. Better yet, if you're laughing right now, go to a LBS to get fitted for your proper size because I'm certain you have no idea how to wear one properly."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,11/04/2015,"This may be a useful service for those in town for a few days, but I would recommend just going to a local business. I tried to use it for commuting to work but after two weeks had so many technical difficulties I had to go back to public transportation. Two days ago I got a broken bike, docked at the next station and was told I had to wait 2 minutes before renting another bike. Ten minutes later I still couldn't get a new bike and had to walk another ten minutes to the next station, making me late for work. Today I docked my bike, got the ""green light"" that it was secure, then four hours later received an email that my bike hadn't been returned. The customer service rep insisted I hadn't gotten a green light. Curious how they are so confident in their technology when they must know all the issues that people are having."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,11/04/2015,"This could be a great thing but poor customer service and logistics are not letting it live up to it's potential. I use Citibike around Manhattan and as part of my daily commute. Unfortunately, there are issues with getting the bikes where they need to be. There are at least 6 docks within 2 blocks of Penn Station. When getting in to Penn Station before 7am I should be able to find a bike closer than the 6 blocks I have to walk regularly. When attempting to return them in the West Village or East Side I find where all the bikes actually are as it's difficult to find an empty dock to drop off. Emails and calls to the customer service line go without a response. Very unfortunate that such a spectacular idea is being so terribly mismanaged."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,12/30/2013,"Oh Citi Bike, was there a more polarizing program over the past year?There's still so much that has to be tweaked with this bike sharing program, but I still stand firm in believing that we are saving the planet and helping people get around a little easier by having it available to us. The biggest problem for me is still the lack of docking stations. It's just not practical to get to a station and not have an open dock to leave the bike! Even if the research shows less demand in certain areas, you need to think ahead and add more docks there anyway! Many folks are using these bikes to get to work and it's an added stress to get there and have to wait for a spot to open or scour the area for another station. Please add more docks in more locations, including parts of Brooklyn, and this will eventually be 5 stars because it's a GREAT idea. It stays at 3 for now as a tourist attraction and not a guarantee for people who live here and rely on it as a form of transportation...You can't keep every irresponsible rider from getting on one of these, so I'm not factoring in the hazard they bring to the road, but with adjustments over time this will be a great addition to our city."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/29/2014,"I think this is a great service. So many stations and for short journeys of 30mins or less it was great. There were times that the bikes wouldn't come out, there were times where the racks were full or empty, but at the end of the day we got by. We also saw some people stealing the bikes by lifting them up and out of the holders. I hope they fix this so that prices stay low. Also they need to improve their App. It doesn't centre to where you are, and the direction function doesn't work on my iPhone 6plus. Overall riding around nyc was the highlight of the trip (aside from getting engaged!)."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/23/2013,Amazing idea with very poor execution. Stations malfunction with glitches and many bikes display red lights meaning something is wrong with them. Recently spent nearly 2 hours going to 5 different stations trying to rent bikes with a friend.I purchased the one-year membership and I'm considering getting a refund.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,11/05/2014,"believe it or not, dependng on where you are & time, depends if you get a bike, and depending on where you are & time , depends if you get parking for the bike!!! Especially DOWNTOWN NYC! Bit problematic however the idea is amazing and must give props to that."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,02/14/2014,"4.5 round up.  Oh the subway money you save...Aside from the $$ saved (which you can then use on food and drink!!!), Citibike provides a practical, healthy way of transportation. I'm lucky and found a great deal - $50 for a year - on Gilt.  Citi Bike saves me the anxiety of having my own bike locked up outside, and lights on the bikes ensures that I have a safer night ride.  There are definite downsides, such as certain empty docks during morning hours when people are commuting to work, but over these couple months they've become pretty diligent on relocating bikes from full stations to empty ones.  If you need to dock a bike but arrive at a full one, you can get an extra 15 min. or so to find another dock.  The downside is that some docks just don't lock and you have no choice but to try another one.  What's most appealing is the amazing customer service.  I've encountered an array of problems including arriving at a dock only to discover it's boxed in by 3 feet of snow, or my key card doesn't work.  I don't know who trains them, but the call center people are the calmest, kindest call center people ever.  One thing I wish they would do is set up more docks in the Greenpoint area, where the food and art scene is growing.  I'd have to bike over a bridge to get there but....it still beats taking the G Train ;)"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/10/2015,"What a deceptive pricing structure.  $9.95 for unlimited 24 hours???  Oh, but you have to stop and turn the bike in every 30 minutes or you pay exorbitant fees.  Hard to believe this is legal.  I hope once the word gets out, they will have to make a change.  I paid the 9.95 plus an additional $13.00 for 45 minute overage.  I could care less about the money, it's the fact that this was not clearly disclosed at the bike station.  I'll rent from the bike vendors that rent from the closets before I ever give CitiBikes my money."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/06/2015,"Citibikes works fairly well overall.  But for users who rely on Citibikes for commuting, fairly well is not enough.  I began using the bikes for my commute from Grand Central to downtown Manhattan.  For the first year, no real problems.  This year, no bikes at Grand Central. Not one at the over 100 available bike racks at Pershing Square North and South. Not on 43rd and Vanderbilt. Not at any stations nearby. I have emailed and called in numerous complaints, but it has not helped.  The customer service center, located in North Carolina apparently, can only send emails to the ""re-balancing"" unit, same as the customers.  Its a shame because I see approximately 10 bikers scrambling around looking for bikes each day to get to their jobs.  Citibikes is losing customers, not gaining them.   Today, for example, I checked the app and website starting at 5 a.m.  I stopped at 7:30 a.m, no bikes were restocked at Grand Central during that time period.  How can Citibikes hope to be in existence if the busiest bike racks in the city are not stocked during rush hour? Not having bikes at Grand Central during the morning commute is just insane.Sounds like the program is self-sabotaging intentionally.  Maybe the powers that be do not want the program around."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/01/2014,This concept and company is awesome!!! So easy to use and cheap . Cost 9.95 for a day and so worth it . I'm visiting my from Cali and between the trains and buses it gets expensive . Great deal and you get to see so much more of the city with them . Multiple locations and they have an app for the iPhone so you and find drop off locations all over the place !!! I will defiantly be using this company forge remainder of my stay and the next time I come back !!! Awesome idea !!!
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/15/2015,Total rip off. Very unclear information on that you basically have to bring back your bike every 30 minutes before ending up with charges of crazy fees on the bikes. We've only rented 2 bikes for about 2 hours and being charged crazy amount of money. Never again!!Unfortunate to see that companies trying to make money by ripping off people.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/06/2013,"I took my first Citibike out today from 51st & 5th to Union Square and it was a blast.  I had no trouble finding a spot to park my bike at the docking station (16th & 5th).  I wish there was some kind of paper that spit out of the machine to give you your passcode.  Other than that, I'm excited about the option to ride a bike.  It took me only 15 minutes to get to Union Square.  The bike is very heavy but that's to be expected since they have to be sturdy.  It's definitely not very nimble but I enjoyed my ride and I got my heart rate up.  I've ridden my bike all over Manhattan when I lived in the city and like then, the biggest challenge is pedestrians.  They're just not looking for bicycles so you have to be careful but that has nothing to do with Citi Bike. An option to rent a helmut might  be a good idea."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/30/2015,This is such a stupid concept. All it does is waste parking spaces. You can't use the bike more than 30 minutes with out absurd over charge fees. Why not have a program to rent for Leisure riding since if you are a tourist that is convenient ..As always in New York- nothing is easy and you spend half hour time on phone with customer service .. Either get rid of program or make it useful
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/24/2013,"I like Citibike, easy way to get around, great cheap yearly plan, easiest way to get across town, it is great, EXCEPT... when you are a few minutes from home and every rack is full in the East Village!  I went around for an extra 25 minutes looking for a rack to park the bike, I went to 6 racks in the area and found nothing, and the ones that were available did not work.  Oh well... still a work in progress but I'm still a fan.And to the little punk putting dirty sticky stuff on the seats of all the Citibikes in the East Village, karma will catch up to you!"
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/24/2016,"Long overdue that I update this review.  They made all the changes I wished for and more.   Theyve implemented valet system to deal with overcrowded docks, they've improved docking with beeps so you know it worked.  They've dramatically improved coverage all over the city including in Williamsburg.  The annual cost increased to $160 but that is worth every penny.  It has saved me thousands on cab rides and given me the super power of being able to cut accross town in traffic jams in minutes.   Its given me breezy pleasure rides all over the city.  Its allowed me the peace of mind to know I can get the 30 blocks from my office to my son's school in an emergency in 10 minutes, a trip that would be 20 minutes by cab and 30 by public transit.    Its given me the option of a quick 2 minute ride up to the L train instead of the usual plodding 8 minute walk.   Its given me the convenience of open jawed transit when I enjoy the downhill ride one way and not the uphill ride back :)   Instead of wandering around with my old bike looking for somewhere to lock it for 15 minutes and wrestling the$100  lock around it and still not knowing if it will be there when i get back, with citi i can just click it into place and forget about it.    I LOVE CITIBIKE!!!!!!  NOTE: This is a review of the ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP.  I dont have to deal with any nonsense like entering codes,  I have no interface with the screen.    I just have to dip the FOB and go.  I highly recommend the annual membership."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/13/2013,"I bought an annual membership in mid-June, and despite a warning about a 10-day wait, it arrived in exactly a week.  On my first day using Citibike I rode from eastern Prospect Heights to FiDi in Manhattan, and then to Bed Stuy.  The journey took me through 3 bikes, and a short subway ride because of a rain burst, but was overall a positive experience.  First, and for me a slight negative, is that these bikes are VERY heavy.  I've been riding in the city for about a year, and had a hard time initially mounting and steering the bike because of it's unusual weight.  Once I figured that out, it was relatively smooth sailing.  Because it did take so long to adjust to the bike, I found myself close to the 40 minute mark as I approached the Brooklyn Bridge, so I had to stop and swap out bikes near the bridge to avoid running over time.  But the swap was a breeze.On the way back from Manhattan, it started raining.  I had the freedom to just corral the bike into the Citi bike stand and jump on the subway.  The wait for the subway at Manhattan's Fulton street, quickly reminded me of what a drag it is to ride subways on the weekend.  Most of the train lines had been diverted because of weekend construction, and I had to wait on a too hot and too crowded 2/3 platform for what seemed like 20 minutes for a train.  Once in Brooklyn, I stopped at Trader Joes @ Atlantic and Court Streets.  I would eager to see if my single paper bag of groceries would fit into the Citibike basket.  I was able to just squeeze it in there, and ride a Citibike home."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/11/2015,"Since they updated the stations' systems my experience has been much better. In the past, I would struggle to take bikes out or return them to the stations' slots. Many slots would be broken and I would frequently get a red light while trying to take bikes out. Now, I don't really have that problem anymore, but I am disappointed with the new bike designs. I can feel that the new bikes have much better brakes, which have drastically reduced stopping distance while retaining control (helps with close calls with tourists). However, the weight of the bikes remains unchanged. These bikes are so unbelievably heavy!!!!! They are ok on downhills and flat ground but even the slightest incline is sure to work up a sweat. Even moving them in or out of slots can be a workout. I also wish they could go faster, maybe a 4th gear? I am considering canceling my membership and buying my own bike due to the weight. It is really bothering me.Edit: I cancelled my membership. The bikes are just too freaking heavy, it's not pleasurable to ride. Even in third gear you'll be pedaling very hard yet the bike barely moves. It's just a pathetic design. Also, if you ever get in a dispute with them good luck. There's no way to appeal, they just take money out of your account. This will definitely lead to a lawsuit someday."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/19/2017,"Because I work later hours, there are usually no bikes available (although there were plenty when I first joined).  Complaints to CitiBike have been largely ignored and they won't let me out of my yearly contract, so I'm forced to pay every month for something that isn't even available to me.  Huge waste."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/08/2013,"I feel like I need to write two separate review for the two experience I had with Citi Bike.On day one we decided to try this out to get around as opposed to paying $2.50 every time we hopped on the subway. What we loved about this program is the designated bike lanes on the NY streets which made it safer to navigate all of the streets. Each station had a map that showed us what was around and where the closet station were. We had such a great time going from neighborhood to neighborhood. It was so easy to use the system, I even raved about it on Facebook because I liked it that much. It was also just fun to be on a bike again. There were plenty of biked and docks at each station, it seemed to seamless. I could give it 5 stars hand down.On day two we went out to the closet Citibike station and no bikes were there even though the app said that there were 18 bikes available. So i checked the app and it said there were 6 at the next station but when we walked there - No bikes. This happened at the next 5 stations. It was so frustrating to find station after station empty. When we finally found one with bikes, it was out of order, this happened with the next three stations. Twice I tried to call customer service to get a sense of what station we could find bikes and twice I waited for 20+ minutes before hanging up. We ended up just taking the metro which was disappointing because we had paid for a 24 hour pass and only had the chance to use it for 6 hours. Eventually we found some bikes in Times Square and rode the back to our hotel. Today I would give it 1 star. So there it is 5 stars for one experience, 1 star for the other. Now granted my first one was in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday and the next one was in the morning on a weekday - so I only thought it fair to average the ratings."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/14/2015,"I've been a member for a year and a half and up until yesterday I've had few problems.Yes, it's true that sometimes it can be hard to find a free docking station and individual docks sometimes don't work. Yesterday, however, I took a bike at 14th street and fifteen minutes later docked it at 29th street.The next day I got an email from Citi bike saying that I hadn't returned the bike and they were charging my card  for all the hours until  the bike is returned. I emailed back explaining what I had done. It took another day for them to get back to me, saying that the bike had turned up and my card had not been charged. Nevertheless I spent an uncomfortable day thinking that I would be charged $1500 for a stolen bike. It turned out OK in the end. But because you don't get a receipt when the bike is returned I had no way to prove that what I said was true. This has soured me a bit on what has been a great and inexpensive way to get around town."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/09/2013,"After a month of using the citibike, I have become obsessed.I check the the site and the internet for news of their progress installing new stations nightly.Of course, citibike is being tight lipped.  So excited for further penetration into Williamsburg.I have the yearly pass, which makes checking the bikes out super quick. I remember with frustration the long process getting a code to check out a bike before my yearly pass card came.  The bikes are heavy and the tires are often low.  You have to learn the quirks of your neighborhood.  I have been leaving for work earlier since you can't get a bike after 9 AM in the Williamsburg side of the Williamsburg bridge.But after two weeks of commuting to Wall Street on a citibike, I can see the changes in my figure.  it beats the subway.  It's faster for me to bike to work than take the subway.  it's cheaper, and I get a workout.  I'm debating purchasing a better lighter bike.  But I love the dock it and forget about it convenience of citibike.The other night I had a really great experience with citibike. I was able to get from 16th and Union Square West to Washington Square Park South in 5 minutes.  Try that walking or in a cab.  For short trips with less popular stations, you've hit the jackpot.I may end up getting a bike, but use citibike as well.  For my morning commute, a faster, lighter bike would be nice.  but then maybe it wouldn't be such a great workout.    And if I get a good bike, I'll have to worry about theft or vandalism.Really, I hope that citibike takes some of the 10 million in subscription fees to add more stations and hire more bike maintainers.  It's been frustrating the lack of communication.  They say they're going to double the number of stations.  But they don't say when.  Can't you just give us a hint of the timeline?I'm a fan, but hoping for better management."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/05/2013,I as charged $8 for being 7 seconds and 14 seconds over...Customer service WHAT THE FUCK!!!I have used bike system in Paris and in Montreal that where much easier and cheaper.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/18/2013,"I enjoyed my week on a citibike, it came in handy at times. The locations were plentiful, and the bike was a lot of fun. I'm sold. The advantages outweigh the drawbacks, and I'm glad these bikes are keeping this city out of the red."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/26/2016,"What a rif off.  First off,   the bikes are awful and there is no where to park them.  so if you plan on saving time by using one of these to commute, think again.  you won't be able to find a place to dock them once you take them out.  On top of that if you go over 30 minutes, be prepared to get ripped off.  We rented two bikes for 24 hours.  We went over the 30 minutes by 11 minutes and we were charged $43.  Stay away from this crooked bike share program.  this is what happens when you mix a bank with biking.   Rent a bike from a local bike rental shop."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/21/2015,"waste of money. Overcharge fees can exceed the daily rate, you can't bike anywhere north of 57th, and you have to constantly return the bike, wait 2 minutes, and then take out the same bike if you wanna bike any significant distance. Go to Talent Cycles or any other reasonable bike rental for a 24 rental that includes a helmet and lock and enjoy your freedom."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/16/2015,"As what others complaining about the overcharged fees and deposit, but I felt grateful that I spoke with a customer representative  which  polite and professional and he helps me to submit the refund! Thank you!"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/26/2013,"Disappointed in the overall operations but still love the concept and suspect it will continue to catch on.Considering Citi Bike services are provided by the same company (Alta Bicycle Share) that has been providing these services for large cities globally for many years, I'm constantly surprised that the operations aren't as smooth as they should be. This is not a new concept. I've used them in Montreal, Paris, and Melbourne and always had great experiences. So I was thrilled when I heard they were coming to NYC. Considering Alta's vast experience and all of the cities previously launched, one would think the kinks in service would have been worked out but (1) the app is definitely never reliable, (2) there are often broken bikes that can't be retrieved, and (3) it's very common to find a station completely FULL when you need to return a bike and completely EMPTY when you need to pick one up.The one time I did have to call customer service (which granted was the same day they launched) they were a bit clueless with how to even help me. After checking that my key was active, they basically just told me to go try a different station, which I did, and I was able to retrieve a bike. Good thing the stations are plentiful and not too far from one another."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/13/2013,"Pros: its cheap, its fun, healthy, its a great thing the city has sponsored, cons:* DEEP BREATH*  - they held 100$ DEPOSIT FOR 8 DAYS!! customer service is confused, you have to dock your bike EVERY 30 mins, so if you dont know the city, this is not for you, sometimes the docks dont work!! by the time you call customer service 30 mins are up, you are more worried to dock your bike than to enjoy the experience of riding through the city. its only for mid to downtown, SO if you live uptown manhattan there is no bikes (not surprised) .... if your bike gets stolen or whatver they can charge you $1000 FOR A RAGGEDY bike. OVERALL i like it but would not recommend it for a tourist, this is more ideal for a person who knows the city, has little trips to make, perhaps lives and works in the mid to downtown area then this would be ideal.  Its very cheap, and healthy so i enjoyed it but its more to run errands than anything."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/04/2013,"I love citibioke. I like the concept. I feel its a great parallel transportation system which has the potential to become as useful as the subway. I love the part where its a flat 100$ fee. .The one way rental is also an amazing concept. The only problem is that some racks are full, and they may want to reconsider their disribution of bikes, but thats a small problem, not worth taking a star away."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/08/2015,"I really thought this would be a fun experience, I'll just save you some time DON'T :("
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/09/2013,It's been a couple of weeks now riding the Citibike and with it's growing popularity i've seen instances of full docks or no bikes when i need one especially during rush hour. In residential areas i'm seeing not enough bikes in the morning and in corporate areas full docks. Also some maintenance issues with the bikes as well. As with any new service they have to work out the kinks and hopefully the demand will be met. Still a fan though but due to it's growing pains i'll have to drop it down a star.
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/04/2013,"I am giving my review as a joy rider. My husband and I were looking for something cheap to do this weekend and decided to rent bikes. I read the reviews first, so I'm just going to cut to the chase and put info that I wish I knew:1. My biggest concern: You can put your bag in the holder and it is completely snug. I recommend ladies totes and small messengers for the best fit. You need to make sure it is at least a big hand width and a big hand wide or it too small. Likewise if your height of bag is larger than a men's 10 shoe size, you need to squish like crazy. 2. We just needed a 24 hour rental pass to get the bikes out. We went to a station that had many bikes there and it took us 3 new codes and about 20 minutes because we couldn't get ANY of the bikes out!! Called customer service which was about a 15 minute wait. It is really obviously they are tweaking the bugs out. On the other hand, people with an annual drove by, picked the bikes up, and zoomed out of there.3. These bikes are HEAVY. THEY SUCK AT HILLS. Also they seem really dangerous for street riding. Have you ever noticed that hardcore bikers in the city have really thin, lightweight bikes? This is for a reason. These bikes are the exact opposite. 4. We docked our bike and were able to take the same ones out 1 minute later we just previously docked. Yay? If you are debating on trading in your bike for these set of wheels: don't. Having 30-45 minutes to put your bike back and retake your bike is annoying. For pleasure rides, try it. It's a cool experiment. For a lifestyle, there's a lot to work out."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/25/2013,"I am a Citibike fan, for sure. Been using the service now for two weeks and as a way to commute it rocks. They still have a few things to get right. The App is not accurate as far as telling you what bikes are available on which docks. Also I witnessed employees taking bikes away from Mid-town in the morning which is very logical and works. However I think that they should be faster at this service I arrived in Mid-town this morning at 8 AM and the dock was already full. The concept is great and I am sure will take off, they do need to get some of the details right they will lose don't forget this is New York and we demand the best.Updated thoughts. It is great. The app is better and the traffic is getting more used to bikes. They are said to be rolling out a lot more bikes which will be good. Still have the issue of Mid town scarcity at 6 PM. Very much enjoying the service."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/30/2016,"This company is a prime example of a victim of its own success. Amazing idea but horrible execution. Had an awful experience when my girl friends and I rented bikes for the day--would never recommend. First of all, the 30-min bike exchange rule is written in tiny print and extremely easy to miss. Not only that, but the rule is very inconvenient and makes it difficult to have an enjoyable ride. Moreover, biking to any place that does not have many citi bike stops is impossible without being charged a fortune extra for surpassing the allotted 30 minutes. More than that, Citi bike technology is very buggy. It happened twice that when we went to get a bike, the kiosk said that there were no bikes left when there were many checked in. Also, it happened twice that we tried to put bikes back in, and the machine would not register that the bike had been replaced, hence not allowing us to take out another bike and putting us at risk for overcharging based on the 30 minute rule. The telephone service desk was rude and not very helpful, and did not offer great solutions to our problems. They also put us on hold for long periods of time (most likely due to the fact that many people were calling complaining about similar glitches...). Again, I think the idea of Citi bike is amazing, but this company has done an exceptionally poor job implementing and running their bikes all over the world, but especially in NYC. Such a disappointment and an overall downer on an otherwise good day."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/28/2016,Citibike is a total scam. They will charge your credit card for things you shouldn't be responsible for like having to ride around in circles for half an hour looking for an empty dock because the app doesn't work properly then they refuse to refund the overcharge. You won't get anywhere calling or opening a bank dispute. I will not be renewing because of this. It's a shame because it's very handy. I miss the days when the customer was always right. Now it's the customer is always wrong...
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/26/2015,"Woohoo !  More stations have opened. I can not say enough positives about Citi Bike.  I LOVE IT !  If you live in the city and you are physically able to ride you owe it to yourself to join. Just be careful riding (more protected lanes DeBlassio ! It's the only issue I'll be voting on come next election).  And please ignore all the reviews (which you will see are mostly from visitors) that can't figure out its a means of transportation not a bike rental store for tourists.  Hence, you must return the bike to a station in less than 30 minutes (45 minutes for annual members).  Which is plenty of time. And if you are going a long distance just dock your bike and wait 30 seconds for it to register and take out another bike.  Rinse and repeat."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/08/2015,"Once again not a city bike to be found in the East Village and its only 2:30 in the afternoon. This happens every day. no bike for you need a bike, no spaces when you have a bike to park"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,02/06/2015,"Pros:- Solid bike - I've never had a problem with the bike itself.- Security - I had my personal bike stolen in NYC and I'm sure a replacement would get stolen too. For the price of an annual membership, you could buy 1/2 of a bad bike and it would be stolen in 1 year. - Safety - these things don't go too fast and have bright lights. I think they publish stats that say nobody has ever died on a Citi Bike, probably due to the low speeds, lights, maybe bike lanes too.- Geography - these are great if you live below 60th St. in Manhattan or around BK Heights to West Williamsburg. Not great if you live elsewhere. See Cons.- Price - for the $100-$150 you couldn't buy a bike (and if you did it would be unsafe and probably quickly stolen.). For the price you could hardly even get annual maintenance to a bike.- Support - they pick up the phone when you call and solve your issue. There have been times that the station has not registered that I've returned the bike, but phone support locates the bike and fixes the problem without making you feel like you stole the bike.- Data - they open source the data so anyone can use it for 3rd party apps, analysis, etc...Cons:- Geography - you can't get far on these bikes because the station footprint is limited. Also, they charge you if you keep a bike for more than 45 minutes.- Danger! - the streets of NYC are a dangerous place! The police give you tickets! Deliverymen ride the wrong way in bike lanes! Everyone parks in bike lanes! Stay safe!- Don't ride too long - you won't find a station to return the bike and you'll get charged- Learning the System/Available parking - if you try and return it to a more residential area late at night, it's tough to find parking. Riding around looking for parking sucks."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/05/2013,"I was so excited to see upon returning to work in NYC that the CitiBike service was available.  I quickly signed up for a yearly pass so I could avoid the least favorite part of my long commute - the subway.  Seeing that I had three stations near me, I thought I should be in good shape for getting a bike anytime that I needed one.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case and seeing that I work at a college and it is summer, it will only get worse when the students return. In addition to getting a bike, returning bikes at Penn Station has been a nightmare.  At 5PM rush time, everyone is returning bikes to Penn Station.  I have missed my train several times due to having to hunt or wait for an open station to dock my bike.  When I wrote Citibike, they didn't seem to care one way or the other.I have also had trouble docking bikes.  Getting the bike locked into place is more difficult than it should be.  In the time I have had my account, it is rare that I do not have some sort of problem with a station.  I really wanted this to work out but it looks like I will be buying a folding bike so I can have reliable transportation back and forth to work.  Citibike is a great idea but the execution is poor - hence the 2 star rating.  I would not recommend using Citibike for transportation you have to count on.  For the occasional bike ride it is a good deal."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/10/2013,"Citi Bike's are a great way to see the sights or simply to get around.We rode the Citi Bikes from Chelsea to Tribeca and it was way better than walking or taking a subway. Watch where you're going and pay attention, and you'll have no problems with the Citi Bike."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/15/2013,"I was a fan from using it on a trip to Montreal, and got my annual membership key before it started.It is really helpful avoiding multi-transfer trips on the subway, and to reach places with few subway lines.  And given the limited numbers of Select Bus Service lines (what's up with that?), it is a great option.Love the station density, and hope they don't make DC's mistake of scattering stations too far from each other as it expands.And the system seems to be getting better at rebalancing and maintenance since the first few weeks.  My complaint is more about the quality of NYC's bike lanes, and the timing of traffic lights.  It seems on the protected bike lanes (called ""Green Lanes"" in some places), the lights don't allow for a rider to travel more than a few blocks before having to stop for a red light.  To encourage faster trips, time the lights so bikes can ride a lot of blocks.  It is A LOT easier for a driver to brake than for a cyclist to stop.  This is called the ""Green Wave"" in other cities."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/01/2014,"No need to add to the dozens of comments about non-functioning stations and not enough bikes and/or docks, but I will say this: Either the city needs to invest in the program, or Citibank needs to realize its reputation is going to suffer by having its name on a program that has so many flaws. Not everything can be entirely run by the private sector, especially something like this which is quickly becoming a major form of transportation meant to supplement subways, buses and taxis."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/15/2016,Very disappointed lately by Citibike. I bought a year pass and live in Brooklyn Heights. Lately the Clark St and Columbia Heights stations are empty almost every time I need to use them. The bikes are often in very bad shape. They really need to refill stations and do something now. The docks many times do not work. The new bikes are very nice if you can find them. But honestly it's become a service I pay for that no longer works in my neighborhood. I am going to request a refund.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/05/2014,"UPDATE:  Sad to have to edit my review a day later... but Citibike (a brilliant concept) needs to get knocked down to 1-star for now based on pure mismanagement.  Last night Citibike, obviously with the best of intentions, sent trucks around to replenish the racks.  The theme here is ""Too much of a good thing can turn south fast""!  & ""Learn to plan like a pro""Somehow, the idea of demand, traffic and logistical planning eluded all Citibike upper management.  I started at Stuytown for a quick jaunt to 2nd and Ave B to watch the MIA-SA NBA Finals with a friend.  Every rack was either overfilled, or the remaining spaces were broken.  Dozens of people were circling the East Village, Alphabet City, Lower East Side and Chinatown with no place to re-rack.  Are you kidding?  Calling in to Customer Service was useless.  A guy who identified himself as Gordon kept sending me to various locations that their software told them had multiple open spaces.  For some reason their field techs who TAPED OFF stalls for repair never relayed the information.  Way to work in a silo!  All their database info was inaccurate.  I RODE TO 9 STATIONS ONLY TO HAVE CUSTOMER SERVICE SUGGEST LOCATIONS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN WITH NO REMEDY THAN TO OFFER EXTRA TIME!!!!!  Want proof?  I shot video of multiple locations last night and will YOUTUBE IT!  The title will be: ""WTF CITIBIKE????""  There are many guest appearances by fellow disgruntled bikers.  Featured locations: 14th & B, 2nd & B, Stanton & Suffolk, Houston & Allen, 9th & C... there's more... OMG need I go on?I missed half of an epic NBA Finals and ended up all over town.   Many people were stuck with time OVERAGE CHARGES.  Mind you I overpaid for your service to begin with by purchasing multiple passes (Annual & Weekly at the same time)!  That's how much I believe in you.  Your customer service makes me long for Time Warner Cable Tech Support!!!!!!!!!!!Anyone worth their salt in NYC knows bike traffic on a Thursday summer night heads downtown to the village.  Overstocking village racks meant all the Citibike traffic coming in had nowhere to ""park"".  You call this logistics?  (Duh, Villagers take bikes mostly central or uptown for work, downtown after hours - this is NY!) Did you give any thought to making people ride all over the place like mad in the dark could cause injury?  One bad lawsuit due to this kind of poor planning and you will find out.My dear Citibike management, here are some analogies to help you realign your abysmal customer service:On the topic of overfilling racks: ""If a bar offers you a free pint of beer = good thing, right?  If they offer you 3 gallons of beer and say you have to drink it all yourself in the next 45 minutes or there will be trouble = bad, si?""On the topic of the user agreement: ""If your bank says you have to make a payment at one of their locations but they close their local branches, can they claim you refused to make a payment?  don't they owe you points of access?""Please Citibike, fix this situation and help me edit this back to 4-stars.  Your concept is brilliant.  Your constant business execution issues are ridiculous!  My original review:While I've penned massive reviews about Citibike in articles, I will spare the lengthy discussion and highlight 2 points:1) Reliability:  Citibike is great if you have the ""Annual Pass"".  Annual Members receive a digital key that reliably unlocks bikes.  24-Hour and Weekly Pass users must go to a kiosk and insert their credit card (that was used at time of purchase) to generate a 5-digit unlock code.  These codes are unreliable and quite frustrating.2) Date Nights/Uber Replacement/Get Creative: Use Citibike in place of a cab ride and tally up your savings.  You'll be amazed.  Use it for a ""date night"" and get out on the town.  Can you ride in a stretch mini-skirt?  Yes.  Had a writer put it to the test, pics and all and it worked!  Take a ride up to the park, grab a tan, then shoot to St Mark's for a wander in the East Village.  Of course, whatever you do please ride responsibly and... don't drink and ride!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/19/2014,"The bike concept is a great idea can't wait till we mature as a civilization to where this service is free. The problem I have with these bikes is the $100 dollar deposit that Citibank holds for 10 days that's madness it's crazy and and they don't even pay you interest on your money, that right there pissed me off I rented 3 bikes $300 locked up for 10 days crazy, but the kids and I did have a nice 30 minute $300 ride over the bridge priceless. Won't be renting those bikes again until they change the deposit policy."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/03/2015,"Be warned, if you get stuck with overtime fees, customer service will tell you all kinds of reasons you can't get your money back even if its their fault.  You have to dock the bike every half hour despite the ""24 hour"" daily pass, which is poorly explained on the kiosk.  The signs are confusing and some of the stations don't even work.  When i called up citibike about my experience they said they would issue a refund for the additional $67 they charged me for not docking in time as i was first time user.  i was thrilled until they sent me a $40 refund.  Didnt even have the courtesy to let me know it was going to be a partial refund.  I would have liked to use again, but now i just have a bad taste in my mouth and a deposit of $200 thats still sitting on my card 5 days later."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/19/2014,"Ridiculously awful.  Here was my experience in order as best as I can remember it.  Please keep in mind that I've used Capital Bike Share in DC which is a similar service with ZERO problems.1.  Attempt to rent a bike at first station.  Machine tells me that the ""transaction failed, please try again later"" twice.  I decide to walk to another citi bike station 3-4 blocks away.2.  Successfully rent bike, but about one minute into riding it it starts screeching.  Terribly.  Little children are holding their ears around me, but I need to get to the next station.3.  Arrive at next station, all slots are full, despite the app saying it had 7 free spots.  Attempt to press ""Request time credit"", but the touch screen is broken.  I'm now out another $4.  Walk to next station about 2-3 blocks away.4.  Successfully get a bike at next stop and ride it uneventfully to my next stop.  This was the only leg of my trip that worked well.5.  Check in bike.  Attempt to check out one of the bikes.  The touch screen works, but using the code won't release the (last) bike on the rack.  I decide to just keep biking to the next stop since I had another 5 minutes or so remaining.6.  Ride to next station and check in bike.  Attempt to checkout, but the touch screen is broken.  7. Walk 4 blocks to next station that shows 5 available bikes.  Zero are there.  Walk 3 blocks to next station.8.  Check out a new bike.  Ride about one block and realize the rear brake when used makes a noise so loud that it sounds like the rear tire is going to rip off.  People around me are staring and wondering what the hell is going on.  I return the bike and swap it for a second one, which fortunately works and I head to my last stop.Here's the count for you:Fully functioning stations:  2/8Broken bikes:  2Most stressful cycling day of my life."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,06/15/2013,"Received my key June 14th. Rode four trips just in my first day!Quite a few of the docking stations aren't working, and the lights seem to go red, yellow, or green at random. Slightly nerve-wracking not to be certain that it has acknowledged that the bike has been returned, but other than that it worked well in Tribeca, West Village, and Chelsea neighborhoods."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/18/2014,"I was beyond thrilled to see these bikes available when I visited New York City. We promptly began the process of renting them and envisioned a day free of subways and taxis. From the word go we started to have problems. We rented two bikes with one credit card and every single time it gave us two codes one of the codes would not work, and we would have to wait 2 to 3 minutes for that code to expire and request another code from the machine, but meanwhile the other bike had been free for five minutes and so now we only had 25 minutes to get to the next Dock station. It was very frustrating. Mind you, we had to go through this process six times, because we had to get new bikes six times in order to get around Manhattan throughout the day. Why? Because of this ridiculously short time limit of 30 minutes. At one point, we were trying to race between cars and constantly check our phone's map to find the next docking station, panicking that we would be late, and we got stuck at a red light. I crossed illegally because I didn't want to be charged extra, and I still was two minutes late and we both got charged four dollars. Completely unreasonable. There is no way that you should only have 30 minutes to navigate the city with traffic and find a new docking station. To get from the World Trade Center to Central Park we almost had to rent a bike three separate times! We ended up walking the rest of the way. But let's get to the best part... When we went to dock the bike, if there were free places to dock it, half of the docking stations did not work. They simply would not lock the bike in and you had to keep looking for a new one. And, if you want to be on your way quickly with a new bike, you can forget about that. You have to wait 2 to 5 minutes to even go through the process to get another ticket to get another code to get another bike, when you just had to return a bike that you weren't finished using because of the time limit. Brilliant.The bikes are bulky and awkward to ride, and it is very hard to figure out where the next docking station is if you are not familiar with the area. Half the bikes are out of service. Or they just won't unlock for some unknown reason and you have to move on to the next one. By the end of the night, we were so sick of these bikes. We spent most of our time in Manhattan obsessing over where to return a bike or how we would plan our day so that we could get it back in time. We wish we would've just taken the subway. I haven't even dealt with customer service, so I can't comment on that. But I am calling to try and get our eight dollars back, and we are apprehensive about the $101 hold they put on the card for each bike. I've been told that sometimes it stays on there for weeks. Hopefully there is no trouble with that. What a great idea that is crippled with poor execution."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/02/2013,Love it!  I use it to get around from Mid-town east to my office at Penn Station and to Hell's Kitchen.  This is so much faster than walking or taking the subway for short trips (especially cross town).  Plus it saves a ton of money.  First you have to get a yearly pass.  That's it.  Don't mess with the kiosk.I have had nothing but great success with the Citibike.  Every once and a while I may have to walk a few extra blocks to find a bike but that's going to happen during rush hours.  If a station is dead there is usually a working one close.  I don't understand all the negative complaints as I have had no really bad experience and I have ridden it every day for the last month.  with about 40 trips under my belt.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/11/2014,"First off: If you have had any issues with Citibike, please file a complaint with BBB, or call 311.bbb.orgThey are one of the most dishonest service I have used.  I signed up for as an annual member for one year, what a mistake :)If you are a tourist, rent a bike at a bike shop instead.  It's cheaper, more reliable, and you won't go back home finding out they put extra charges on your card.Disadvantages:1) They are dishonest and will charge you wrongfully if the system doesn't recognize you returned the bike. They will not refund your money.2) At times it can be hard to find an available bike/station to return bikes within walking distance.3) Risky to use the service if you are in a hurry.4) you can't trust the App when it tell you there are stations to rerun the bike or bike available for pickup5) Bike are starting to get rundown and at times the only free bike you find has an issue, which is why it's still there.6) It's too expensive for what you get.Advantages:1) If it didn't have to above issues, it would be a fantastic way to get around town weather permitting.Issues I have had:1) No bike at stations within walking distance.2) No station to return bikes within walking distance.3) Faulty App almost always tells you there are bike available when they are none.  Or there are a few but have a red light indicating they can't be taken out.4) Faulty App often tells you there are stations to return bike, but either there aren't any or they are not working.Note: I even check app after a few minutes of standing there and called there customer service and their system also showed bike/stations available.  But there weren't any.5) On many occasions I would return a bike and when I went to take a new bike out, the light would turn red an it wouldn't release a bike.  I would have to call the customer service and at times it would give up after 20min of waiting.  But they always fixed the problem right away if you waited enough time.6) To my dismay they were charging my credit card every now and then. $2 here $9 there and the amounts being so small I didn't notice them at first.  But when I called them they refused to refund me.  Saying it was my responsibility to properly lock the bike and that it's on the policy I signed up when I took the bike.  But I always made sure I got a green light after returning the bike and if I didn't I would always call them and wait till they pickup the phone and released the bike.It's worth saying again.  If you have issues with them, please file a complaint with BBB, or call 311.  bbb.comWe can't let bad businesses like this to thrive while much better, more honest business go out of service.  I love the fact that more people are biking around the city, but I hate to see them getting ripped off by dishonest people.  We deserver better than this and let's let the world know."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/15/2016,"Love it. Perfect Enjoyed my first Citibike experience. Picked up a bike for the unlimited 30-minute rides for one day at 106th CPW. Docked it at 102nd CPW to renew another 30 minutes when I spent time talking to friends instead of starting to ride. At 59th St end of the park, I walked the bike to Dock and unload again at 61st and Broadway, just 1 block from CPW at that end of the park. Headed back north for to finish the CPWbike path. Then docked the bike for the final time at 102nd. You need to wait 2 minutes before you can take / undock the bike by placing your credit card back in the machine for a new code. That was fine for me because I welcomed the break. I will probably take an annual membership instead of buying a bike because of ease of use and not having to worry about where I lock my own bike during stops such as showing apartments in my job as a real estate agent or stopping at a restaurant. All worked great! Love it. Perfect."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/20/2014,"I love the CitiBike concept, but after some horrible word-of-mouth and my own bad customer service experience today, I won't be using their service.I live in NYC and have been thinking about getting the annual membership for a while. I finally decided I'd take the plunge today, only to find out that if I buy the membership today, I won't be able to use it for over a week until a key comes in the mail. I called customer service asking if I could get a temporary code in the meantime, and I was told no, I could not. They offered me no workaround, and that was after waiting on hold for 10 minutes.To me, if a business can't even get the payment options right, there are probably going to be a lot of other problems down the road as well. It seems obvious that people want instant gratification--that when they buy something, they'll want to start using it right away. This is especially frustrating, as there is a very simple solution. Why not just offer new annual members a temporary code, much like the codes people who buy the 7-day pass use?CitiBike, get your act together."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/11/2014,"Never again. I called Citi Bike and they told me my deposit was released from 2 weeks ago....when I called to check on it for the second time, they told me to speak to my bank to release it. I called my bank and they said they have no record of Citi Bike holding the money so basically my $110 is floating in space until further notice"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/12/2015,"I purchased 4 week-long passes when visiting NYC.  I had no problems with it the first day, but on the second, the system claimed we didn't properly dock one of the bikes and rescinded use of one of our passes.  We had followed all instructions for docking but the customer service representatives could offer us no recourse until they ""recovered"" the bike which underhandedly shifts liability to the customer.When I finally spoke to a supervisor, she promised a full refund which I did not receive.  When I contacted customer service four days later, I received no response.  It has been seven days since I last contacted Citi Bike's customer service and still no response.I have used bike rental systems in multiple cities and they all have similar flaws but I have never encountered such uninterested customer service."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/19/2014,"The concept of Citibike is better than what you actually get. The bikes are crappy and the computer system doesn't always work. One time, I went to FOUR different docking stations only to find out that every one was broken. I spent more time on the phone with customer service than on a bike.Unless you're a tourist, just buy a bike."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/31/2016,"i have no idea how this awful system stays in operation - the bikes are either completely gone or the stations where you go to return them are full - which means you have to drive around and around and around to other stations hoping to find a place to dock it - or get charged a hefty fee.i don't understand why they don't have trucks relocating the bikes around town - oh, they say they do, but the only place I ever see them at is near penn station - and why?  Penn Station has numerous transportaton options.   The east village is the worst!!  Bikes are gone by 8:45 am and empty all day until 6 pm - and then the rack are 100%full with the returning white kids from their fancy jobs.  What this means is noone can use a bike during the day or at night - since if you take a bike out, chances are when you return there will be no open docks.  Why isn't this problem fixed?"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/20/2016,"Rip off!!!!! OK, I admit that I didn't read the fine print, but charging people an overtime charge for not docking your bike every 30 minutes is just wrong.

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/02/2016,"Scammers.... Honestly rented a citibike for like 20 minutes, returned it and they charged me about 100 dollars.  Customer service was service was non-existant and the people wouldn't transfer me to someone in charge.  All they would day is that someone would cal in 3 business days.  It's been a week and still no call.  Writing it off as experience to never use CitiBike again."

NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/01/2013,"Having used similar systems in other cities, we found the largest disadvantage was the 30-minute limit! We were staying in tribeca and wanted to ride across the Brooklyn bridge - which would have had us stopping twice. However, due to the fact there are stoplights, excessive pedestrian traffic, etc, there's no way we would have made our 2nd 30-minute stop....and we didn't.Also, the fact you need a new code each time you check in, even if you purchased a 24-hour pass, is definitely an inconvenience. We were next to a few European travelers, and they were incredibly confused:( GREAT CONCEPT - so glad it's in the city and is available, just has a few kinks to work out!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/31/2016,A great way to stay fit. Some of the bikes are less than great but when you think of the wear and tear it's expected. And the cost is fantastic if you do an annual. Learning and sharing secrets with other Citi bikers is helpful: the bikes with plastic wheel covers and Mets stickers are newer and lighter. Some of the old bikes are like riding tanks. Super heavy.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/20/2014,"I am generally very patient but I am FURIOUS with my citi bike experience.

Now I am emailing them they are not even replying, what kind of service is that?!Complete disappointment !"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/12/2016,"The concept is great, but it is a terrible design and a complete rip off!!  In order not to be charged constantly for your time, you have to check in at a bike station every 30 minutes!  You spend your entire time looking for the next bike station rather than enjoying your ride and the sites.  We missed most of the sites in Central Park because we had to find the next bike station to check in so we would not be charged for every additional 15 minutes!!  And when the check in place is full, as the one we rode to near Central Park, you have to find another check in point!!  Plus you can never let your bike out of your site because thee are no locks with them.  There are lots of places to rent bikes for the day and they come with bike locks so DO NOT CHOOSE CITI BIKE!!"

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/03/2015,"Bike sharing in a city--what a great idea. In reality, what a kafkaesque nightmare. I'd heard that the new CEO, Jay Walder, had resolved many of the issues I'd heard people complain about, and was going to improve the service. What a failure. I used the service twice. As it stands right now I've paid $350 for two 40 minute bike rides. Wow, not even Uber peak pricing is that awful.I returned my last bike to a dock on a friday. Monday morning I received an email stating my account had been charged $1200 for a lost/stolen bike (accept the actual amount was over $1300). I call the rep who informs me that since I didn't notify them the bike was lost/stolen they made the charge. They claim they tried to call me (but no email).  OK well let's reverse it because the bike was returned I request. They claim they didn't have it in the system. Then I talk to the supervisor. I ask how to resolve this since it's the first I'm hearing of it. She explains I needed to call within 24 hours of loosing the bike. Well, I put the bike back into a dock, why would I call when the bike wasn't lost or stolen. She informs me there's nothing she can do. I ask if I should call the police and make a report to see who stole the bike and see if security tapes can be obtained.  She asks me what the error code was that I saw when I returned the bike 3 days ago. Um, I didn't realize I needed to look. Well, she can see that there was an error when I tried to return it. Great I think, so the bike is in the system. No she says there was an error, therefor the bike wasn't returned and the she informs me I may do whatever I like and hangs up. I call back, this time I get another person, somewhat more helpful. She looks into again and can't find the bike in the system but she can see that the dock was not used again. Maybe the bike the bike is still there. Can I go check and call them back. Yes, I can.I go to the bike rack and lo and behold the bike is there exactly where it was 3 days ago. Still locked in the dock. I call the rep. She asks me to push the bike in hard. I do. She says did you just put it in. No the bike has been here since the first 'error reading' on friday, less than an hour after I took it out. She says well, sometimes when you return the bikes if you push them in too hard it causes the error. But that's exactly what she asked me to do. Anyway, she says the bike is in the system, sorry for the inconvenience you will not be charged.I get home, and there's an email saying it will be 3-5 days before they release the $1300 but in the meantime they are charging $171 in additional late fees. WTF.I email. I call back. Finally, later in the evening I get a truly polite and professional individual. They take the time to look into the matter and again, check with a supervisor. And again, I'm told they will reverse all the charges. Great. I go to bed thinking the matter resolved. Today, I get another email stating they will be charging late fees and there's nothing they can do. I need to speak with another supervisor. So nearly $1500 of fees they may or may not return in the next 3-5 business days for a bike that was returned in less than an hour. The was the most expensive bike rental ever. Never again. I've learned my lesson. Tell your friends, tell your family but don't tell your enemies. Tell them to use citibike...it's the best revenge."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/02/2016,Citibike has a rule that even if you rent the bike for a day you have to dock the bike every 30 minutes! This turns out to be very difficult especially for tourists who usually aren't even aware of the rule. They are back in their own country before they see a huge extra fee for not searching for a docking station every 30 minutes. It happened to my friends. Why such inflexibility? I guess citibike make a lot of money that way. Welcome to New York!
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/16/2014,Never ever ride more than 30 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ridiculous High Payment for Overtime cost me 77 dollars.  if you exceed 50 seconds after 90 overtime you will pay 12 dollars for that just 50 seconds.

When I called customer service they say according to their system the bike was used for over a day. The bike was properly docked! but I suppose their systems don't work. What a shitty service!

NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,12/15/2014,"Spent weekend in NYC and loved the idea of exploring on the bikes. Girlfriend and I bought 2 day passes. The weather was cold so I think the idea of renting bikes wasn't overly popular so there was never an issue with available bikes. Bikes seemed to be generally in good working order. The problem came with the aspect of getting codes and unlocking the bikes. We routinely could not get one or both codes to work which then required waiting 2 minutes and then retrying. We also encountered a broken kiosk screen after locking up bikes which prevented unlocking a new set of bikes, requiring us to walk to the nearest station. After couple hours we were totally aggravated by the system failures and Citi Bike refunded our money. We have rented bikes in DC and always had great experiences with Capital Bikeshare. Hopefully the Citi Bike system problems can be worked out and the system will improve. The customer service dept was always prompt to answer and courteous but they didn't have the ability to issue codes over the phone when kiosk generated codes failed or kiosks were broken so their support is limited. Bottom line, it's a fun way to tour NY and the price is right but the system isn't reliable at this time."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,10/17/2014,"UPDATE: After purchasing the annual membership, my experience improved greatly (for daily and weekly, look at my original review below). I have it a three because some weeks it's a 5 - no issues, jump on and go, life is good. Other weeks it's the same old story, no bikes a) are there, b) unlock, or c) are in working condition. Overall, it needs some serious investment, but when it works (45-65% of the time), it's great. ___________________________________From my short 4-day research, it seems specially designed only to work for true NYers (meaning those with an annual membership). So I signed up for annual membership, but while waiting for my key to arrive (any day now?) I did the weekly pass. Then my daily nightmare began. In my journey from Grand Central to 10th Ave (which should take 10-15 minute ride) it inevitably takes more like 25: 10-15 min of actual riding after 10 minutes of attempting to unlock the bike on either side by putting the code in, seeing red, trying it 3 more bikes, getting a new code after waiting the requisite 2 minutes, trying the next code and repeat until it eventually works. Or I give up and walk to the next station - eating up more time. Why is this better than a taxi again? I guess it depends on how much your time is worth. It's not that I don't like the concept or want the program to succeed - I absolutely rely on it to get to an area the subway doesn't go, but in the first week I've had some issue every day. Sometimes both ways, but mostly GCT. It seems like those with an annual membership don't have any problems, so I'm hoping when the key arrives I can come back and add a few stars (unfailing optimism or delusion?) Until then - I hate it. It's one of the outer levels of hell. With a blue bike."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,09/17/2014,Where is the love for Queens? I have a year membership but I'm unable to get home and have to take the subway. Why are you trying to impede my fitness goals Citi?

Even with flaws (occasional empty docks, cracked wet ""saddles"") this is the best thing to happen to New York City in a long time.  It's given me a new perspective of the city and helped get me get in to better shape.  I never have to worry about bike repairs, theft, and there are lots of docks where I usually like to go.  I've heard it's growing and all I can say is keep going.  Also, work with the city on more and better bike trails...  Otherwise 5 Stars!!  Update: WOW Citibikes keeps getting better. I never thought I'd ride a bike around this crazy city. Citibikes!! please keep growing and improving!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/22/2014,"Watch Your Wallet - These Guys are Sharks!Make sure to check your credit card statement DAILY. Day one went pretty well with only a few stations that had problems offering up bikes against provided codes. But day two in lower Manhattan (Wall Str) was an ABSOLUTE DISASTER!First - it took 3-4 codes at each station to get a bike - which cut into riding time as there were three of us. Then we ended up at two stations that would not give up bikes regardless of the number of codes generated.Customer service advised us at the first station that would not provide a working code, that it was probably low batteries at that station and to walk to the next closest station (which was a pretty good distance away and in the wrong direction). After getting there - that station would also not give up a working code. Customer service was customer NO service and was not helpful.Woke up this morning to find my debit card charged for $303.00 rather than the $9.95 contracted. Obviously due to the stations not registering the bikes.Now I am in a dispute with them and my bank that will take WEEKS to repair.While I applaud the city of New York to be so forward thinking and evironmentally conscious by deploying this bike system, the company mis-managing this i program is an absolute disaster. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE AT RISK OF GETTING STRANDED without a bike. And then charges on your card resulting due to a break down in their system"

NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/24/2013,"I LOVE Citibike! I had soooo much fun Citibiking all over the city for 2 days this weekend. We rode for about 6 hours the first day and then about 4 hours the next. We took our Citibikes from the East Village over to the West Village, then over to the West Side Highway. We rode all the way up to about 46th Street and then took them back down to Battery Park. The bike lane on the west side is really so nice and it was so much fun because you can go fast without worrying about any cars or having to stop.  I have to say, I was super hesitant about this whole concept at first and was definitely nervous to take the bike out onto busy avenues with lots of cars and no bike lane. But after a days worth of riding, you get used to it and become more daring, the same way you would walk as a pedestrian. The bikes themselves are great.  If you put a bag in the front, it makes your bike feel top heavy and weird, so I would advise riding with as little things as possible. We figured out a way to strap in our bottles of water in the front. The bike has these two elastic bands that you can strap in your stuff to the front. Oh and if you feel like your bike may be broken, (which happened to me with the first one I took out), all you have to do is lock the bike back in and wait 2 minutes to get another code in order to take out another bike. You also should press the repair button on the dock where you locked in the broken bike. One thing that really was annoying and kind of unacceptable considering this is brand new and it's Citibank - is that the touch screens and machines at many of the stations are not working properly. Several times my code wouldn't work and I would have to wait another 2 minutes in order to request a new code. Several times the machines were broken, where it didn't allow you to request a new code with your credit card. I had a 24 hour pass, so I unfortunately had to keep inserting my credit card into the machines in order to get a new code to unlock the bike. If you have an annual pass, all you do is use your key to unlock a bike at the actual dock where the bike is and you don't have to deal with the codes. Oh and sometimes the app will show you that a station has a certain amount of bikes available, but when you get there, all of them are broken. So you have to then find the next station and hope there are available bikes. I learned that if the app is showing there are any less than 5 bikes available, that your chances of finding a bike you actually can take out is low.  However, I do see the van going around the city re-distributing the bikes so hopefully they are working out these quirks. I loved it so much that I ordered the annual key and will be anxiously waiting for it in the mail!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/28/2013,"As a motorist it boggles my mind that nobody foresaw the fact that there are now legions of non-helmeted amateur bikers zipping and swerving through New York traffic.

NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/28/2013,"2014: Upgrading them to 2 stars. I do use the bikes regularly.The idea might be beautiful but their whole system is completely flawed to the point where it beats the original purpose: convenience. It seems citibike has really striven to become less convenient than the existing transit systems such as subways and buses.Why? As everyone who's tried the bike share for a few days knows:* You can be waiting over 2 weeks EASILY before receiving keys for an annual membership. You think you can stop paying the unlimited metro card but then end up spending way more to cover all the weeks these jerks take to mail freaking keys.* The machines are CRAP. The software is slow and glitchy as hell, like 4-graders made it. The card readers are specially prone to malfunctioning -making the system specially sucky for people with temporary passes. NO RELIABILITY. I'd say more than half the times I've tried to use one they either weren't there or didn't work at all - not even showing an error message. CRAP (Like every Citi bank system, BTW)* 0 RELIABILITY, something will go wrong 50% or more of the time. The system will be down, the machine will be off, the reader is bad, the bike is broken and you can't tell until you get it (and then need to wait 2 minutes to try again)... the list goes on and on. It's almost like the MTA's dream come true, a conspiracy to prove bike shares don't work. Bottom line YOU CAN'T RELY ON THIS CRAPPY SYSTEM because it sucks, like Citi bank (again, BTW)* Entire stations dissapear! WTF. There's no information, and the diagrams are comlpetely unreliable. Not even the website or app have accurate information. Stations are literally removed overnight with NO WANING. Its like they're TRYING to prank us.* There's a constant uneven distribution of bikes per station (some are full and don't accept more or their docks are simply malfunctioning, and some are completely empty).Bikeshares rock, CITIBIKE not so much..."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/08/2016,"Was not clear that even though you rented the bike for 24 hours, you need to re dock it every thirty minutes or you are charged additional fees.

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/01/2013,"waste me lots of time to try to get a bike. There are usually only 1 or 2 bikes left around the place I live. And 100% of the time I couldn't unlock these bikes.

I thought it was NY law that if on a bike - you must wear a helmet. I've seen tons of people riding these bikes in the street, going the wrong way, etc. I love the idea of a bike share program in NYC but this one has a lot of problems."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/07/2014,I only used Citi bikes for three days but I was incredibly impressed.  It's an amazing alternative to the dirtiest subway in the world as well as not being able to hail a cab.  I found the bikes in working order and the stations reliable.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/24/2013,"I'm a regular user and fan of the bike share system in Salt Lake City and I was excited to utililize the CitiBikes for exploring NYC over a weekend,  My wife and I purchased two 24hr passes and right from the outset there were problems.When you buy two passes at once you can receive two codes to retrieve two bikes.  On multiple occasions we could retrieve one bike but not a second.  You go from bike to bike and try a code each time.  The codes expire after five minutes so then you need to go back to the kiosk to get another code.  We called customer service and the only solution offered was to walk to another station to retry the process.  By the time you do that the time on the one bike you retrieved at the first station already has 15 minutes on it.  We tried the system again the next morning to see if things would be different the next day, but again had the same problems.After so many failed attempts at trying to retrieve bikes we felt it was taking up far too much vacation time to do the things we wanted using CitiBikes.  So we gave up and just walked or used MTA.  I called CitiBikes to request a refund but they wouldn't do it.  I plan to have VISA back me up on this one as we paid for a service that was not usable.Also be aware that there are no stations (zero) above 60th Street."

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/08/2015,Citibikes  NYC do not describe very well how much they charge you when you are using their bikes.  The charged me $51.00 for 2 1/2 hours.  I guess they are there for locals to go from bus to where they need to go. little quick 29 minute trips.  Plus they hold onto your $100. deposit for several days.  Not cool and I will not use this service again.   feeling overcharged citibikebank.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/03/2013,"I really wanted to like this concept, but it remains a disaster. I have a long commute to the far the east side and cutting down the 15 min walk to the train each way sounded like a good idea. Gave the program a few weeks to work out the kinks and decided to try it out today. I was really ready to be patient and understanding but in one word - AWFUL. First, ridiculous pricing structure is ridiculous and seems designed not to encourage people to try it. $10.80 for the only option (24 hour pass) for what would be two rides back and forth to the office..seriously?! Why no one ride? Anyway, I realize the yearly is the only way to go and was willing to shell just out to give it a try. Second, the kiosk was horrendous to use. The screens barely respond to touch, you have to basically punch it with your finger to respond. Then it plays 20 questions with you. For crissakes this is new york, I'm in a hurry. Let me pay and be on my way. Finally I get my code. I had read how to get the bikes out so I was prepared. Unfortunately after trying 5 different bikes, none would release. I called and asked for my money back. The only positive experience was the customer service rep was nice. Sorry but never again. You've lost me, Citibike."

NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,06/04/2013,"I'm a keen bike rider from Vancouver visiting New York--Manhattan, Lower East Side. I've been here many times and I ALWAYS get a bike as soon as I get to town. My last 3 visits I've zoomed all over the city, even in February, and I absolutely LOVE biking in New York, so I was super excited to see the Bixi bike idea here in NYC. It *is* a Canadian invention, after all. It's fine, for non-serious bike riders--like my mother or my wife. For someone who is a seasoned bike rider, though, it might fall short. I never went out of gear 3 the ""highest"" gear, i.e. the one for going the fastest--which is nearly the lowest gear on my ten speed at home. I suppose these bikes are good for grannies, but for a ""normal"" bike rider, it needs a few more gears. Bottom line: you cannot go fast on these bikes.My main criticism is that there is NO FEEDBACK about time. I checked the time when I released the bike (which takes a bit of a learning session to get it out, but OK once you learn it, it's a no-brainer). Then as I was riding I was constantly checking my smartphone to see what time it was. Then when I had about 10 minutes to spare I started to use the CitiBike iPhone app to find the nearest docking station. I found it, with minutes to spare, but was not precisely sure if I was over or if I made it under the 30 minute wire. How to tell? No idea. The bike gives no indication if you are going to be billed the $4 penalty, nor does the docking station. Do I have to wait until I get my VISA bill? That seems like an odd way to run a business. Can I go to some website to see what my charges are? There's no instructions or indication of overage charges.Nowadays, with digital technology so pervasive, how hard would it be to have a 30 minute count-down timer on the ""dashboard"" of the bike? There's plenty of room for it. This would ease ""riding anxiety"" for the renter--that's for sure. I wish the bikes had this, and there's no good reason why it's missing.To end on a positive note: the seat is amazingly comfortable. The bike is super easy to use and adjust for seat height. The gears are perfect for old people and novices. The handle grips are spongy and comfortable. The seating is upright and pleasant. The tires are huge and won't slip into the many NYC sewer grates and street cracks. Everything about this bike calls: ""Ride me! It's fun and easy and safe!"" So that is all good, and hopefully more people will ride bikes in New York.However, if you are an avid cyclist, just rent a bike at a proper bike shop, or book a hotel that has good bikes for free. Finally let me say it again: there is no better way to get around New York than on a bicycle. DO IT!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/28/2013,"Woe be to you if you think you can take the bike out for spin. I visited New York this past weekend and thought it would be fun to take a ride in Prospect Park.  I rented two bikes.  The first station wouldn't accept my card or my companion's.  There were two very frustrated riders desperately trying to unlock their bikes in the allotted five minute window, I don't know if they were able to get their bikes.  We walked over to the station on 4th and Dean and were able to get two bikes.  It was not clear to me that you needed to re-dock the bike within 30 minutes or incur a $13 dollar overtime fee.  Citi Bike says it's clear but, it isn't at all.  We had a lovely ride in the park, brought the bikes back and went on our way.  Imagine my surprise when three days later I was charged the outrageous fee and the deposit fee was still be held on my account.  What a racket is all I can say.  If you are from out of town, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this rip off.Well color me stupid.  I finally figured out the mechanics of citibike and totally misunderstood how it works. I take it al back."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/23/2013,"BEWARE prospective annual members of Cititbike.  The $95 annual membership fee (plus tax) is not truly a $95 fee IF you want to be able to use a bike immediately.  There is a 10 day wait period for a key to arrive in the mail.  So if you are planning to ride today, you will need to spend another $9.95 (plus tax), making the cost of your annual membership potentially as high as an additional $99.50 or if you opt for a week long pass at $25.95 then the additional cost is only $51.90 (plus tax of course).  So in essence, there is no such thing as a $95.00 annual membership. It is a 355 day membership or, if you wish to ride immediately, it is anywhere from a $114.95 (pus tax) membership to a $145.90 (plus tax) membership.  When I called Citibike incredulous that the $103 I had just ten minutes ago forked over on my credit card did not allow me immediate access to a bike, I was told ""that's what it says on the website,"" but nowhere on the annual membership sign up page does it say you will not have access to a bike for 10 days.  It says you will not receive a key for ten days, but nowhere does it state that you must pay additional monies in order to ride a bike before ten days.  If Citibike allows one day or week long riders to have immediate access to bikes, why not annual?? Would it have been that difficult to allow the annual member to buy a membership at the kiosk and ride off immediately or a code when registering online to allow access before the key arrives??  Or does Citbike hope that more annual members will opt to spend additional money than sit at home and fume like this one is?  I do not fume quietly.  Before writing this review, when I called Citibike I asked to speak with a manager. It became clear that I was not the first angry customer.  Great news! - Citibike is just starting and already does not care about its customers.Bottomline, it is poor business sense to infuriate what could be the core base of a business - unless, of course, Citibike's operating plan involves maximizing income over benefiting city residents.  Is it too much to hope that Citibike has better plan for how it will maintain the bikes?  If not, then New York residents may be in for a rude and rusty surprise.  This program could be great for New Yorkers and for the environment, but like much of what Mayor Bloomberg has done while in office, it is likely designed to make money off the middle class at the expense of bike shops."

NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,07/26/2013,"It's a great idea, but seems to suffer from overwhelming demand.The pros are obvious, so I'll focus on the cons:1. It's absolutely impossible to find a bike in residential areas in the morning or in commercial areas in the early evening. You might as well be looking for winged unicorns. 2. The software registers broken bikes as ""available"" because they are in the docks. This is very misleading and leads to a lot of frustrating wandering from station to station looking for a bike. 3. Software glitches leave entire stations out of service. No bikes can be checked out when this happens, regardless of how full the station might be."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/01/2013,"citibike should be ashamed at the completely incompetent roll out of this service. Let me say that the idea of it is amazing and when it works I am a huge fan of the service. However, they cut out the old software company and we are all suffering because of it. I constantly get trips where the return is not credited so not only can I not get another bike without calling and waiting to speak to someone, but my credit card gets charged for overages that dont exist (even though they tell me it wont). My girlfriend just joined and after 3 weeks they charged her card $206 in overages that didnt exist!The app is completely inaccurate as far as where there are bikes and docks available which makes it worse than worthless."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/27/2013,"I'm giving two stars because the concept is obviously great- I'm really rooting for this to succeed. They need to improve their logistics. We took bikes from the lower east side to Williamsburg, where there were many people waiting at each station to re-dock their bikes. We had to dock them two miles away from our ultimate destination. There need to be more convenient stations set up to accommodate demand. I hope they continue to refine this concept in NYC. I did not have trouble finding convenient stations with available spots when I frequently used the city bike rental system in Paris."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/04/2014,"It was really nice to have access to bikes without having to bring them along to the city. I would have liked a 1 hr ride option rather than having to dock the bike every 30 minutes and then get it right back out. Numerous of the dock stations were broken. Many of the bikes seats were cracked, but not a huge deal. Will certainly make use of them again."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/18/2014,"I don't get the complaints.  I am sure we are subsidizing the complainers.  A hundred bucks a year.  They need to raise this, if for no other reason to be sure that it continues.  Sure, once in a while there aren't any bikes.  Heaven forbid you have to walk a block to get another one.  Raise the annual, lower the daily and hourly, keep it going.  They need better security, because I hear about teens, especially, able to wrest a bike off the racks."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/18/2013,Citi Bike is the worst. The system is completely broken and should be ripped out of NYC. I had to wait to dock my bike because 2 stations were completely full in Tribeca. The purchase process is ridiculously slow and you have to use Mastercard to purchase? What a racket.  I'm sorry but it is totally inconvenient and to top it all off I got a ticket because I was riding the Citi bike on the sidewalk which caused me to get charged extra for the rental! Citi Bike was the worst experience I have had in NYC in a long time. This is a complete waste and I know this will eventually fail because of the poor design. What a waste. Get your own bike and ride.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/18/2013,"Completely, utterly, wildly awesome. Opens up the city in so many ways.Money for what would have been a 25 minute walk, which a subway could only shave a few minutes off due to wait time. Citibike turns that into a 10-12 minute trip for no marginal cost once you've purchased an annual membership. The whole city feels smaller having the ability to make such great time between neighborhoods.Saves lots of scratch on subway tickets and is good exercise to boot. Best thing ever."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/25/2013,"It probably works better for annual members. I used it for 5 days last week with a week pass and found I wasted more time running from station to station trying to get bikes. If you only have a pass you have to run your original purchase credit card at a station for an unlock code that lasts 5 minutes. One station had a busted screen so you couldn't use it for a code, several others had out of order credit card readers. The App is supposed to tell you how many bikes and how many docks are available at each station and it was never accurate. There were almost always 3 bikes out of commission at a station.First morning I tried to use it the first station screen was busted so I moved to another station. I was able to purchase the week pass and get a code but the 5 bikes docked were locked with a red light saying they needed maintenance. I then found one more station with functioning bikes, but the credit card reader was out of service. Very frustrating. I learned from a year membership person that he has some sort of fob that gives him access without all this, but that didn't help him much as he was trying to park his bike at a completely full station which according to the App had 10 docks available. Very disappointing overall.I sent an email to complain and received an email back within a day saying that my email was received and to please join their email list. Not likely. 5 days later, no other response."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/02/2013,"i wanted to love citibike but my experience was pretty meh. PROS:*docking stations are easy to find (EXCEPT there weren't any near SMORGASBURG in williamsburg so i had to walk quite a bit to get from the nearest docking station to the 'burg).*it is pretty dreamy to get on a bike, ride to your destination and then drop it off without having to worry about where to park itCONS:*the station just at the end of the williamsburg bridge (on the BK side) had TONS of broken bikes and i might even say all. so many so that i called the citibike phone number and after 10 minutes the representative finally found my account and advised me she didn't know why i was having trouble unlocking a bike. ANNOYING. i had people waiting for me and it really held up our day (add the ten minutes prior: trying to figure out what i was doing wrong and why i couldn't unlock a bike with my new code = 20 minutes late meeting friends).*the fact that you have to switch bikes after 30 minutes is annoying. they should have an option where you can rent for four hours or even eight hours. that way there's no stress and you're not setting your timer on your phone every few minutes.CITIBIKE: PLEASE MAKE IT BETTER! i can't tell you how many times i've passed a docking station and potential citibikers are hunched over, swearing at the kiosk because it won't accept their card or the touch screen isn't working."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/05/2013,"Loved this idea, especially because the MTA is getting worse and more expensive. There are tons of Citibike stations in my area and in most of the places I need to go, since I mainly move around below 40th street. They are awkward and heavy but get me around the short distances I need to go.Citibike maintenance needs to step up their game though. I have seen the same broken bike (broken chain) sitting on 32nd and Broadway today that I saw on Friday night! So that's 3 days later! Friday night there were no bikes available, so much that I ended up walking from 42nd street to 14th street because every station was empty or only had broken bikes docked. If you check the app it will tell you there are bikes there -but it seems like it was the broken bikes that it was indicating to me! The app definitely needs some work. I don't think it updates as quickly as you need it to in real time. This weekend I encountered a lot of other frustrated Citibikers as I had trouble re-docking because the docks were simply not taking the bikes, others had the same problem, and also complaining that the stations were full and they had to keep requesting time credits. Seems like the system doesn't work well for commuting...as much as it is good just for fun to take a quick ride around. Earlier today in Chinatown I ended up riding around with a group of 8 people who were all riding around trying to find stations to dock their bikes! Its a great idea! So its such a shame to not have it work as efficiently. NYC is a complicated city to accommodate with something like this, every station I had been at for the last 4 days had a gliche and/or angry people who were having problems with the bikes! From tons of broken bikes to having docks not take bikes or let go of them. On the plus side, I happened to check my account online and noticed that after returning a bike after a short ride, it did not register as ""returned"". I quickly called customer service, took about 10min to talk to someone, and I gave my key #, explained my story in detail about the particular ride and where I returned the bike, even though it didn't register the customer service person gladly fixed my account and took my word for it since I guess all the stations were glichy the whole weekend but at least she didn't try to blame me or charge me for it!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/17/2013,"So finally after months of curiosity about the whole Citibike craze, my boyfriend & I decided to try it.So went for the full days pass at $10.00 a bike. First of all you hv to be a rocket scientist to understand the instructions. We stood at the stand for 10 minutes trying to decipher the instructions. Finally after getting the bikes out with the code they gave us, we went on to enjoy our ride through Brooklyn & prospect park. But what we thought was a great ride for a great price turned out to be a complete scam. When my boyfriend got his bill, the charge was not $20.00 but $180.00 for both bikes, which was outrageous. So what is not completely clear when you go to get the bike, is that although it's $10.00 for the day, you have to check in every 30 minutes, re-dock your bike, put in the same code & get the bike back out, which is ridiculous since docking stations are not installed in every neighborhood in the city. So what are you suppose to do? Stop what you're doing to go search for a docking station? Come on man!So when my bf called to explain & fight the charge, the customer service person said the bikes are not for leisure but for commuting around the city. Are you kidding me? Even if you did only use them to commute around the city, with New York City traffic, it's nearly impossible to get anywhere in 30 minutes.These bikes have only been a way for the city & citibank to scam you out of your money. Money for the city in all the tickets they have wriiten since they've been installed, and money for citibank for keeping the instructions obscure which are sure to confuse to buyer & they end up paying more. Needless to say, we will not be using these bikes ever again but investing in our own.DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY!!!!!One thing to note is that the actual company that runs this is NYC Bike Share LLC. through Citibank."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/01/2013,"DO NOT USE CITIBIKE!!!!My boyfriend and I got the one day access pass but we were charged double the price as they claimed that we were over by 30 secs - 1 min for two of the trips. Upon returns of the bikes, there were no receipts provided to prove the duration or the return of the bikes; thus, they can say whatever they want! They simply made the decision and blocked my email address so that I cannot inquire further. This was the worst customer service I have ever gotten. Assuming timers were correct, for simply less than 4 minutes, a price of $20 was charged! And we were certain that we arrived at the bike stations with minutes to spare and if anything, those couple seconds overtimes were due to issues with the bike racks as some of them did not accept the return of the bikes properly. The UNREASONABLE charges and POOR customer service certainly ruined part of the trip! This definitely poorly reflects citibanks line of business. I will never rent a bike from them again!!!"
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,07/29/2013,"Ok, I have to give some stars for the system and bikes. They are in very good shape and easy to ride.This service is a must in all cities nowadays and operations should be flawless by now... it is not the case:- Their system does not print your code after your first ride. Not a big deal, but they could tell you that... be aware. Meh- App does not reflect availabilities in real time. So you show up somewhere you think there are enough bikes... and there is not enough. Meh Meh- Card reader did not work at several locations. So you go to a place, try to get bikes and can't because they cannot read your card... Meh Meh Meh!!! Very frustrating and waste of time, especially when you want to head back to your hotel to catch your flight... - Customer service: well, we had no idea that the card reader was faulty so we called customer service and asked for help. They had no idea of what was going on and after 2 or 3 minutes they told us verbatim that they had other customers on the line waiting and as we were not a yearly subscriber they had no time for us and hung up. That's it! I wonder why they have a customer service... useless, irritating, and very rude to say the least. So if you have plenty of time, ready to walk some blocks to find a bike, and ready not to call customer service in any circumstances, it's ok."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/22/2013,"Great Service... BUT, CitiBike's ability to service the current customer base is overshadowed by their greed to sign up members. They tout 90,00 members, yet only have approximately 6,000 Bikes; what are the odds of finding a bike using their crystal ball app?ZERO availability at Penn Station and surrounding areas during early morning commute.... and Zero Bikes avaialable in Midtown East in the reverse commute. ABSURD!Stop enrolling people and taking money for no service. Local politicians, as expected could care less... and turn a deaf ear to this issue. Perhaps the new Controller wanna be - Stringer (if he wins)  will investigate this take the money and run scheme."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/27/2014,"Bike in bad condition; terrible customer service. I picked up a bike at Central Park South. I immediately discovered that the seat did not tighten properly and turned left and right as a rode. Then, when I was halfway to Tudor City, the chain got stuck, broke, and fell off in the street. I had to walk the bike the rest of the way.When I called customer service, there was no apology, they just told me they would send someone to fix the bike. When I asked for some discount, they apologized. I repeated that I wanted a discount. The customer service rep checked and said sorry, not possible. Since when are customers expected to pay full price for a faulty product? The only good thing about my experience was that I only bought a 24 hour pass to try it out. Bike share is a great idea, but this is poor execution."

Along river/ gorgeous!!! ) parked bike in citibike rack at Staten island free ferry/ took round trip boat ride- saw Statue of Liberty/ then got new bike and rode up east side by river to 34 th then up first ave. Bike lane to 59 th- then parked and walked into park to see free concert. Thank you Citicorp! What a day!
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/14/2013,"Great for errands. Needs work as a commuting solution.Redistribution of bikes is the biggest problem for commuters. Finding a dock in daytime popular areas, like SoHo, is nearly impossible. Finding a bike near Penn Station before noon is very difficult.I still use my own skateboard/bicycle to commute. I use the Citibike for daytime errands only.It still beats a car, but like the car, you'll have problems finding a parking spot."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/16/2014,First two days- 3/5 stations that even had a bike didn't work. Worthless.
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/27/2013,The single greatest thing to happen to manhattan since bike lanes.
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,11/08/2013,Looks like they're doing a better job of relocating bikes during rush hours and fixing the bikes more readily! Good job guys!
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,01/14/2014,"I'm updating my review to 3 stars since some kinks which were there at launch have been worked out. When bikes and docks are available, this program is great. However you cant rely on Citibikes for your everyday commute because quite often bike stands are empty or refuse to release bikes."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/18/2013,"I really wanted to like this service.  But it was really frustrating. Touchscreens did not work at two stations.  When I finally got a touchscreen to work, neither of the two bikes at the station were open to riding. After 20 minutes of messing around with the system, I had my credit card entered, but no bike ride.  The iPhone app was unclear and unhelpful in identifying other stations to potentially use to ride.  Customer service did refund the charge, but I never got to ride a bike. As I say, I wish it had worked.  But for me it was an exercise in frustration.  Hopefully they can work out the kinks with the system because it is a really great idea"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/29/2015,"They regularly practice unethical business practices.  This effects how I feel about citi bank as a whole.  Their products malfunction, they charge you and then will not reverse the fees even after admitting it is there fault."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/21/2013,"I'm 5'2"" and the bikes seats just don't go low enough to allow me even to put one toe on the ground. Any thoughts on that?Also, I did notice that the stations were full. So where would you go to leave your bikes? You would, as someone mentioned, have to go back to where you came from. I love the concept, so I gave it 2 stars."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,11/20/2013,"This is a mixed review.  I got a day pass when in New York recently.  The price was right, $10 day, and I certainly got my money's worth.  The bikes are great, sturdy with three speeds that ride very nicely.  They are equipped with bells, automatic flashing lights and a nice place to put small packages on the handlebars.  The payment kiosks are pretty easy to use and there seem to be plenty of stations around the city.The problem comes with the limited 30 minute trip.  It became a real game to get where I wanted to go and return the bike to a kiosk in 30 minutes especially when the mobile app wasn't loading and it's hard to consult your phone when you're riding a bike!  I think an hour long trip would be much more reasonable especially with the day pass that it seems would be used more by tourists.  I hope they fix this glitch. Otherwise, kudos to NY for this new program!"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,06/21/2013,"Meah... my bf and I ride the bike shares in DC all the time and have not had ANY issues there, when citbike came to NYC I was so excited but frankly the software they use here is crap, you have to spend 10-15 minutes just paying for the thing and then the docks don't work most of the time. Hope they will bring the quality up to par with DC at some point."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/03/2014,What's the point of having a bike share if only 5% of your attempts to retrieve or dock a bike are successful?
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/19/2013,"I use citibike every day. I would recommend it to everyone who wants an alternative to the subway. It is inexpensive and reliable and has changed the way that I use the city. A lot of people complain about empty stations on occasion or bikes that are broken. This is true, but I you will also find headaches and problems on the subway, bus or in a car.  No system of transportation is perfect.I think this system works as well as other bike share programs that I have used (Montreal, Tel Aviv and D.C)."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/27/2015,"big scam.  $10 a day, but you have to lock it up at a station every hour or you will get charged!  what the heck?  too much to think about, just give me the bike and let me lock it up whenever and charge me whatever.  should be like $5 an hour flat rate or something.  all i wanted to do was bike from Penn to 14th street and it costs me $10 bucks?  how is that better than a taxi.  im all for biking and green etc, but if it costs more its stupid.  and he signs are misleading.  says first 30 minutes free. not so, thats after your first hour if you run over and dont lock it up within an hour then the first 30 after the first hour are free.  confused?  exactly!"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/09/2013,"I was a tourist wanting to see NYC and not just the subways. I decided to give Citi Bike a try, and I bought the week past. Altogether it was around $30. Everything worked out well for me, except for a few times when the machines would inexplicably not read my credit card (for the week pass you have to swipe or ""dip"" your card each time to get a new code for the bike). Well about twice the stations weren't reading my card and it wasn't just me and it wasn't just one station. The first time it was about six stations, so I called up Citi Bike and they couldn't do anything for me. The next time the exact same thing happened. I'm guessing there is a bug in the system, but who knows. There are a lot of bike stations across the city so finding a station isn't an issue. But if you want to do anything north of 60th St you are out of luck, as well as parts of Brooklyn. Once they expand and fix all the bugs it will be a good system. Right now it's just an ok system. Note: NYC drivers can be really aggressive, but I didn't really feel in danger at any time and I rode all the way from Williamsburg to the south side of Central Park. All the one way streets are confusing so your best bet is to get an app where there is a bike map so you can plan it."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/07/2013,"it showed so much progress but it seems that the software is a total FAIL !!! App is never accurate as to when bikes are available or docks available. Online account will let me log in but for more than two months now i cannot view my trips ??? What gives  as that is suppose to be whole beauty of the program??(its apparently ""a known it problem"" ... Ya think.. for two months ? Time for new IT people)Come on NYC, New Yorkers who want to get behind this program are rapidly losing patience.."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/08/2014,I would give less but don't ever rent a bike from them as they bang u with overtime charges so instead if being 9.95 day. How about more like 25.00 per day a bunch of BS  no wonder they still building banks in every corner.  SCAM
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/28/2014,this has been my main mode of transport for the past 6 months. everyday i commute across a bridge and don't have to worry about the bike.  i work early so i don't usually have an issue finding a bike or finding an open dock...about 95% of the time.    but i think if my work hours were different it wouldn't be as convenient.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/28/2014,"I live in Brooklyn but had to relocate to Manhattan for one week. A great time to try Citibike! Wrong. It took nearly 45 minutes just to buy the weekly pass. Two sets of German tourists had the issues and we walked to 4 different stations before we found a machine that would work properly. Unfortunately the codes they spit out to unlock the bikes did not work. The help desk was unhelpful and pretty much useless and you are on hold for an eternity. More than the yearly memberships, it is the daily and weekly rentals which will keep this enterprise afloat, but one year+ in and they don't have a clue on how to operate. When I finally got codes to work(usually the 3rd or 4th code works) most of the bikes were in terrible shape and docking stations wouldn't accept the bikes. Clearly the machinery is not handling the elements well. About as bad as trying to use a credit card on parking meter kiosk, none of them work. Too bad. they need to fire every top exec at Citibike, rip out the existing system and start over."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/25/2014,"DO NOT USE CITIBIKE. First time I used it and got a 1 Day Pass. I docked the bike every half hour and got a new bike each time with a new code from Columbus Circle to Brooklyn. I was charged $108! They said I never docked a bike I got from BK and their system did not show I docked/got a new bike every half hour! Crazy! I can't believe their system doesn't show that. Also, the machine in Brooklyn to get a new code did not work. I tried several times inserting my credit card each time and it wouldn't process. Their system does not show that either! Also, they should get cameras at each station to show the bike was docked. NOT COOL at all. If I had known i'd be charged  $108 - I wouldn't have docked it and got a new bike every 30 minutes. SO ANNOYING. They would not give my money back. I'm going to call them again. I went with my boyfriend who has an annual pass so hopefully this will help when they look up his history in the system versus mine. So ridic!!!!!! Citibike, go rip off a criminal not an innocent person."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/09/2013,"I love Citibike. I use it to commute from home in Brooklyn to my office in Downtown Brooklyn, or if I'm working in Manhattan, I bike to the subway instead of taking the bus. it means I get an extra 15 minutes of sleep in the morning. Occasionally all the slots are full at the bike rack I use by the courthouse in Brooklyn, but otherwise I haven't had a problem getting or returning a bike. I've biked in Manhattan a few times in Midtown, which was pretty hair raising. I don't know that I'll bike there too often. I love having a bike without having to worry about storage or security. As other people have pointed out, Citibikes are heavy, and they're not fast."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/08/2013,"I highly recommend trying out Citibike. I love owning my Bianchi bike, but I will absolutely continue to use Citibike when needed. On my 24-hour adventure, I loved the convenience of docking it and not worrying about where to park and lock my own bike. There was a momentary glitch when some other patrons and myself were unable to get the bikes out of the docks but customer service was easy to reach by phone and were extremely friendly and helpful (the way customer service should be). After about 5 minutes, the kiosk was back to working order. I biked over the Manhattan Bridge, the Brooklyn Bridge and rode along the Hudson River. I had a great and inspiring time. I've visited over ten bike shops over the past few weeks and each employee I spoke to fully supports Citibike and said it has not hurt business; it has helped business with cyclist buying helmets, biking bags and accessories. So there you go."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/23/2014,"Don't bother!  A wonderful idea ruined by poor planning.  They are supposed to have staff that ""re-balance"" the stations, but there are never any bikes available so what's the point?  One argument is that it's inexpensive, but I don't know anyone who wants to throw money away; even if it's only a dollar.  It is a rare occurrence when I can actually find a bike and the stations and bikes are in very poor repair.  The app does not update often enough and the telephone reps are nice by not at all knowledgable about the system they are there to service.  A waste of money and I will not renew.  I'm better off purchasing a foldable bike which I can bring to work."
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,02/14/2014,"Okay, let me provide an updated review of my Citibike experience. See the original post below for the entire history revolving around an improper overage charge of $108 during the snow storm, after half the bikes were off the road due to snow, and many of the docks were busted. They claimed I did not dock the bike correctly; I stated that I had called customer service to be sure, and had been told that I have no open trips. My credit card company contested the charge, Citibike claimed they had ""proof"" I failed to dock the bike, I raised a complete stink (again, see below), posted angry messages on their Facebook page with photos of the snow-covered docks, filed a complaint with the Department of Consumer Affairs, and requested mediation from the Small Claims Court division. After all that, Citibike called me three times today and left voice mail messages, the last of which stated that my refund would be processed. So yes, it all worked out in the end, but it was awfully time-consuming for me, and involved me unloading a ton of Mega Bitch on them, which was really unpleasant for me as I am not a hateful person set out to destroy Citibike. I just don't want them to rip me off. Despite this terrible experience, I would still recommend Citibike. It has its perils - very often the docks are either empty, or full, making it impossible to get a bike or return one. Their redistribution algorithm needs a lot of improvement. Even in good weather, docking's not so easy and requires brute force as well as finesse. The advantage is that the yearly  membership fee is really cheap. It will pay for itself in all the saved subway and bus fare. The bikes are sturdy, easy to ride, and easy to see even at night. Generally, except for my one terrible experience with the overage charge, customer service is good, you can always get through to the hotline. My biggest complaint is busted docks - those with electronic problems, as well as those that are just plain broken because they weren't built to withstand the ramming necessary to dock a bike. But overall, it's a convenient service for New Yorkers and I hope they expand it to upper Manhattan. ORIGINAL POST: Do not let these scammers have your credit card and especially not your debit card. You will rack up hundreds of dollars in ""overage"" even if you properly dock the bike, and Citibike will not refund these charges even when they know perfectly well that you docked correctly. You will have no choice to open a fraud investigation with your bank or credit card company. That is not to say that Citibike isn't convenient - it is. The question is, do you want to let a bunch of scammers steal hundreds of dollars in fees from you in return for that convenience?UPDATE: Citibike won their case against me in the fraud complaint division of my bank, so they scammed me out of $108, despite the fact that I called to ask if I had any open trips and they said No, no open trips. For all I know, someone at Citibike just pocketed this $108. Definitely do not let these scammers get a hold of your credit card."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/28/2015,"BEWARE!!! CitiBike is a huge ripoff!  The concept is great; however, the requirement that the bike needs to  be checked back in to a kiosk every 30 minutes makes the whole process inconvenient, and renting a bike pointless.  I purchased a 24-hour rental for a friend to ride around Dumbo, but actually used the bike for only 4 hours.  Long story short, they charged me an additional $93 dollars because I ""did not return the bike every 30 minutes.""  (Words of the customer service rep.)  What's the purpose of renting a bike for 24 hours if it needs to be returned every 30 minutes!!! I will stick to Bike and Roll or one of the other more reasonable bike rental services going forward.  Never again."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/13/2013,"Completely false and misleading advertising on price of rentals.  Heavy, slow bicycles.  Difficult kiosk system.  My boyfriend and I couldn't wait to return our bikes and continue exploring NYC on foot."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/13/2013,"The software they use is very glitchy.  I have an annual membership.  In order to take a bike, you first have to find an available bike at a dock (obvious), then you have to check if any of the lights on the dock are illuminated (if they are, you likely won't be able to unlock the bike), finally you have to insert your key into the slot in the dock and leave it there until the light turns green.  Once it's green, you lift the bike up by the seat to unlatch the lock, then you can lower it again and remove it from the dock for riding.  Don't forget to take your key back!  Pros:1.  Annual membership is not prohibitively expensive.  2.  The allotted 45 mins between docking is adequate and in line with the whole bike share premise.  3.  Bikes feel solid like tanks.4.  Better than walking.5.  Cool app.  I guess I'm one of the few people who actually like the official app.Cons:1.  30 minute limit for daily/weekly passes is kind of bs.  'Dock surfing' or 'daisy-chaining' will almost be a necessity, lest you're willing to pay the overage fees.2.  Bikes are heavy and don't track in a straight line particularly well.  3.  Sometimes entire dock stations are down.  4.  Sometimes, when you return a bike, their computer doesn't register the return.  It docks and locks fine, but if you check at the kiosk, or on your account online, there is no record of the return.  In these instances, I had to call customer service to get it corrected.  The hold times aren't terrible and they were always able to correct it without fuss but the fact that I have to keep calling them because of their faulty software/infrastructure sucks.  At least I'm an annual member and can readily see their inaccurate records by logging into my account online.  I'd hate it if I was a daily/weekly pass user and didn't find out about it until citibike billed me.5.  I wish I could access my account from the app.  That way, I don't have to use the kiosk to determine if their computers logged the return of the bike.The fact that this isn't their first rodeo -- as I understand it, the same company is responsible for bike share programs all over the world -- says to me that they're not going to, or maybe they're unable to, fix the glitches.  I can't believe that their other bike share systems in place don't experience the same issues."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/11/2014,"I like that this business is creating more bikers, but the system seems to be run by idiots. Checking in and locking up simply doesn't work at some stations. Customer service is horrendous, and refunds are passively denied by putting the caller on indefinite holds."
NYC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/13/2014,Citibike changed my life. It reduced the time and money that I spend on the subway considerably. The bikes themselves are quite comfy and speedy enough for NYC. The stations are placed conveniently for both commuting and for just getting around town. It takes a few weeks to really get good at knowing where the stations and when to worry about full or empty  bike racks. Citibike is the best thing to happen to NYC since I moved here 22 years ago.
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/24/2013,"This review is purely for the customer service department. I was told by a Citibike employee at an event that if you signed up for the annual membership that it would take about 2 weeks to receive your access card. But have no fear, he told me- just call customer service and they'll provide you with a 7 day access code to access your bike sooner. So I signed up and called customer service. Although the people on customer service, both the lady who answered the phone, and the ""team leader"" were very nice- neither were helpful. They told me they could not provide me with an access code, even though a team member had told me so. Although they wanted to fix the problem moving forward, they said they could do nothing for me. Citibike is already getting a really bad reputation in the City, and this does not help the situation. If they have team members telling people information on the streets, they need to follow through with it. Unfortunate customer service."
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/24/2014,"I would say the pros outweigh the cons here. I have using Citi Bike for a year now and I can honestly say it has improved my life and saved a truck load of money. I had the membership paid off in 3 months of not taking the subway. I have always wanted my own bike but honestly this is so much better. I work up at 38th and Broadway, last year there were never any bikes at those stations and I'd have to walk to 33rd street. Its not that big a deal to walk a few blocks to get a bike. This summer has improved I can now get a bike about 50% of the time--at rush hours. Much better and much faster and much more enjoyable then being on a hot subway platform."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/15/2013,"I thought that the Citibikes were a great idea, but was surprised and disappointed by what a bad, ineffectual system it is. I live in NYC and have my own bike, but my boyfriend and I wanted to try them out. We tried three times to use the bikes before giving up. The first time, the touch screen we tried was completely impossible to operate, even though the system had only been operational for 3 weeks. Yes, we could have gone to another site, but just ended up taking the subway. The second time, the code that was given for the bike didn't work. I tried it on every single bike in the rack, but none would open. I called the helpline and all they could do was re-set the code, not refund the money, which I wanted because I had lost all faith in this system. But one day a friend was visiting and we tried the bikes again. He has a Citibank Mastercard, the ""preferred card"" according to the Citibike computer, but his payment ""couldn't be processed.""So I am very surprised that so many people use these bikes. The fact that you have to dock your bike every 30 minutes, and clearly there are WAY too many kinks in the process of getting a new bike out of the rack, means this needs some serious improvement if it is ever going to be viable. It would never work for people who have to be somewhere at a certain time, if you have to worry about all of these issues. Maybe it would be acceptable for very patient tourists who have plenty of time to fart around, but not for anyone else. Very disappointing."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,02/23/2014,"A WORD TO THE WISE....DO NOT RIDE CITI BIKE... their docking stations dont work and will run up your time and charge you past your 30 minutes to receive more of your money. When calling to report, they have you on the phone for a long time and are rude. Their customer service sucks, I called to explain that their bikes were not docking correctly and was told their was nothing they can do about it and the charges will remain on your card. It is def not worth the hassle. I will NEVER ride with them again."
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/18/2014,"Bought two day passes for me and my bf to use while we were visiting NYC. Figuring out the costs was confusing, initially thinking we had to wait 30 mins before taking out a new bike but then realizing we just needed a new access code. We biked across the manhattan bridge and went to insert the bike, we made sure they were locked in. We walked and explored for about an hour and then tried to get another pair of bike to get back to our hotel. We received a message on the kiosk saying one of the bikes was not returned! I called the help line, the lady while polite was not very helpful. I asked her what I would be charged & what my options were. She basically told me that I had to wait for someone to get the bike and redeposit it another station or go back and check for it. In fear of the bike getting stolen and my card being charged, me and my bf decide to take a taxi from Soho back to the manhattan bridge costing me $13. Get there and the bike is locked in perfectly! Call back and the agent asks for a barcode number and says shell close the trip. This was a total inconvenience for us and costed us $13. This was very disappointing. I would recommend if you do get a day pass for CitiBike to make sure right away thats it locked and you can access another pass code to get another bike. Hopefully they work out these tweaks because ultimately this concept of bike sharing is great."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/09/2013,Disaster.  Got hit by a cab. The locations they chose to put the kiosks are redic. In major traffic areas with lots of opportunities for accidents.   The bike was returned late because of the accident and this heartless company refused to refund the extra time.  BIG SKIP for me!  And I live in NYC ! They ONLY care about $$.  Terrible!
NYC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/06/2013,"Would like to reduce it down to 1 1/2 but I can't.After over two months, one would have thought citibikes would have had time to work out its kinks.  However, they just seem to only get worse.  Again, it is a great program in concept but the actual execution has been shockingly poor for a city like NYC which tends to get other things right. A huge part of the problem lies in the pathetically AWFUL software (seriously, heads need to roll at the company that put this turkey out) that runs Citibikes.  I read that this had to do with a licensing dispute Alta (which runs Citibikes and similar programs in other cities) had with its previous software developer.  Understood.  But did it have to resort to going to what is obviously an untested developer to develop the software for the largest bikeshare system in the US????  The only other city using this same software system is Chattanooga, TN.  Chattanooga!!!  Software aside, there are also other issues like poor placement of the docks and the fact that docks seem to come in only two varieties - fully loaded with bikes so that you can't dock, or completely empty so you can't get a bike.  To make matters extra annoying, some docks can go from completely full one night to completely empty the next for no reason at all.  Anyway, I've detailed some of the issues with citibikes below.1) A Multitude of Malfunctioning Equipment. - I can't count how many times, I've pulled up to a dock stand, found one of the rare docks still open and tried to dock and only found that the reason the dock was open was because it was broken and did not allow the bike to be docked.  Part of the problem seems to me to be the fact that people - not knowing how to dock their bike (you have to lift it first and then drop it and allow the dock to latch it) - have taken to brute force slamming the bike into the dock.  No doubt this has led to many a broken dock.  The problem stems from the docks being designed so as to make it unnecessarily hard to dock the bike.  At the very least, some instruction on how to dock is needed and I'm surprised that the stands provide no such instruction. With that said, the bigger problem is software-related.  Again, it's that AWFUL software.  I've come across many stands where ALL the docks had a red LED light on - meaning that the bike docked in cannot be released because either the dock or the bike or both are not working.  Then there are the stands where 1/3 or 1/2 of the docks have the red LED.  Why so many?  My only guess is that citibikes is not maintaining their docks/bikes.  Once broken, they remain broken and thus there's a backlog of broken docks/bikes.  Needless to say, the generally poorly maintained and busted equipment make the entire program unreliable.  Basically, the program is like a lemon car.  You can't count on it getting you from point A to point B without breaking down.  In other words, you can't count on getting a bike at point A due to broken docks which would release a bike and you can't count on there being a functioning dock at the other end which can receive your bike.2) Dock Blockage - ANother major problem is that many dock stands are just full constantly and it is a struggle to find a stand with empty docks in certain neighborhoods - Midtown during the day, West Village, East Village and Battery Park City at night.  Again, this defeats the purpose of citibikes if you can't rely on there being an open dock to park your bike at.  Despite people saying that a lot of this is due to the unique density of NYC, a huge part of the problem is related to poor location of the dock stands (which I get into in 3) below.3) Poor locations of dock stands - It seems that, in deciding where to put the docks, they decided to randomly dump them wherever they felt that they would be the least opposed.  The locations make no logical sense.  For example, why are there NO stands at all in the FiDi west of Broadway????  Then you have Battery Park City which has large residential complexes and large office complexes served by only three stands.  Also, why are there so few dock sands along the very popular Hudson River and East River bike paths?????????????  There are two, count then TWO, bike stands along the Hudson river bike path (Chambers St and 42nd St) and THREE along the East River bike path (Staten Island Ferry terminal, Pier 11, and 35th St).  Then, if you're riding along the East River and looking to continue past 34th St, you must take a detour up First Avenue to get around the UN.  Again, this is another popular bike route.  However, the first stand on First Ave after you pass 34th St isn't until you get to 44th St!!!!  4) The App - AWFUL!!!!!!  This one is shamefully bad.  It is absolutely painful to use since it takes forever to load and the map takes forever to move around.  What's more, it is completely inaccurate.  It is always showing open docks where there aren't any."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/02/2013,literally twenty seconds over the time limit because the docking station we went to was full.I Contacted customer service via phone and they informed me that i had to email to try to get this waived. They emailed me back saying that they couldnt waive this but a friend of mine was thirty seconds over and it got waived? hmmm shady practice I will never use this again and inform my friends of this scheme they have going
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/29/2013,"The concept of Citi bikes is awesome for those who are tired of waiting for a train in those overheated platforms. However, the Citi bike definitely took some time getting used to.  I am a short person standing at 5'0 ft tall.  Even with the seat adjusted to the lowest, my feet could barely touch the ground.  Although, it was fun riding the bike, I did always have to think twice every time I stopped to ensure my foot actually touched the ground and I wouldn't fall over.  It would be nice if the bikes were built for those who are vertically challenged as I am."

NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/11/2015,"Super misleading. We rented two bikes for 1 hour and a half thinking we had a 24 hour pass for each bike. After checking my credit card statement, I found 3 charges. One for $202 as a credit hold to be returned (never warned about), the $22.00 for the 24 hour pass, AND a $54 charge for using both bikes for longer than 30 minutes under the understanding that we had them for 24 hours (never warned about). What?! How can you market your pricing structure as $10 for 24 hours but then only allow your customers to use the bike for 30 minutes without incurring additional fees. That is so misleading and straight up criminal! Nowhere did it say that the bikes were good for only 30 minutes within the 24 hour period that we thought we got them for. I feel bad for people who rent them for the full 24 hours and are paying upwards of $500 thinking they only have to pay $10. You could buy a bike with the amount it takes to rent this piece of crap for a full day. Please don't use this service!"
NYC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/20/2013,"I tried Citibike last Saturday because I won a 24hr pass at the Summer Streets event. Overall I think that the system is a great idea but needs a lot of work. To begin with, finding a bike rack with bikes can be challenging. There's a station right in front of my building and every time I go out there's only one or two bikes docked and at least one of them happens to be out of order. Also, the machine's software is very buggy so it took forever to get a bike in the first place. The person in front of me bought a daily pass yet the machine wouldn't read his card when he requested a new code so that was $10 wasted. The 30 minute limit per ride is also annoying because you always have to be aware of where you're going to dock the bike. If you're in midtown or lower manhattan, finding a station is not that hard but in other areas the number of stations is lacking. I feel like the program will be better once it grows and becomes more widespread throughout the city. I did enjoy riding the bike up 1st ave and down 2nd ave because of the green bike lanes which make riding less stressful."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/11/2013,"let's count the ways how terrible citibike is1. all bike racks are empty or broken2. when you can get a bike, impossible to return because racks are broken or filled3. real-time app is not real-time and shows inaccurate dataso basically citibike makes my life more inconvenient because i have to go out of my way to find a bike and return a bike, completely useless"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/16/2015,"The concept is great, but in practice it doesn't work. All summer I've wanted to use the bikes but have not been able to. Why? Because they don't ""balance"" the stations. Too many times, every bike station in the area of one's destination has no available docks, or two few to count on there being one available when you arrive. I learned this the hard way one night when I spent 30 minutes searching for a free dock and ended up almost as far away from my destination as I started. Other stations have no bikes. They are supposed to ""rebalance"" the docking stations routinely every day to avoid these problems, but they don't spend the money to do it. At this point, I have found that about 70% of the time that I want to use the bikes I can't because docks at stations near locations I'm going have no slots. I've called to complain several times about particular areas. As far as I can tell, this accomplishes nothing; days after the complaints all stations in the union square area have virtually no free docks. Then they charge you a large fee for a key that you can use for ""unlimited"" rides. It's beyond annoying that they don't offer reasonable memberships in which you pay per ride, so that they are only compensated if they can offer you a service. Just be aware that if you buy a membership, it won't provide you unlimited rides. And if you pay per ride they make it cumbersome and absurdly expensive. Take the subway!"
NYC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/24/2013,"Great idea and will be a wonderful asset to the city. Teething problems have to be resolved.Two of us tried the 24 hour pass on Sunday.Pros:Bikes are comfortable and in good condition3 gears; a bell; a carrier rack; seat easy to adjustThe Citi smartphone app is very good - it shows the number of bikes and available slots at each docking stationCons:The initial sign-up takes far too long and is confusing e.g. at one point they say hit 'Next' and 'Next' is nowhere to be found; it's a forward arrow.As a result, at popular docking stations, the lines are long and move slowly.Using a day pass, we ran into three very different problems: - trying to return a bike within the 30 minute-deadline, no slots available at first station we tried, headed to a second station and were told by others leaving that it was full, had difficulty finding a third station until we realized it was on the other side of the street. Once we got there, a family of French tourists were having a terrible time trying to get bikes. So we were about 15 minutes late.- tried to return a bike later in the day and the empty slots weren't 'accepting' the bikes. You can't leave a bike that is not firmly held by the docking station.- After scurrying to an alternative station, we returned the bikes successfully but then despite multiple attempts, no bikes were being released; others at the same station had the same problem including one person with an annual membership.Eventually we just got on a bus up 10th Avenue.I think that 30 minutes is too short particularly for tourists who don't know how long it takes to get from one attraction to another. You've barely got your bike and you have to start worrying about the mechanics of returning it.Another issue - and not one that the city can resolve - tough to be so reliant on an app on a bright day when you can't see your screen easily.If you run out of juice on your smartphone, you are dead in the water.For tourists, who I assume are mostly using wireless, the inability to use the app would be a problem.I'd give it a whirl but only if you are relaxed and don't have to worry about meetings or other commitments.It can only get better."
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/24/2013,"Customer service is terrible!My husband and I rented out two bikes for the very first time and unfortunately misread their misleading pricing.  We were under the impression that you pay $9.95 for a 24 hour period.  In a different section, it says that you can only have the bikes for 30 minute periods.  Their kiosks are not even placed at eye level.  We returned the bikes after 2.5 hours, thinking we were within our time alloted, and later saw a $154 charge on our credit card!  I called customer service to inquire about the charge and asked for some sort of break as it is insane to pay $154 ($120 +$34 in tax!) for a 2.5 hour bike ride.  Any large company forgives first time mistakes and works with their customers.  The representatives I spoke to were condescending and heartless, and did nothing to help us with this insanely high charge.  This is a big rip off.  We will only be renting bikes from local businesses in the future!"
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/23/2013,Terrible experience stations broken- had to go to three different stations to dock bike and then to find out a month later I was charged $30 for 4 minutes of overtime.  When I called to customer service they told me I should have requested the extra 15 minutes of time.  Nice theory if the station would have worked and been able to swipe my card to request.  Customer service rude and no credit given back. I will continue to write reviews as until justice is done.  Reading the other reviews I'm not alone
NYC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/08/2013,"First time riding a citibike and sorely disappointed.  My first bike station was near Fulton Street. Lo and behold, the code does not work for both my husband and I. Customer service is called and they tell us to walk over to another bike station. After wasting about fifteen minutes in the first bike station, we walk about fifteen minutes for the second bike station. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? The credit card reader is out of service. I was frustrated but I wanted to experience riding a bike on the Brooklyn Bridge. We take another ten minute walk and finally find another citibike station. Finally, my code works but my husband has to call customer service again because his code does not work. I realize that the bike is too high for me even after I have adjusted the seat. THIS BIKE IS NOT MEANT FOR SHORT PEOPLE(rides better if you are above 5'5 in height). I had lots of trouble riding this bike because my feet would have difficulty touching the ground when I had to stop. It was too bulky and heavy. Too expensive for long rides if you do not switch bikes after 30 minutes! Will not be renting from this service again!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/24/2019,"Reasonable price, very easy to rent and the bikes rode great.   Can't wait to ride them again."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/16/2019,MAKE SURE YOU READ EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU RENT. Misleading rate information. The whole instruction and pricing structure is to manipulate first time riders to think the day membership let's you keep the bike for the day. Later you'll find that even though you paid for 24h you can only take the bike 30 minutes at a time before they charge you additional fees. Found out later of their pricing then the next day I was charged 32$ for the additional time on the bike.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/17/2019,"I agree with those saying that you need to READ THE SMALL PRINT! My boyfriend and I went on a ride for a few hours on a nice day and were charged $75! The machine was telling us it would just be $15, but apparently that was just for the first 30 minutes. I later read online that this service is more like a ""Lyft for bikes,"" so you are only supposed to take the bikes for 30 minutes or less, otherwise you have to re-dock them every 30 minutes to avoid facing huge overcharges. This was not clear when we checked the bikes out. I felt that overcharges were very misleading. Luckily, the company will reimburse your charges the first time, so make sure you give them a call: 877-430-2453."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/15/2019,"I live in the DC area and we've used the service a couple of times. It's such a great way to show friends the city. We used them most recently a couple of weeks ago for about two hours. We went to dock the bikes (there are guidelines for this, you watch videos, etc. to learn how) and began receiving texts that the bike wasn't docked. We returned to the docking station to make sure it was docked and did all their ""checks"" -- the bikes were docked. We called Capital Bikeshare three times and emailed twice that night, trying to solve the problem, but got no response. The next day we FINALLY got in touch with them and they immediately told us we'd be subject to a $1,200 stolen bike fee (?!). I explained the situation, that we had checked the bikes and tried to resolve the issue, and they said someone had JUST found the bike (?!) so they would make the feee $60 instead. I continued to ask questions and before long, when it was clear they weren't interested in what I was saying, I asked for a customer service number and the name of the representative. She said she didn't have to give me any information and hung up on me. I then contacted Lyft, the company who owns Capital Bikeshare, and was totally ignored for two weeks after multiple customer service tickets. (Keep in mind, they require your credit card info before you ride so they can charge you for anything they want afterward.) Ultimately, these bikes are a fun and cool idea. But know that if you ride them you're opening yourself up to $1,200 in fees if ANYTHING goes wrong (even if their technology fails!) with absolutely no customer service. I am not willing to take that risk, and unfortunately will not be using these bikes again."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,02/18/2019,"Capital Bikeshare has demonstrated that a well run, well maintained system partnering private sector with government can work on a large scale. For the most part, the dockless competing bikeshare companies have come and gone. This is a testament to the viability and health of the dock stationed based system. There are so many stations that you never feel you're out of touch with a rental or a refresh on your ride. The bikes are well maintained and they fit taller riders well. I really enjoyed using the bikeshare during my visit to the city."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/05/2018,"Read before you rent! Every 30 minutes you must dock the bike. You cannot ride continuously for more than 30 minutes so plan your trips accordingly! Dock the bike every 30 minutes and check it out again. If you download the app it's easy to find a dock close to your destination. You can also see how many docks and bikes are at each location.  We rented these bikes several times on our 3 day trip in DC and had a wonderful time zipping through the city! Each ride is $2 for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes you will be charged late fees. I don't know how much the late charges are because all our rides were exactly 30 minutes or less. You can get an all day pass for $8 so if you plan on taking more than 4 trips that's a good deal. You still have to dock the bikes every 30 minutes. It's very easy to find a dock, but I do think 30 minutes is a bit ridiculous. They should make it 45 minutes. Most of the bikes are in good condition. They are very popular during the evenings for some reason. There are a few electric bikes floating around if you luck up on one. We had a hard time finding 2 bikes after sunset. Using the app we were able to monitor the nearest dock and find out when 2 bikes became available. The one positive about the 30 minute time limit is that a bike may be coming soon if you're waiting for one. However, this doesn't guarantee a bike is coming. If someone just needs an extra 30 minutes to ride they can dock and rent out the same bike again. There are a few bike lanes in DC, but unless you have a helmet or are very experienced riding alongside cars I wouldn't recommend the bike lanes. Plenty of people ride bikes and electric scooters on the sidewalks and there is enough room. Watch out for people that walk like they're drunk, are distracted by cellphones, people who take up the whole sidewalk, and people who are just completely oblivious to the world around them. I had fun using the bell and scaring people."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,02/13/2019,"The docks and bikes don't work also the promo codes. Lots of potential, sad how poorly run this system is. I'll be buying a bike."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/25/2018,"Bikes didn't dock properly, one went missing. Looking at a steep $1200 fine (wtf?) if it doesn't turn up. Ruined my DC trip. Be careful while returning bikes.Edit: bike was eventually returned. I called up customer service to cancel my day passes, which they complied with."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/29/2017,"Capital Bikeshare is another major city bike-share program that works quite well, IMHO.I've enjoyed city bikes in Montreal, Boston and D.C. and found them an excellent way to explore a city.To best enjoy the benefits of the program, I recommend visiting the Captal Bikeshare website to fully understand how it works - easier than standing at a Bikeshare kiosk trying to figure out what the heck you are supposed to do.The bikes themselves are built like tanks - they have to be.  As an avid rider of expensive bikes, I have a great appreciation for the bike-share beasts.  Frankly, I find them very stable and easy to handle.  I like the bell, flashing LED lights and the basket on the front of the bike - all quite useful. Most bikes are in decent shape, however some squeak and are a little more beat up than others.As far as billing, it's quite clear that the intent of these bikes are to use them for under thirty minutes at-a-time and there is a modest charge for 30+ minutes. During my recent afternoon exploration in D.C., I bought a 24 hour pass ($8) and used 9 different bikes with only one 30+ minute ride (additional $2).  Basically, $10 for several hours of riding, docking bikes, walking around and riding again.)So, if you like to get out and about and have a flair for adventure, Capital Bikeshare bikes are the ticket.  It's fun to plan a sightseeing adventure, grab a bike, roll from rack to rack and walk a bit in-between.5 stars from this cyclist!Oh, and bring your own helmet if you so desire."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/16/2018,"I love these bikes! $2 for 30 min isn't a bad price either! You can get to most major spots within a half hour of each other for sure so it's nice and remains semi-cheap. The bike racks for pick up and drop off are literally everywhere and they go around and pull some from the over populated racks and bring them to the low supply areas every once and awhile throughout the day so that everywhere always has some! It's a great way to get around especially if you don't have your own bike, they have Day, week and year passes too if you know you'll be using it a lot, which is helpful! They're easy to use and return and send you emails to confirm everything. Bikeshare in general is such a great concept!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/02/2019,"ZERO stars!!!!  Please don't commit to these shysters (my opinion).For a service that is supposed to provide convenience - it's nothing but a headache 95% of the time.  Pure frustration - broken bikes, docs that are full, so you can't return your bike and may have to visit numerous racks taking you far out of your way,,, keys that swell up for no reason and don't work, etc etc. and the customer service is a JOKE.  The fine print on a yearly contract - IF you call and ""cancel"" your membership, they keep your money --- no refunds!!!  and you are not allowed to take out bikes for the remainder of your term.  So, I called in a moment of frustration - to inform them a station was not working / or perhaps it was my key,,,and the agent suggested I try all 20 bikes on the rack / and or go to another rack.  LOL --- well, sure, that sounds reasonable!!!  I have all day to walk from rack to rack and insert my key at every bike.  NP!  That's exactly how I want to spend my time - in the cold rain no less!  (#*%@!!)So, when I said I'd like to cancel my membership in a moment of despair after three stations not working, lacking bikes, etc -- being a prepaid member -- the agent informed me - and I quote ""you can NOT cancel your membership, you are prepaid,, but, I can take you off auto-renewal"" - I asked - ""am I still able to rent bikes until the end of my term?"" - Her answer:  ""YES!"" ---- However, that is not the case.  Capital Bikeshare is NOT reinstating my membership for the remainder of PRE-PAID time left, AND they are suggesting I PURCHASE a new membership -- So double pay??!?!?!?!?    Let me think about that.  Ummmmm, NOOOOOOOOO!f-ing RIDICULOUS.I'm a long time member - and have put up with all the flaws in their system, and yet they don't have my best interests at heart...  it's very disappointing, as I think the concept is great in the city!!    It's a poorly run company with HORRIBLE customer service in my opinion.  And it is my advice to buy your own bike,, or seek another option.  I would definitely advise NOT to sign up for any contracts -- you could be out money, like I am.It's super disheartening to see they will not step up to the plate and do the right thing ---  refunding me or honoring the time left that I've PAID FOR..... I also see some positive reviews on here that I look a little sketchy to me - I've heard MANY horror stories of being overcharged etc.--  avoid Capital Bikeshare.. Try the scooters, etc.  Don't deal with a company that does not appreciate you!!!!  The only thing they provide is 100% frustration / 0% support."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,05/06/2017,"For my 1st time usage of Capital Bikeshare all went well. I wanted to walk the 2.5 miles & my co-worker wanted to bike it...she paid, easy compromise. I didn't hover while she used her credit card to obtain the print out code used to unlock the bike from the secured docking station. You have 15 seconds to input the code or you'll have to start over. Just my luck that Alex, a Bikeshare employee was present checking bikes. I took that advantage to ask the questions I do so well as a newbie. You can pay per trip, get a 24 hour pass or sign up for an annual membership...the 'under 30 minutes' is the key factor in what you will pay.  Over 3500 bikes within 440 stations & counting. If a bike is not rideable, he radios his counterparts, provides the information & then loads the bikes into the van...looked like a patty wagon on a positive note. These are not tour de france bicycles, yet they are comfortable enough to get you to where you are going. If you get tired before your destination, there are massive docking stations in close proximity to drop the bike off. How do you know how close a docking station is you may ponder? My co-worker has an App (real time programming) that shows where the nearest docking station is located & the availability.There's no colorful basket with streamers present, yet a bungee cord apparatus that securely holds your tote, briefcase or what have you. I appreciate the bike lanes, it's a small safeguard...using a helmet is a bigger one.  Back to the banter of walking & such, I asked my co-worker how she'd be able to ride in her pumps...just as easy as I rode in my dress. & we blended in amongst the masses of red bikes just fine."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/05/2018,Would rate 0 if I could. I took a bike trip with my friend on the Mt. Vernon Trail and paid almost 10 times as much as we thought. Did not understand the business model from the signs and don't understand how you're essentially buying another bike every 30 minutes with overage fees after already paying rental fees. I will never use this service again.P.S. be prepared to have customer services hang up on you at least twice before taking your call/calling back.
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,12/01/2016,"Bottom Line: A good concept that needs some refinement as does DC's bike lanes.I like the idea of communal rental bikes but I think Capital Bikeshare could execute a lot better.  For starters, the pricing and rules can be confusing.  First you have to purchase a membership and there are about five choices.  Next you pay by the minute but you have to redock the bike every so often or you'll get charged extra. So if your feet need a break and you want to ride a short distance to the closet Metro station it would cost about $8 which isn't worth it.Recently, because of the Metro Safetrak initiative Capital Bikeshare is temporarily offering $2 rides if you return the bike under 30 minutes.  If Capital Bikeshare adopts this model for the long term I think I would easily give it four stars.There are stations all over the DC area so that is great although the stations could be empty when you need a bike or full when you need to return one.  That is a bummer and probably means more walking. The bikes are durable which means they are heavy so no popping wheelies or Tour de France sprints.Helmets aren't available but are often needed. If you're a tourist wanting to cover lots of ground in the federal city you might want to consider renting a bike AND helmet through Bike and Roll.  I suspect they might even provide route maps.  Exploring DC by bike is great because you can get to places that are not accessible by the Metro like the Jefferson Memorial.About those helmets, biking parts of DC can be very challenging. You can't legally ride on sidewalks or even on the gravel paths along the National Mall. Although that isn't really enforced as evidenced by all of the people doing it, I'm a rule follower so I try to stick to the road.  The trick about that is you might find yourself riding in the wrong direction an extra 1/4 mile because you get stuck on a one way street or divided highway.  There are few dedicated bike lanes and they often run down the center of traffic lanes instead of along the shoulder."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/25/2018,"Very misleading 24h pass: you pay 8$ and can use the bike for 24h but what's only in the small print and really easy to overlook is that you have to put the bike in a docking station every 30 mins. If you keep the bike for longer than 30 mins they charge a service fee of another's 8$ each time you overrun. So we went for a longer bike ride, using 3 bikes total and paid 24$ despite having the 24h pass. Scam alarm! Already deleted my app and won't use Capital Bikeshare ever again."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/19/2018,"Code malfunctioned. Beware of unfair customer service policy. I paid for two 24-hr bike passes. However, the code would not release any of the bikes from their docks. When I called in, customer service said that their system showed that 2 bicycles had been released from the dock and that I was responsible for the bicycles even though I never took a bicycle out. When it became obvious that there was a glitch in the system (there was a discrepancy in my printed time slip and their data on when the bikes were released) ,  I was told that I would STILL  be responsible for two missing bicycles and that I'd have to file a police report for stolen bicycles which I never even undocked. Long story short, even after having proof that I never even released the bicycles, Capital Bikeshare would not refund me my two 24-hour passes because I had activated them on my first ride.  I am a strong supporter of the bike share program, but the system is flawed, and it has terrible customer service policy."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,09/05/2018,"For the most part, had a great experience with Capital Bikeshare during our trip to DC. We bought 2 3 day passes for us. Unfortunately the bike passes stopped working the end of the second day, and wouldn't allow us to log in. We tried from both our phones. We will be reaching out to CaBi's customer service, stay tuned! Another bad thing, *extremely* uncomfortable after biking for so long!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/08/2017,"As many have mentioned, read the information and instructions before purchasing.  We got the 3 day pass and never had any difficulties or extra charges with it.  The only two minor  difficulties we had was when one of the machines was was not touch screen sensitive, and the other was when there weren't any bikes left.  Very minor issues, that could be solved by going to a neighbouring bike share location. Please do keep in mind that they are free if your trip is under 30 minutes! It would be difficult if you're not on data to find the closest station, so I would recommend taking a picture of the map if you're not able to use data. Overall, cheaper than the Metro and best way to see DC! It was faster for us to ride bikes than wait for the metro at many of our destinations!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/06/2016,"What's with all the hate on here? I mean are these fake yelp reviews or what? I'm a fan. We enjoyed our bike ride and the system was easy to use. No scary bike stealing. No horror stories about fees. It was fine. There are bike stations all over. You'll be glad you rented a bike instead of walking or dealing with traffic. These are no frills tourist-y bikes, okay. Don't be trying to pull out your cervelo fanciness, okay?It'll pay off to look at the map and do some planning ahead. Sure, the fees can be confusing at first. And yeah I have to admit that it's crummy to try and return your bike only to find the rack is completely full. Minus one star."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/05/2018,First: Watch a YouTube video on how to use this system.Second: be very careful on learning the pricing.Third: download the app SpotCycle.Forth: buy you day or 3 day membership -rent your bicycle for short distances.Under 30min are no extra charge.This is a great way to see Washington DC.
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/18/2018,"I love the concept of Capital Bikeshare! I randomly decided to take a 5 mile bike ride one day. Great experience but I'd definitely make sure to know exactly where your destination CB station is. I had a brief moment of frustration when I didn't know where the station was and my phone had died so I couldn't use google maps. I eventually found the station and I docked the bike and continued my day. The second time I used CB was a bit more chaotic because when I docked the bike to return it, the light was green instead of red when I walked away. This is bad because the light is supposed to be red when you walk away. So I was still being charged and didn't know until I received a text hours later. I called customer service and I ended up having to go back to the docking station to find the bike to dock it correctly. It sounds like a nightmare but it wasn't that bad. The woman with customer service was very polite and patient. I was given a serial number to look for and when I found it  I was able to undock, then dock it back correctly. All charges were waived as well. I would definitely use CB again and remember when you dock the bike the light must be red! :)"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/07/2018,Beware.  You rent for 24 hours.  You MUST check in every 30 minutes and they do not tell you.  It started out being a wonderful way to tour DC but then quite a disappointment with hidden fees.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/27/2017,"SCAM ALERT!! READ THE FINE PRINT, BE CAREFUL. I do not support this company.I do not support this company based on principal of their shady business practices.I do not have enough bad things to say about this company, their people, and their practices...About a week ago, I first rented a bike to take to the grocery store. Starting off, the touch screens were broken and it was a very poor experience attempting to get a bike rental. I can only assume based on this that maybe they don't upkeep the equipment well enough. Okay, so bad first impression, but once i finally got a bike, it obviously worked fine as a bike should. No flats, no issues, no problems.However, the second time I rented a bike, it was for a ""24 hour"" period of time, quoted at ""$8"" for the entire period. Now comes the fun part... a few days later i was charged an additional $94!!Apparently, you are supposed to dock the bike every 30 minutes or else you will be charged outrageous amounts for the time (that you supposedly already paid for). This is not disclosed in an obvious location or anywhere in the prompting on the tiny screen in front of you. This is only noted in the extremely long and arduous to read ""Terms & Conditions"" (which by the way is about 156 pages or so, and would take hours to read on the tiny screen provided for you)I immediately called Capital Bikeshare to dispute this charge and see if they would give me a one time waive, considering I did not damage the bike and followed what I had believed were the appropriate procedures. I spoke with 1 lady, Lawanda, who was a smart-alec and not helpful... She was only offering a 50% reduction of my fee and was trying to help get management (UNACCEPTABLE). Unfortunately I had to hang-up for another call coming in. I then had to call back and spoke with Brandy, who could not get her phone off of speaker or was having some kind of feedback loop issue with the audio. That may not have been her fault, but regardless, not helping my frustrations. At this point I am incredibly fed up and disgusted with this company. I have read other reviews online dealing with similar situations I had only realized after the fact.In summary, I am livid with these people and the company and hope I can get this charge waived. I will have only horrible things to say/share and will deter people from using this service if the topic comes up in conversation.  Hopefully management can reach out and help to fix my perception."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/13/2018,"Out visiting DC with a friend and we decided that it might be fun to rent a bike.  How hard could it be?  Downloaded the app and set everything up.  Not a single obvious detail about pricing other than $2 per half hour and first trip is free.  Nothing about docking the bike every half hour.  Rode the bikes and was charge $30 for two hours........seriously.  Pretty devious!  Sadly most people aren't going to check Yelp before they rent a bike.  Otherwise, they wouldn't have used Capital Share!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/13/2018,Hell yeah!! Now that they lowered the prices down to $2 the rides are getting more awesome than assome! I'm really loving my bicycle ride shares since August 2nd 2018. This not only stigmatized more bikers but it got me to getting a new bicycle and an indoor bike rack. I'm extremely happy about my met fitness goals from Capital Bikeshare which allowed me to bike each week after week with resolving other bike costs to within the means. Thank you Capital Bikeshare for eleaviating my cardio routine and making DC a better place to transport cross town and making bikes available to all those who can do it! Happy customer finally after!
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/31/2017,"Total scam, don't waste your money . . .After months of walking past 2 bikeshare  stations connecting my Adams Morgan home to the Woodley Park Metro, I decided to purchase a membership and, in so doing, trade my 10-min walk for a 3-min bike ride. Big mistake.I purchased a 1-year membership, allowing unlimited 30-minute rides. Initially, I was happy with the service, using it primarily for traveling to the Metro (a 4-block, 3-min trip) on workdays. As I got used to the service, I began using it for trips to my gf's condo on the West End (a 2.5 mile, 20-min trip) on days when I didn't want to drive. But recently I came face-to-face with the unfair billing practices that other reviewers have complained about.  A recent review of my credit card statement revealed that I was charged $110 (an amount that is even more than I had paid for the year-long membership) for two trips--one to Woodley Park Metro and one to the West End. When I called to find out why I had been charged so much, I was accused of having had the bike in my possession for several hours (4 hours for one trip and 7 hours for the other). When I denied having ever spent more than 20 minutes on any single trip, the customer service rep suggested there was nothing she could do.Because all records of how long you've kept a bike on any given trip are maintained internally, there is really no way to disprove the company's claims or dispute excessive charges. The service can charge whatever they want at any given time and put you in the impossible position of proving a negative--that you didn't have a bike for as long as they claim you have. Rather than continue with the service, I've simply filed a dispute with my CC, canceled my membership (with 6 months remaining) and moved on. There are some companies whose business model is predicated on defrauding customers, paying back customers when forced, and holding on to the profits from those who either don't notice the fraud or choose to avoid the hassle of challenging. This appears to be such a company. This has the potential to be a decent service, but not as it currently operates. If you want a bike, just buy your own. This company is to be avoided at all costs.***If you currently use this service, make sure you are checking your credit card statements each month. They don't contact customers when excess charges are applied and simply charge the credit card that is used to secure the membership.***"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/08/2018,"On a quick weekend trip to D.C. my husband and I parked at a metro-station and took the metro into D.C. on a Friday where we walked and saw the sites, we spent the night at Hamilton hotel and spend the following Saturday in D.C. then left around 4pm. We purchased a 24 hour pass at 5pm on Friday and used the bikes three times. Once to ride around the Tidal Basin and to our Hotel, once to Union Station to grab some food and see the place and then again to the Museum of the Bible. All of which had amazingly close and convenient parking docks. The seats where uncomfortable for me and the bike was a tad too tall even on the shortest seat setting which I feel played a factor in the extreme discomfort. However, I highly recommend using this service due to its cheap price, convenience and copious docking locations. Taking a bike ride around the Tidal Basin was probably my favorite part of the entire trip highly recommend!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,11/30/2017,"I really love Capital Bikeshare.  When using it as intended, for short trips it is inexpensive and very easy to use.  I use it for occasional one way trips on my evening commute either all the way home from my office (~4 miles) or from the metro to home.  I have an annual membership, which at this point has paid for itself both in time saved and what I would have spent on metro/bus.  The bikes are heavy, slow, wobbly, and sometimes they are broken.   Don't expect them to be as nice as your personal bike, they are not exactly great for riding down Mt Vernon trail but on streets they are good.  I've ended up with a few that had mechanical issues and swapping them out for repair is easy enough.  I like the storage on the front and the lights are helpful.  If you want to cut out WMATA for all or part of your commute once in a while try the bikeshare.   You won't enjoy trying to bike from the mall to mount vernon or ride around downtown for 4 hours."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/23/2018,"Seriously, a ""membership"" to rent a bike to go from point a to point b and then drop it off? Give me a break, what a terrible business model. There are way better options and many companies doing it better. Ford Go, LimeBike, Spin, etc. I generally like the kiosk system because you don't have to spend time hunting them down if you need more than one, but this price gouging for something that is otherwise so good for earth friendly transportation is an insult."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/15/2018,"My daughter And I had a morning to wander DC before we had to return home, so we thought it would be fun to ride bikes to the Capital Building.  We picked up our bikes at one of the Kiosks, rode to our destination and returned in about an hour. We put the bikes in the dock, I quickly received a text saying we had been successful and we left, happy for our time in DC. Then, hours later while I am in the security line at the airport, I received a second text saying that a bike had not been returned and I was incurring charges. I called the number provided and was told I needed to return to the kiosk and re-dock the bike. Clearly, returning was not a possibility, and I explained that both bikes were returned together, that I had made a single reservation for two bikes, and had received a message saying we had successfully returned. I did realize after I called that the text message said a particular bike # had been returned but I assumed this was a reservation number for both bikes. The customer service rep. said since I couldn't return to re-dock  the bike, somebody from the company would have to go do it..... in approximately three hours... and I would incur charges of $8/30min until the bike had been re-docked. RIDICULOUS! When I asked to speak to a manager, I was told I could call back and try to speak with a different representative but they were following company policy and I would only hear the same from anyone I spoke with. This has been the WORST customer service experience I have had in a very, very long time. I would absolutely dissuade anyone from using Capital Bikeshare. There are many better ways to get around DC; walking comes to mind."

DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/11/2018,My husband and I rented bikes when we were in DC over Memorial Weekend. We thought it would be fun and an easy way to get around. I had never rented bikes before so I looked through the options and I picked what I believed to be the $8 24hour pass after reading the options.  I just saw the charge on my bill. $16 for the the pass AND another $94.00. I am so livid right now. The pricing is INSANELY MISLEADING. NEVER AGAIN! $110 to rent bikes. Con artists.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/06/2018,Horrible!  What a joke in how to run a business.  First off we rented out bikes at night.  The touch screen said 8$ a day.  Fair enough.  I didn't know till afterwards you have to dock your bike every 30 minutes to negate late fees.  What??? My buddy who took his bike back to the hotel room overnight was charged 95$.  He called the business and got it reduced to 55$.  Thumbs down.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/19/2017,"Charged $94 for an hour bike ride. Happened to catch the overage on my credit card statement. Called customer no service and they said I was at fault, no refund. No chance to dispute this with management at all. They just gave me an email address and a nice stiff arm. I just ended up filing a dispute on my credit card so will wait and see. Seems to me a bike monopoly used to get money out of unsuspecting tourists for fines. Wonder how they wrote up the business plan for that one."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/07/2017,"Had an issue where my bike didn't register as returned. The girl I called and spoke to told me there was nothing she could do unless I can verbally tell her the bike is in the dock. I had to go all the way back to the dock and just say it was there. Then magically her supervisor lifted the late fees....  needless to say I'm pretty pissed offAlso incase you didn't know the thief's at bike share with only charge 2.00 for 30 mins, but once your ""late"" they charge an additional 30.00.... F*ck that. Never again"
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/28/2017,"Bikeshare is a great idea, but the actual bikes suck. They are heavy, unwieldy, slow and unsafe. I bike to work (on my own road bike) everyday, but last week had to rent a Bikeshare while mine was in the shop. The front steering column is so heavy and clunky that you have to use a lot of arm strength to hold it steady when starting, stopping, or turning. Its center of gravity is off, so if you're not careful you could fall over while turning and the heavy-ass bike will crush your legs and you will eat the pavement.The worst part is how slow they are. If I ever end up behind them in a bike lane, I watch out for the first opportunity to pass them because hey, I ain't got all day. Also most of the people riding them are inconsiderate and rude bikers who have no regard for traffic laws. Capital Bikeshare needs to replace their outdated fleet of shitty bikes, fix their bike machine panels where you rent them out, lower the cost from $8/day (what if I just want to do one 20 minute ride? I'd rather just take a taxi and pay $6) and do some rider education about basic traffic laws. (Don't bike on the sidewalk, signal when turning, don't bike next to your boyfriend at .0000001 MPH while hogging an entire bike lane because you're oohhhh so cute.)I see a lot of white entitlement on these bikes."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/14/2017,"BE VERY CAREFUL WITH DAY PASSES. Their website says it's $8 for a 24 hour pass. They have an odd definition of 24 hours. This only allows you to use the bike in 30 minute increments--returning it each time to a station. I made the mistake of taking two visitors on a tour of DC for an afternoon and got stuck with a $140 bill instead of $16. Their customer service people were not understanding and not able to waive any of this. If the 24-hour price listed on their site simply mentioned ""30-minute increments"" below it, I would have explored the details. While I understand their program now (with a much lighter wallet), it's not consistent with the common expectation of ""24-hour pass."" I really feel ripped off and will be hesitant to use them again or recommend them. If you are a regular member, it works well."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/25/2018,"Understand the fee structure first!! Wish I had read the other reviews before we checked out our bikes. My husband and I got them through the app during a fun trip to DC. We bought the 24 hr pass so we could ride around the National Mall. It was a ton of fun and we loved being able to see everything for the almost 3 hrs we had the bikes. But then we got home and saw that they had charged us $16 for the 24 hr pass (which we expected) and then another $60!!! When I went to see why we had been charged so much, there it was, on a hidden page that is hard to find. The fee structure says they can charge crazy amounts of money if you go over the 30 minute time limit but this isn't clear at all in the ""24 hour pass"" option. They purposely make it deceiving so that people have to pay more and it's really dishonest. I'm sad that what was a positive memory is now shaded by this frustrating experience. We definitely wouldn't have paid $76 for 3 hours on a bike had we known."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/20/2018,Sucks. Bikes are usually in terrible shape. The 30 min rule is ridiculous.  The app will tell you no bikes at a station and you walk up and there is 3. ZERO customer service if you try and call them.  Love the concept but this company is a fail!
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/12/2017,"BEWARE: When renting bikes of the fine print they hide that you have to return the bike every 30 min or you get charged an addition $30 per bike. This is a scam to get more money as it's hidden in the fine print. When I called to complain, they just fell back on I should have paid more attention to the contract. Shame on me for not reading all 133 pages of fine print on the little 4 inch screen."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/05/2017,Like most other reviewers on here I was unaware that there were any usage fees for over 30 minutes even when you purchase a day pass. It is not clearly advertised at stations that these fees exist. We paid $16 for 2 day passes and were charged an additional $44 in fees. This should be clearly advertised at all bike stations. It's not really worth it to have to go find a bike dock every 30 minutes because you'll probably spend half the time looking for the nearest station/figuring out how to dock the bike/accessing a new code.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/09/2018,"When something goes wrong the mask slips. I docked my bike correctly. They email and hour later to say I have not docked the bike correctly. I get that email 8 hours later and 3 miles from the dock. I call, they don't deviate from the Visio flow chart. Computer says no. You failed. You owe us. You owe us $150 in lost revenue and if the bike is lost up to the cost of the bike. It's is on you the customer to make this right they make clear. Go back and check. Or request a rep to go check. I ask if that is by request only then how much will it cost? They are deliberately vague. I walk 3 miles back to the dock. 8 hours after the event. The bike is docked like I said it was.Thank you for telling us they say we will send a rep out however until that happens you are on the hook for the costs. Why? Because computer says no. The Visio flowchart doesn't allow for the customer to be right or the contractor to be proactive. The customer must ask us to be helpful."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/06/2018,"This is the best way to get around DC; instead of UBER all the time and Metro. Exercise is important and this is alternative way to see the city very easy. I recommend the 3 days pass for $18. You are able to ride the bike for 30 minutes, unlimited times. The down fall is you can only ride a max of 30 min at a time but to us that was not a problem b/c we knew where we were going. Now you can take the bike out and reload and take it out again with out any problem.. great way to get around.. loved it!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/10/2017,"Capital Bike Share? More like Communism Bike Share.Pay attention to the usage charges Best to get the $8 24hr option, even though it's not 24hrs, more like 24 hours 30 min at a time, since they will charge $8 per 30 min regardless of what you do and it will leave you with a hefty bill. The  8 hour is a ripoff since it is not 24hr you have to dock every 30 min, no warnings on if you are coming up on 30 min, only a text after about 2 hours that you went over, by that time they made their money on you, and it takes a half hour just to find an open dock!  All a money making scheme targeting tourist. Boycott Capital Bike Share!!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/04/2016,Looking forward to renting a bike from this brand new bike rental location when they finally manage to install the 15 bikes. Capital Bikeshare chose a good location for this station but they could have have installed it next to the W & OD trail instead.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/23/2017,"Usage FeesTrips under 30 minutes are included in the pass price. If you keep a bike out for 30 minutes or longer at a time, usage fees apply.RIDE LENGTH USAGE FEE*0-29 minutes Included30-59 minutes $260-89 minutes + $490+ minutes + $8 per each additional 30 minutesThe above is copied from the Capital Bikeshare website.Want to rent a bike for 4 hours? - $8 + $2 + $4 + $40 = $54Four of us rented bikes for a tour of the mall and monuments last weekend.  At the kiosk it implies/states that the cost for a 24hr. rental is $8.  Perhaps buried somewhere else are the usage fees.  We were charged $280 for four bikes for the afternoon.Seems like a great way to fleece tourists and leave a lasting impression.1st kiosk had one bike so we tried to rent it but it was broken (if the light blinks yellow and then red after entering the code then the bike cannot be rented).  So we headed to the next station to find bikes.  What we didn't know is that the code expires in 5 mins.  Tried to use the same code at the next station.  No work. When you enter an expired code the dock light blinks yellow then red as if the dock/bike is broken and cannot be rented.  Because the next two stations only had one bike each and each time the light blinked red we figured these single bikes/docks were broken as well.  Off to the third station with plenty of bikes.  Kiosk is not accepting credit cards.  Off to 4th station.  Finally got our bikes and we're on our way.  Little did we know the meter was running."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/04/2017,"We were in town for a 3-day conference last week and knew we had to cram as much fun as possible to make it an awesome trip.  We decided that the Capitol Bikeshare program could help us maneuver town quickly and inexpensively.  A 3-day pass is $17 - perfect!First, READ all of the bits of info on the kiosk. Bikes are checked out in 30-minute increments, and you'll be billed for periods longer than 30 minutes. Returning bikes is as simple as slipping them into a station and ensuring the status light turns green. Sometimes it takes some muscle to get the green light, so don't be shy.Second, plan each trip. We used Google Maps with the bike route function to choose roads that were bike-friendly, and coupled it with the Capitol Bike share map to be sure there was a nearby station with available slots to return our bikes. The map shows how many bikes are at each station, too, so you can be relatively confident that a bike will be waiting for you when you're ready for your next bike. Did it take a few minutes to plan it out? Yep. But we saved SO much time by not walking. Put your phone in your workout arm band and affix the armband to the cord that secures your items in the basket for easy reference.  Third,  these bikes are not your road or fitness hybrid bikes. They're HEAVY. The tires are fat. And the saddle would make Grandma happy. It takes a beat to adapt to the geometry, but these bikes are meant to withstand potholes and anything else that can get in your way.  You have three gears on the right handlebar. Twist the ring to the right of the handlebar to find the appropriate gear. Bells are on the left handlebar. Make noise so cabbies and tour buses stand a chance of hearing you.Fourth, be sure to adjust the seat so you're getting a good, comfy ride. Fifth, bring your helmet - I wish I would have thought to bring mine!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/17/2017,"Metro can be unreliable and its stations too sparse sometimes. Traffic is too horrible for car or rideshare especially near the Mall. Walking is sometimes not a realistic option between two points.The perfect solution? Biking! But not everyone especially visitors has a bike, so Capital Bikeshare solves that problem!This bike-sharing program is seriously the best innovation I've seen in DC! Years ago when I first got to DC, getting around was a hassle, but with Capital Bikeshare, I could explore more on bike during my 2nd time back in DC. With so many bike docks throughout the city, it's usually not a problem finding an available bike unless you are around super-popular point like Lincoln Memorial.If you have at least a day pass, you can use the bike as many times as you want without extra charge as long as you ride for less than 30 minutes each time. Just make sure if you dock your bike properly (wait for the light to turn green) after you're done or else you'll be charged after 30 minutes! Use the Metro or rideshare to cover the extreme distances, but if you are traversing medium to short distance especially throughout the National Mall, I highly recommend using Capital Bikeshare!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,02/14/2018,"I have been a customer for 3 years paying for the yearly option. I found out I was moving to another state soon and emailed to inquire about canceling. Rather than telling me what the policy was, they immediately charged me 64$ (the amount for the rest of the year) and canceled my plan. When I asked them to restart it as I was not moving for two more months and I did not know I would be immediately charged, they said sorry no can do.For being a customer for so long I didn't deserve to be treated like this. With so many other bike share options you would think they would be more willing to work with their customers."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/30/2018,"Worst mistake of renting a bike. We were exhausted from walking and in a sketchy part of town at night, trying to quickly access a bike and didn't realize what we agreed to. We rode to the Lincoln memorial, parked, walked 5 steps away and took a picture and someone rode off on our bikes. On the scooters (that we used all day but we're dead at this time) they had GPS's and you can end your ride immediately if someone takes off on it. We didn't realize the bikes weren't like that (first time using it) and were devastated when they were gone, and read the ""you're responsible for up to $1200 if bike is not returned"" part. Called customer service immediately and the nice lady reassured me if whoever stole them returned them, she would waive the fee. Well, the man I talked to today said he would not be able to do that and was super rude and said ""well I could get my manager to review it but we don't normally waive fees.. but like at least they returned the bike""... yes we're SUPER grateful they returned the bikes... but it was 14hrs later (supposed to turn them in every 30min) so we were charged $94 each for a BIKE that we rode for maybe 20 minutes because we ""abandoned it""... at the time I was frustrated because he was making it seem like I was lying to him about the lady saying she would waive the fee, so I said forget it because he was SO rude. It was a good 20 minutes while it lasted but if you're in DC don't you dare get off that bike at ALL for anything at all or you'll be charged out the butt for a bike that isn't even worth that much money. Rent a scooter, it's cheaper in the long run and has a GPS. The lady in customer service was awesome, but the man who I spoke to today should not be in customer service at all. Such a shame because we enjoyed the bikes but we will not touch one again due to this awful experience."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,02/22/2017,"On Feb 21 at 2:45 pm, I picked up a bicycle in front of my building at 455 Mass Ave and peddled to Metro Center next to Macy's, where I intended to drop-off the bicycle at the Capital Bikeshare bicycle stand and take the Orange line. Unfortunately, there was no empty places to drop-off the bicycle so I drove to the other Capital Bikeshare across the street--no empty places there. So I drove to the Smithsonian Metro where there are two Capital Bikeshare bicycle stands; unfortunately, no place to drop-off my bicycle. I called Capital Bikeshare to explain my problem--I was told to go to Jefferson and 14th street where there are three empty spots. People...Jefferson and 14th street?! There's no metro station there and I'm wanting to get home: the time was now 3:30. I decided that the easiest solution was to drive back to Chinatown where I know there's a bicycle rack and try to get the Red Line--unfortunately, no empty places to drop-off my bicycle either. At 3:45 I found a place to drop-off the bicycle in front of the MLK library. Read the other comments and you will connect the dots and realize that Capital Bikeshare deliberately keep the bicycle racks filled necessitating the user to driver around town looking for an empty rack and paying overtime for the use of the bicycle. Great job Capital Bikeshare!"
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,12/22/2017,"The bikes are serviceable, but often times I would arrive at the Union Station rack and it would be totally full.  This causes many issues for me because I have to catch a very specific train out of DC and I have missed that train on a few occasions due to the bike rack being full.  There should be more oversight of that location due to its importance.  I'm afraid if this continues I will be forced to discontinue my account and find alternate means of transportation within DC."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,03/17/2016,"I've always been hesitant to purchase a bike because: 1) They get stolen in DC all the time, even if you have a decent lock; and 2) I'm too lazy to find one that fits my 4'11'' frame, apart from the occasional Craigslist search. Thus, I've renewed my Capital Bikeshare membership for the past three years because walking long distances gets boring and because the metro is a pain in the butt. Plus, there's something about riding home with the wind in your hair and your purse repeatedly smacking against your side that really makes you feel alive. Is an annual membership worth it? Only if you ride it at least 34 times per year, as this would approximate the amount of metro money you'd save by opting to bike instead ($85 membership divided by $2.50 for an average metro ride). As someone who rides to and from work/bars/gym etc., it's more than worth it. BTW, it's cool to see on your online account how many rides you've taken, where you've taken them, and the mileage. #memories #nostalgiaHowever, Capital Bikeshare's imbalanced bike distribution is the BANE OF MY EXISTENCE. On most days, there are zero bikes available around 9am at the two stations closest to me in the Shaw/Mt. Vernon area, so I have to walk to work instead. Or, there will seem to be a bike available to my utter delight, only for me to discover that it's actually out of service. When I emailed customer service about this, they pleasantly stated that the ""team of Station Rebalancers is working hard to augment the circulation of bikes."" Well, work harder? The station at V and 14th NW is another repeat offender with no docks available much of the time, forcing me to open my Spotcycle app and anxiously look for new stations before I get charged for having a bike for over 30 minutes. The uncertainty of being able to either find a bike or find an open dock when you need it is prompting me to think more deeply about buying my own bike. I wish it weren't a problem because Capital Bikeshare has otherwise been really fun to use - and I don't even mind their clunkiness (c'mon, we're not exactly riding rugged trails over here, so I don't exactly get the complaints about their bulky structure)."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/18/2017,"I've been using this service for almost two years and it seems like a great idea (hence the 2nd star). However, the idea isnt the problem. The company or the people representing it are a fantastic failure. First, the maintenance on the bikes is sub par. You may get a broken bike, you may find a dock that doesn't release any bikes, and sometimes docking your bike doesnt end your trip. On multiple occasions, the docking has shown a green light (success) and then I get an email stating that the bike I've docked is still in use. Once, I had to call and find out myself, as there was no notice. But there is a charge, and IF you call and IF they send someone to check, and IF they notice a problem then they will refund your money. So, my advice is to take a picture of the green light at every dock. (What a pain!).I had a technician watch me take the picture once during a lunch break and asked if there was a problem. I told him why I do that and he smirked and then removed all the bikes from that dock (even the one I just docked and planned to ride back). I then had to walk back.I know customer service in this city is crap, but even the adults at this company seem to get there cues from how an apathetic teenager would do their job. This may be my last subscription to this ""service"". The idea of spending way too much on a bike to have it possibly stolen or vandalized is starting to seem like a better value than Capital Bikeshare."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,02/16/2017,"Easy to use, automated, communal bike sharing service gets five stars all the way!It couldn't be any easier: purchase a membership for $8, first half-hour of bike use is included, then it's $2 for the next half hour, then $6 for every half hour after that, with a maximum lease time of 24 hours per lease.From the moment you walk up to the self-service machine in between the racks of bicycles, the process is very easy to navigate.  Simply select how many bicycles you'd like, how you'd like to pay, then process payment, unlock your bicycle with the code on the receipt, tour, and return.  The best part of it all is that you can return a bicycle to any station with available storage around the city.  I only wish we had one of these in smaller cities, like Reno, Nevada!The only area for critique with these is that the bikes we borrowed had tires that were starting to bald in the center.  I'm not sure who services these or how often they are checked, but it was about time for a new tire on both the bikes my friend and I borrowed.  Unfortunately, these are so popular that there were only three left (out of 20) available and we didn't have much of a selection to choose from.  Other than the balding tire issue, the rest of the bicycle was in great repair!Overall, a great experience with a communal bike sharing program that easily pulls five stars!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/10/2017,"Be very wary of this company.  We thought that it would be a great idea to explore the city on bikes until we checked our bank account.  They lead you to believe that you are renting a bike for $8/day; however, they charge you additional fees if you keep the bike for longer increments of time than 30 minutes.  Two phone representatives confirmed receiving multiple complaints from customers about additional unknown charges but state that they are only able to authorize the return of a portion of the fees charged to my card.  If you ask me, use Uber."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/03/2017,"This company is misleading. I loved the idea of renting bikes in the city until I saw my bank statement. I own a bike but thought it would be fun to rent one and explore. I picked the 24 hour bike rental several times. What I didn't know is that they will charge you every 30 min if you don't return the bike. You have to return every 30 min at the bus rental station and then enter your code again to take the bike back out.No one has time to read the 100 page outline and half the time the screens don't work properly. Misleading and very inconvenient. There are bike trails that don't have stations close by. This will be the last time I rent one through them. I suggest you invest in your own bike, it's cheaper."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/07/2016,"Completely unfair billing setup. Had to cancel my membership due to being relocated. Because i was ""outside of the 30 day renewal period"" i was charged for an entire year of service that i will never be able to use! Also, never knew that i was set to automatically renew once my initial term was over and had i known i would've opted out. This should be more clear along with your cancellation policies.  In such a transient city such as DC, how can you expect people to pay for a year when they are relocated? In addition, both bikes and docks are never there when you need them or the docks go for long periods of time without being fixed. Not a yelp reviewer typically but couldn't hold my tongue on this one. SCAM!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/17/2016,"What a scam!!!! Last Saturday I rented a capital bikeshare bike with the 24 hours hold ($8) to don't worry about 30 minutes return policy, even when I only needed the bike for two hours maximum. When I was ready to return it, three stations were completely full and I had to wait for 30 minutes to return the bike. I called the office to let them know that someone should come and pick up some bikes from several locations in Georgetown since there were like 15 people waiting to return the bikes, but of course no one picked up.Today Monday, I checked my bank account and I was charged another $14 on top of the $8. When I called to inquired about this charge, a very annoyed customer service agent (Ashley) told me that I need to return the bike every 30 minutes regardless of the 24-hours rental or I will get charge. Absolute false advertisement and the worst customer service. Will never rent a bike from  them again and I hope that you do the same."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/07/2017,"Docking stations often full, bikes are inconsistent in quality, and their customer service is pretty abysmal.. It's a nice service to have in theory but I regret my yearly membership. Not worth it. Definitely wouldn't depend on it as a primary mean of transportation. I have been late numerous times due to this issues with this service."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/10/2017,If you live near Lincoln park on Capitol Hill don't bother joining. There are never bikes there when you need them. Just buy your own bike and a good lock.

DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/24/2016,"I live in DC and please be aware that this bike share may cost you more than you actually intended if you don't know how to navigate the city well. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT capital bike share is an ""on the go"" service but note that you are to return the bike every 30 minutes or else you will be charged absurd fees. HERE'S THE CATCH. This is not a great option for tourist because you are not aware of the area so it will be a challenge for you to find a bike station to return the bike before extra fees. If you are having ANY issues with charges, don't expect customer service to make the right call. I am very disappointed, as I have used the bikeshare many many times, and unfortunately this will be my last.I wanted to inform others so they don't lose out on anymoney"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/16/2016,"Don't do it! They are not effective at balancing where the bike stations are full, so you end up near your destination with no way to turn in your bike. We rented as a scenic way to ride to the Mall near the Holocaust Museum. It was a hot summer day and when we got there we couldn't get rid of our bikes.  So we went to the next closest.  Full. It's a bad feeling when you have to drop your bike and take a taxi back to your destination.        Also, the web page map is impossible to navigate on an iphone.  It was useless for finding bike stations.         There are technology solutions to these issues and Capital Bike share should invest in them."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/01/2018,"What they don't tell you on their website or without making you scroll through LITERALLY 67 screens on a freaking kiosk is that if you don't redock every 30 minutes, they charge you ""overages"". My niece and I paid for a 24 hour membership on bikes and used 45 minutes. We were charged $16 together and while pricey, it was fair for 24 hours. However, a few days later I saw a charge for $4.00 on my account. I called my bank first and disputed it then I called them. They explained that it was because they are a ""bikeshare"" and are used for short trips. Now, the station was so full of bikes when we returned that we literally had to wait for someone to rent a bike so that we could redock ours. This is ridiculous because it's not written in plain English anywhere that you can easily access or. It's buried in 67 screens on a kiosk (who's going to read that?) and doesn't appear anywhere on their site. I looked very thoroughly. It's a rip off to say the least, but if you want to rent a bike to sightsee, keep in mind where the stations are and be sure to redock every 30 mins!!!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/12/2016,"Avoid using Capital Bikeshare if you plan to take a ride longer than 30 minutes. I was visiting DC for the first time and wanted to visit the some different spots (White House, Embassies, National Mall, etc). I figured the 24 hour pass for 8 dollars would be the safest bet instead of paying hourly, but man did I get screwed. I saw a 54 dollar charge on my account and called their customer service number. I am told I have to check the bike in every 30 minutes otherwise more usage fees get charged to my transactions. I had the bike between 4-5 hours so the fees added up. Of course no one is going to read the 130 page user agreement on a kiosk in the sun when you can hardly read the screen.24 hour access as long as you dock it every 30 minutes.. The kiosk doesnt give any emphasis about this. Know what you're getting yourself into.  I understand how its helpful for residents, but I find it distasteful how easy it is for this company to scam tourists."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/19/2016,"AVOID AT ALL COST IF YOU VALUE YOUR BENJAMINS!  CBS charged me $30 on top of the $2 membership fee after I took a trip from the White House to 22nd & P. They claimed that I took a 3 hour bike trip.Why would I take 3 hour bike trip in a business suit/in the middle of summer/with humidity/during rush hour? What do you think I'm f* insane?? From the White House to 22nd & P is a 11 minute trip MAX. I tried to reconcile this mistake with their customer service department and even sent them a picture of my receipt. I always get my receipt after I return a CBS bike. CBS responded ""because you're a first time user ... We will credit you $15."" Well, CBS...(1) I'm not a first time user. I use the bikes all the time. But, now I won't any more! (2) I don't want your charity. Give me my money! They haven't responded. So, I decided to report this as fraud to my credit card. Because it is...and I have my receipt to prove it."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/27/2016,"The locations of the bike stations are good and it's a good concept, but DO NOT sign up long-term. You're supposed to get the key within 7 days of signing up, but it's been 16 days now, and I still don't have a key. Plus, the touch-screen at the bike stations doesn't work half the time, and the kiosk didn't recognise my credit card. So after paying for a 30 day membership, I haven't been able to use it, and it's already 16 days in. Local management has said they have no explanation and can't do anything. The concept is great, execution is terrible. Bikeshare works in so many other cities, I don't know why the DC centre has to be so terrible at this."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/07/2016,"****THIS IS A MISLEADING COMPANY WITH EXTREME HIDDEN FEES!!****We went and got bikes from downtown around the monuments(I'll get back to this). The options they give you sort of force you to buy he 24 pass, assuming this will be cheaper. That is not the case. 2 -24 hour passes cost $16 with the first 30 minutes supposedly free. They have a small gray and black pixel screen reminiscent to a 90's game boy, which is difficult to read on their small screen in the blaring sunlight. We rode around for 3 hours, no problem. Docked the bikes back when we were ready to go. 2 days later we see 2 separate charges- one for the $16, and one for $76. Imagine my confusion! When called they said, and I quote, ""The bikes are supposed to be docked every 30 minutes and are not really for tourist use."" Well why put them in high tourist areas? Why not explicitly state that they need to be docked every 30 minutes? Why hide your hidden fees within 133 pages of terms and conditions on a screen smaller then my phone? They were not willing to do a refund of any kind, poor customer service Being from out of town this put a huge hold on my trip and the people I had accompanied with me. Save your money. This company isn't worth the time or headache you'll have after having dealt with them....."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,04/18/2017,"It was okayPros: good to have a bike and not overpricedCon:Im 4'10"" and was not tall enough for the bike even with the seat at its lowest so that every time we had to stop i needed to jump off of it. I think going to a bike rental place would have been better if youre short so you can choose the right size bikeFinding dock stations was a pain. Then when you find a docking station and there isnt room to dock your bike you need to look for another dock station which is super inconvenient. Downloading the app works but you have to keep checking it and sometimes even though it says there are 2 bikes available or two open docks available it is wrong because the sensor is broken. Happened only once but it was really inconvenient. Next time i will rent a bike for the size factor and the convenience of being able to lock it next to a post near by my destination."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/20/2017,"WARNING - D.C. Tourist Trap....  unless you dock the bike EVERY 30 minutes, which is pretty much impossible, you will be charged $22 additional dollars over and above the Day Pass of $8. Better to ride Uber. It will cost you less. I used the bike for 3 hours."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,07/08/2016,"I think many new people don't understand how the bike share thing works. My wife and myself found this out while we were in Colorado one year. We thought we could keep the bike for 24 hours but luckily we returned the bike. I found out later that you need to return the bikes within 30 mins so as to not get charged. These bikes are the same way. I just understand that customer services is probably problematic.  I would hope that customer service improves but you get what you pay for and these people probably don't get paid much to hear our daily problems.So keep this in mind when using these bikes:1. You need to buy an ""access key"" which can range from 1 to 3 days access. It's like a virtual key (the machine will give u a code).2. Have your payment method (credit card) with you whenever you need to get a bike. If you have a 3-day ""virtual access key"" I think you might need it to get a new code each time you access the bike. The codes are only good for a limited amount of time (which is good if you lose the code or drop it, no one else can use it).3. Map out where you're going so you can plan to return your bike within 30 minutes. There are hundreds of the bike share stalls around DC area. Look for one that's on your way to wherever you're planning to go.4. A way to get around having to pay the hourly fee is to plan your trip so you can hit a biking stall before you get to a monument, return your bike (babysit the bike), and then immediately have your significant other get a new access code and ride off (it starts the 30-min cycle all over again). Just make sure the bike is fully secure when you return the bike like this. * whenever we returned the bike we always made sure the bike was firmly secured and returned. Give it a couple of hard pulls to double check the bikes locked-in because the system doesn't really give you a receipt of return.  I would hate for someone to steal your bike with no proof of return."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/29/2015,"As a daily Capital Bikeshare user, commuting to my job on a bike happily, you would expect me to be more generous with my stars.  But my happy has more to do with biking itself than with the merits of Capital Bikeshare. Yes, I love communing with nature and the open sky, not being subject to the consistently breaking down and overcrowded DC metro system or unpredictable road traffic. I love riding one-way with the option of returning using another mode of transportation-- for example in case of thunderstorms, plain-old sick DC humidity, or other weather issues. I also like not having to worry about maintenance-- no more late mornings because I had to pump my tires at the last minute!  Yet, Capital Bikeshare sure is a drag.  My main issue is not with the tank-like bikes (three gears only and heavy, but functional) but with the system.The Bikeshare system was bought second hand from a Canadian city. Yes, the capital of the most powerful nation in the world could not actually pull together a modern system designed just for it. That's why the kiosks at the bike stands seem like IBM DOS-based machines from the 80s, you know black and white with blinking text. If you happen to hit sun glare on the screen, good luck figuring out what it says.  The kiosks often become a problem because the touch-sensitive function is antiquated.  If you want to return a bike when the racks are full, you have to navigate the screen to get the free extra 15 minutes of loan. This system requires you to punch in a keycode from your membership key...no easy feat given the touch screen; it functions poorly and seems like its on a delay. In an age where you can use a smartcard even on DC's old metro system and swipe entry badges against sensors everywhere, this is an unpleasant experience.I question the convenience of these loaner bikes at crunch time, when I intend to dock a bike and make an appointment, but the bikestands are full. This happens fairly regularly to me, be warned.  So you have to build in extra time to ride to the next available open bike stand...and navigate the aforementioned kiosk screens.Frequently I have had to call in (and have observed others doing the same) because of problems and not being able to use the kiosks to address an issue. It takes a good 15-20 minutes of explanation with the robotic customer service people, in loud traffic when you can barely hear....and it does lead you to wonder if you could have saved time by using metro...(likely yes!)The pricing system would be incredibly intimidating to me if I didn't have the annual membership.  It's a $100 deposit, and then a tiered system of charges based on how long you keep a bike.  Gazonkers! Their computer system is often not synched up with the bike stands.  So the kiosk may tell you there are three open slots, but actually those stands themselves may be broken and incapable of securely locking a bike.  Maintenance is pretty good but when the system is old anyway, you have more incidents of improperly-working bike parking stands (not the bikes themselves).Beware the stands themselves may appear to lock the bike but they actually don't.  Often you hear the whirring noise of a motor and walk off assuming the locks work when it may not...and you'll find out later when you get your credit card statement. Just wait till you see the green light before walking away, even if you are distracted and in a hurry.The SPOTCYCLE app for smartphones seems to work great, and helps with finding bikes.In general I am glad we have a Bikeshare system. I just think the system infrastructure is tedious, and desperately needs to be upgraded."

Not worth it. I'll save my $2 and buy my own bike.
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/26/2017,"This is the best way to see all the sites in DC. Plenty of bikes and stations. Pay attention to the wording though, as many others have mentioned. You get unlimited 30 minute rides but you have to dock the bike before 30 minutes to avoid extra charges. Just dock the bike and remove it right back out to avoid the charges. Overall $8 for 24 hours of use isn't bad at all."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/21/2017,"Very disappointed to see all the one-star reviews, which seem to have been left by people who didn't understand the pricing structure of Bikeshare, which is pretty common anywhere Bikeshare exists. If this is your first time using Bikeshare, here or in another city, please take some time to understand how you will be charged. These bikes are designed to be used for short trips. In DC, you can ""daisy-chain"" short trips together, docking the bike and then taking it out again, to avoid high charges.Capital Bikeshare is one of Washington, D.C.'s gems. I own my own bike, and I'm also an annual member. It's great for getting to appointments in the middle of the day when I don't have my own bike, or when I want to ride one way, but not necessarily the other. The bikes are very stable, and  generally well-maintained, and the companion app (Spotcycle) is super helpful."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/14/2016,I have used bike share for years but lately maintenance of docking stations has really been very poor.

Update:changing my review to one star since I see that Capitol City Bikeshare has not even bothered to respond! For a company that relies on local support this is very disappointing. After using it since their inception I do not think I will be renewing my annual membership when it expires.

But BEWARE: after charging our separate cards the $8 for 24 hours, several of the next stations were not working properly to read my husbands amex card. So really it was worthless and pain. After email to them, they refused to issue any kind of partial refund since we didn't call the phone number when we were having the problems.  Calling is the last thing you want to do in D.C.

They had no problem ignoring my mail for days until I followed up and then dropped a quick ban hammer in minutes after the second request. Hey I don't like that answer and want someone else to tell me whats up? Wrong, no supervisor for me, they'll just make the poor kid who grabbed me from the queue tell me the supervisor has no balls and can't be bothered to reach out.I'm not an idiot, I was able to read their greyscale pixel screens in the glaring sunshine to understand the pricing structure so I'm not bitching about that, but rather the fact that they double dipped on two of my cards after the machine malfunctioned. Process can not be completed at this time my ass. Sure it's only 16$ at the end of the day but as a local member of Hubway, also owned by the same parent company its more than that.

DC,2,Negative,Yelp,02/05/2015,"I am giving this review from the perspective of an Alexandria resident and not a tourist or D.C. Cycling Caesar. I also realize that for tourist and D.C. environmentalists bikeshare may be the only way to travel. I often look at these red monstrosities and images of AL Gore and Gisele tooling through the streets of D.C. while Robert Redford chants a mantra for the XL pipeline's demise flash through my mind. Yes, thousands of eager tourist flow to these babies with smiles for miles Well, bully for them, but  for the rest of us, there is a sad reality to all this cycling progress. Yup, this may be how they do it in Amsterdam but the Dutch know how to ride a bike, which is something many American tourist seem to have forgotten. ""Hello, Walking here, Speed Racer."" And if some eager tourist doesn't turn you into a bicycle road pizza, there is the major annoyance of loosing primo parking spaces to Capital Bikeshare's bike stands. Anyone who has ever had to hunt for a spot in Old Town understands just how frustrating it can be to see this biking hoard use eminent domain to claim parking spots that are sorely needed in Old Town. So maybe every time someone rents a bikeshare an environmentalist gets a windmill, but for those  of us who still like to cruise down the road with Detroit steel under our rumps, the bikeshare stands are tantamount to automotive claim-jumping.  ,"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/27/2017,"HORRIBLE customer service. Everything is fine with Cap Bikeshare unless you get a bike or a dock that goes bad. If that happens outside of daylight hours they do not support you the customer at all. If it happens during the day, you're still screwed, because you'll have to wait for a technician to come take the bike from you instead of getting to work or wherever you're in a hurry to get to. Even then, there is no way to stop the rental if the lock is broken, and GET THIS: they don't guarantee they will refund you for the extra time even though it was out of your control. Instead, they send the case up for review/investigation because, after all, you must be doing something wrong.What happened to me: Grabbed the last bike out of Union Station with a very bad sounding lock on a Monday night after a late day at the office. Put it away at a station across from my house with another bad grinding sound, and a red light. I tested the bike and it was stuck in the dock, so I figured the red light meant it was now out of service, and I hurried off to let the dog out before he lost control. Turns out, somewhere in the 130 pages of fine print I'm supposed to have read that the bike releases again after 10 seconds and I'm supposed to call them and.. stay there with it?Got that email a couple hours later as I was climbing into bed, called, and learned that my rental was still running. Completely at their mercy now with a running rental, they pulled me out of bed on a Monday night to go stand in the rain and try over and over again to dock a broken bike.  When it (surprise) didn't work, they wanted me to ride around to another station a half mile away at 11pm in my PJ's, because their policy says that a bike has to be tried at two docks to show that it can't lock. WTH?! At first I thought they were joking.Of course it didn't work there either, and now I'm stuck with a bikeshare bike in my basement until a tech can pick it up (tomorrow).. WITH THE RENTAL STILL RUNNING! Thank God at least I have a place to put it. What would I have done if I were a tourist on my way to the airport with nowhere to put this thing?I was a frequent rider (142 trips in 5 winter months), and I'm sad to say that after tonight, I'm closing my account. What they put me through was utter and total disrespect. They treated and spoke to me like a criminal, abused my time, and disregarded my customer loyalty, all in the name of an idiotic policy."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/10/2016,While there could be room for improvement for novice users this is the best way to cover a lot of ground while touring DC.  Walking the 10 miles we rode would have been a lot harder.  No problem on getting bikes on a July Saturday.  Played the system to keep switching bikes every thirty minutes and all riding was free.  At the commuter store the lady gave us a code for a free 24 hour membership.  The app was helpful to find to docking stations which were close enough to what we needed.  Try it!
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/27/2017,"Just like most things in Washington DC, even the bike system is corrupt. It clearly says $2 for 30 min or $8 per day. We got it for the whole day thinking we wouldn't have to worry with returning it so often. We're charged an extra $38 for not returning it every 30 min. It's so ridiculous.

We only went over on our 30 min ride segment one time due to full bike kiosks during the Folk Life Festival. We still managed to find an empty slot a block away. We found that ample bikes were available and after a few days could strategize the times of day to find bikes or slots available near our apartment and sites. We utilized bike routes and paths and lanes with ease. Drivers were VERY courteous and generous with us on busy crowded streets.  A great experience all around! We recommend it!!!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/10/2017,"We purchased the 24-hour day pass for $8 and we rode for about two hours. We loved our bike ride in the city. However, checked our bank account and they had charged us $92!! Very inconvenient that they hid the fact that you can only ride a bike in 30 minute increments. I am so disappointed with this bike company. It's definitely a scam to try and get more money out of bikers because its hidden so deeply in the fine print. NEVER AGAIN! You'd think after all of the complaints and refunds they would have changed something by now...but no, this company is just dirty."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/05/2017,"Horrible customer service. When bike stations do not work they will offer you a promo code for a free day pass. However, that code will NOT work and they will have no record of your call to customer service and they will plainly call you a liar! Two Thumbs down!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/06/2016,"Excuse me while I gush about Bikeshare. The $85 annual option is a steal. You break even if you replace 49 bus trips with bike trips. I've had my occasional frustrations, but it's excellent overall. I commute to and from work every day with bikeshare. Pro-tip: Phone customer service is awful, but the twitter team is awesome. Also, wear a helmet."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/17/2017,This service has some serious problems and I wouldn't recommend using at all. I've had for a week and already have had two big issues. 1. The app that tells you how many bikes and open slots are at a station isn't always correct. The other day the app said there were a few spots open and when I got there they were all full. I checked the app again and it still said there were spots open when clearly there weren't. How does Capital Bikeshare handle this? You have to go bike to another station until you find an open slot. If you don't you get hit with fees. Horribly inconvenient way to fix their own mistake.2. I tried docking my bike today and the slot wouldn't register it. I tried several other slots at that station and none of them worked. I called customer service (by the way the dialing system makes you repeat everything unnecessarily) and explained the situation and basically got 'there's nothing I can do. Try a different station.' I did that and it still didn't work. Now I'm getting hit with fees while they send out a technician. The customer service rep could not give me an ETA on when the technician would arrive. She said if I left and the bike was stolen than I would get hit with a way bigger fee. Very disappointed with the overall experience and customer service. I guess that's why it's so cheap.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/25/2017,Terrible customer service that scams customers out of money. Good luck trying to get a refund out of the company if somehow the bike doesn't properly register when it's re-docked. They're completely unresponsive and very unhelpful when finally reached on the phone. I will never use Bikeshare again.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/29/2017,"DO NOT USE CAPITAL BIKESHARE-HIDDEN USAGE FEES-SHAM-  I was charged an extra $108 for 2 bikes a  24 Hour Day pass.  The ""24-Hour Rental Pass"" does not in fact mean that you can rent the bike for 24 hours...it actually means you have unlimited 30 minute trips for 24 hours and you have to dock your bike at a station every 30 minutes in order to not be charged EXTRA USAGE FEES. That is a joke of a business model.  They purposely do not make this clear in their branding and instruction wording at all so customers continue to rent the bikes longer than 30 minutes setting you up to fail from the beginning. Customer service is also terrible they blame you for not reading the fine print and not interpreting it correctly and only refer back to the contract on the tiny little screen of the kiosk. They do not refund your money and clearly don't care about keeping you as a return customer."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/25/2017,"I am an avid Biker in DC and my friend visited this weekend and bought a Capital Bikeshare Day Pass. We docked it every 30 minutes like is required and she was charged $94. Apparently although it clicked when she docked it at the end of the day, the light didn't go on. The bike was not damaged or stolen, however it did not register as docked until 11 hours later. When I called customer service they said it didn't matter that it was clearly a mistake and that the best they could do was a 50% refund - charging her $50. I wanted to let everyone know so they can be careful if they have a friend visiting or seek other options like Bike and Roll (haven't used them myself, but will next time).To top it off when I tried calling and asked to speak to a manager for her (she didn't remember where we docked it, etc.) they put me on hold for ten minutes then hung up, and they told my friend she had to accept the 50% and would not allow her to call back. As a big supporter of Bike shares I was extremely disappointed with this awful customer service and hope to see improvements in the future.I'd like to add that I had to speak with Indiego in Philly regarding an incorrect overage charge and they were helpful and friendly, and refunded the charge with no issue. This is not a problem with Bikeshares generally or the 30-min docking rule."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/01/2014,"I'e been visiting DC for the last three years and have always eyed Bikeshare but never used it -- until this last Saturday -- thanks to my son who told me that's what we were going to do.  Turns out I'm glad he was insistent.After figuring our way through the instructions, it was pretty easy.  One one-day membership and two bikes, print out the code to unlock the bikes, adjust the seat and off we went.  The bikes are in excellent condition, three gears, tiny little basket thingie in front. (Too small if you're going shopping.)There's no additional charge for the first 30 minutes.  So we changed bikes as we toured the monuments.  Change 1 at Jefferson Memorial, change 2 at Lincoln, change 3 at 18th & Penn. So far so good.Change 4?  No bikes!!!!  The first stand and every stand we walked by between 17th + Penn and Dupont Circle was empty!!!Change 5. Dupont Circle and then back to the hotel at 21st and Penn.At each stop we took our time. We didn't just shift out the bikes, although you could I suppose.So why four stars and not five?1.  No bikes on mid-afternoon Saturday when we weren't done with our day.2. The bike stations (?) are actually hard to see when you're riding the bike.  You know they're in the area but on which corner or side street? A flag or sign you can see above the parked cars would help.3.  No bikes.I like the way this concept has caught on.  I was in DC four days and saw loads of people riding those red Bike share bikes everywhere I went.  What a great idea."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/30/2017,"Convenient but...deceptive. Be very careful with 24 hour passes! As many of the other reviewers mentioned, the 24-hour pass is essentially a scam. Despite what they say when you try to dispute extra charges, it is not made clear upon purchase that for the 24-hour pass, you must dock and undock a bike every 30 minutes. A three-hour ride using a 24 hour pass ended up costing me $46, as opposed to the $8 advertised. I am the type of person who tends to read all of the fine print, and it is rare that I miss such details. The clause was buried in a ""safety waiver"". The terms for additional fees are not made clear at all, and customer service condescendingly refuses to correct disputed charges. If you opt for a day pass, set a timer for yourself or download the app to make sure that you re-dock after every 30 minutes of riding so you don't get nabbed. What's the point of getting a day pass if with so many restrictions it's not totally a day pass?"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/17/2017,DO NOT USE CAPITAL BIKESHARE.  This company is predatory.  Rent a bike for reasonable fee of $4.00 - return it thinking everything worked properly - then get a $156.00 charge on your credit card in the middle of the night. My group rented 8 bikes and used 3 different credit cards.  We all returned the bikes at the same time to the same location.  I'm confident we all docked them properly.  At midnight I got a notification of a $156 charge on each card.  The company customer service reps have obviously gotten my kind of complaint thousands of times.  They have stock answers explaining how the customer either kept the bike out too long or failed to dock it properly.  They finish by offering a 50% refund.  I think the whole thing is a scam.  It's hard for me to believe that 3 of the people in my group of 8 didn't dock properly.  It's even harder for me to believe that each of those 3 people happened to be on different credit cards.  Add to that the fact that we returned the bikes to a station in a residential neighborhood late in the evening where no one would have found undocked bikes - especially not 3 of them.  The only explanation is that this company makes a lot of money slamming unsuspecting users with this fee.  Even when they offer to refund 50% they're still stealing $78.00 from every person they do this to.  Pretty good racket Bikeshare - your victims are usually tourists who leave and can't fight back.  DO NOT USE CAPITAL BIKESHARE.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/29/2017,"Scam, scam, scam.  If you expect customers to dock every 30 minutes, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to prey upon tourists by leaving a station near the beginning of the monuments tour without any other docks within a reasonable distance nearby."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/25/2017,"We live in DC...my son's bike was broken, so I suggested using Capital Bikeshare because it is close to our house.  What a RIP OFF!!!!!  He got the $8, 24 hour pass.  Little did we know that unless you dock the bike EVERY 30 MINUTES (FREAKING UNREALISTIC/RIDICULOUS), you get slammed with charges.  A few hour ride turned into $78!!!!!!!  What a SCAM!!!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/15/2017,"A lot of people complain about the 30 minute thing but in their defense they post that everywhere when renting a bike that's not the issue. I have a year membership and the real issue is there's never any open bikes in D.C. Proper especially in the Columbia heights area.... With that being said, it is a good company. Every time I call in about an issue their customer service is amazing and my issue is resolved quickly. They have great employees even if there are logistical issues."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/06/2016,"If you live in dc, get a capital bikeshare. It's so little per year that you pretty much make the difference up right away. You get exercise, you don't need to look after the bike (just check it in and check it out) and there are so many stations that they're never too far to walk from. I started using CB to get to work and back everyday since if I wanted to go to an impromptu happy hour I could just go and didn't need to worry about the metro or looking after a car or bike. I biked to work year round (thermal pants help a lot during winter) and it was one of my favorite parts of living in DC. The only downside are 1) if it rains you will get soaked and 2) sometimes it's hard to find a bike or return a bike right at 5pm or 8am depending on where you live/where the major commuters are going.Seriously if you're hesitant just get a yearly membership (it was $75 when I was there in 2015). You'll really get to know the city better and save a lot of money on transportation (if your trip is less than 30 min it's free and you can always check in the bike and check it back out again). My only regret with CB is that I didn't get a membership earlier."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/02/2016,"While the concept is good the hidden fees and the fact that you need to return it every 30 minutes is hard to swing for a tourist who doesn't know the city well. Additionally, if you finally find a bike spot and it's full you are charged for something you can't even control and you are charged A LOT. You might as well take a taxi. They need to redo their contracts/policy to adapt to this problem. Or put up a lot more docks compared to bikes in order to prevent people from getting constantly charged for something that is out of their hands. I would recommend an hour stretch versus 30 minutes. It's just not enough time to tour or travel the city well and find a docking station that is open in time. Also, their customer service could use some major changes/new blood. The current staff is neither helpful nor very courteous."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/05/2017,"There are definitely a lot of self-centered idiots who don't read directions or like to follow their own rules when using this service.  Capital Bikeshare is a godsend.  I've had it for three years and have seriously saved hundreds of dollars and ridden countless times.  My list on dockings is several pages long.Tourists!  You only get a half hour to redock for free.  If it's full, re-insert your credit card and get a new code.  You get an extra fifteen minutes to find another station.  Also, yes!  Docks will be full at certain times due to traffic patterns.  You will have to find a new dock and sometimes have to walk a few blocks to your destination.  The horror!Homies who are complaining!  Follow the rules and suck it up if you have to walk a little bit.  And if you are afraid of it getting stolen, always dock it.  Make sure the green light goes on, then lift up the back seat to make sure it's securely docked.Finally, I had one bad experience with them.  I accidentally pulled a bike with a flat tire and it wouldn't redock at any station.  It was 4 in the morning and I left a message with the help desk and I went to sleep.  I forgot to call back to check to make sure the problem was resolved.  They charged me $75.  I then made my case that if they check my records, the bike had a flat tire.  They charged me $35 instead.  I was fuming like a lot of complainers on here and thought about writing a scathing review, but I'm glad I held back.It's an awesome service that will save you hundreds if you just follow the rules."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/19/2016,We loved using the Bikeshare. We liked always having access to bikes. It made it easier to get around from place to place. One of the tricky things with Washington D.C. Is that it is so spread out. It's hard to get to everything. The Bikeshare allowed us to see everything quickly and with little hassle. Our only complaint would be that many of the stations have old touch screens on them. Some of the touch screens don't work very well. They need to be updated to something better or more durable.
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,05/23/2015,"This is a really nice way to get around DC without wasting so much time and energy on walking everywhere. The stations are fairly conveniently located around town and the process wasn't too hard to figure out. I used it twice and both bikes seemed to be in good condition. I appreciate the little storage thing in the front that fit my purse perfectly, and the bell is nice for politely telling people to get out of the way.I researched this a little bit online before I took my first bike, so I was aware that I had to dock it within 30 minutes to avoid the surcharges. I don't remember it being blatantly obvious at the kiosk, but the policy is pretty clearly stated on their website and we live in the age of smartphones, so I don't fault the company for their pricing strategy. It might be a logistical nightmare, but if there's any way it's possible to rent helmets (I'd even be willing to pay a fee), this would be a good option for safety-conscious tourists like me who don't think to pack one and don't really want to buy one just for a day or two. Also, I like that the map on the website tells you how full or empty a rack is, but looking up the map on my Android phone was kind of a pain. Maybe having an app would help remedy that."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/19/2014,"It was worth 4 stars untilI checked my bank account and they overcharged me by $108 dollars, the customer service lady was French and rude and wouldn't hand me over to a manager. not to mention they put a $100 hold on your account per bike. I'm still waiting for that to get credited back. But being overcharged for false advertisement is worth calling the company to complain and then calling my bank to report fraud. these bikes are a rip off, it's not 24 hours for $7 so tourist beware!!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/27/2015,"Bikeshare has been a serious boon for me. I don't own a bike, but it has helped me get to work, to church, to friends' homes, and go on an occasional fun visit to the Cat Cafe in Georgetown. The bikes are workhorses, a bit heavy but they get you around, and for trips of only a few miles, they are pretty comfortable.  They also fit my purse and/or backpack in the front basket/cart.  In fact, one time I strapped a small cooking pumpkin in the front after visiting the farmers market. The lights are a lifesaver since I'm not always sure whether it will be dark when I'm riding home.  As they have expanded their racks, it has improved even more.Tip: I advise getting the Spotcycle app to see where bikes/open docks are available. It is pretty accurate and quite up-to-date."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/12/2017,"IMPORTANT WARNING... YOU MUST DOCK YOUR BIKE EVERY 30 MINUTES OR YOU WILL BE CHARGED EXTRA EVEN IF YOU HAVE A 24 HOUR PASS! I thought this was a fun and reasonably priced way to see the monuments around Washington DC with my 2 kids but once I got home I found I had be charge an extra $114 all because we didn't know we had to dock the bikes every 30 minutes. I've never used this service before and it's not clearly stated for a newbie that even if you have a 24 hour pass you can only have a bike out for 30 minutes at a time. I thought that with a 24 hour pass I didn't have to monitor my trip time. So when I thought I was paying $24 for 3 bikes for a 3 hour ride, I ended up paying a total of $138. An Uber would have been cheaper! This review is a warning to anyone new thinking of using this service so you don't get trapped like I did."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/09/2014,"Agree with a lot of the reviews below: Great for tourists, not for commuting. Also lots of convenient locations, especially close to Metros and sights. Best to use with an app, but not neccessary  A note: you pay for convenience, the hourly rate is kind of pricy, I believe it's somewhere like $7 for the day, then $6ish per 30 min. If you're going to bike all day, this is not a great option. Instead, rent a bike from a shop for the day. This is good for biking in spurts throughout the day. Suggestions: biking around the Mall and monuments, definitely a time saver! Sizing: all the bikes look the same size and are good for teens to adults. I am 5' 2"" and had no problem lowering the bike seat. May be a bit difficult under 5' and over 6' 3"" or so would be my guess."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/14/2016,"This company is misleading. Don't rent from them. There are a lot of hidden fees. On top of it all, their customer service is extremely rude."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/30/2017,Amazing experience touring he capital on bikes.  They worked great! Kids loved them.  I didn't completely read the fees portion so I messed up regarding the 30 min return policy!  I contacted the customer service to better understand the fees and they were extremely helpful.  I would definitely recommend to family and friends.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/26/2017,"We were visiting from California for a long sight-seeing weekend with our young teen-age boys....so looking to optimize the Mall experience and not intent on penny-pinching.  Capital Bikeshare was one of THE BEST parts of our trip.  Super easy to use, bikes were sturdy and resilient, and it was worth every penny to be pedaling to all the monuments and museums rather than wasting time on foot.  Of course we would have loved to walk if we had all the time in the world, but we didn't.   NOTE:  only two bikes are allowed per credit card, so plan ahead if you're a bigger family/group."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,04/10/2017,"Most of the time this service works efficiently but increasingly bike stations will not have any bikes available and anywhere from one to three bikes that need repair. Alternatively you will try to return a bike to a station with multiple slots free, but there is a glitch in the system.  I get the impression that no one is driving the train. Are any progressive city politicians paying attention to this. Get some better management."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/20/2015,"First lets start off that people need to understand how this system works.  Most of the complaints here are because they do not read or understand how the bikeshare works.  Do people really think they are getting a bike for $8.00 a day and that is it?  It is a membership and if you go over 30 minutes without checking in the bike there will be extra charges.Do keep in mind there will be bike stations that have no bikes or there are no docks.  There will be bike that do not work and docks that are broken.You want to make sure if you are riding and pass a bike station to check the bike in,.  You can not be sure your destination station will have empty slots.  You can get 15 minutes extra time if there is no slots to drop the bike.  However you need to know where the next station is.  That may also be full.  There are maps of the locations at the stations but there is no place at the station that you can check the status.  There are apps available for cell phones but they are not that reliable.  They are not always up to date or the app does not work.  The Capital Bikeshare app it has for itself never worked.  Try Spotcycle or others.We had two bikes and rode about 15 miles over the two days and 2 1/2 hours hours of use,  It was easy to check in the bike and get the same bike out again.  There we a few spots there were no empty slots.  What we did if there was only one slot was to check in one bike, get it out again and check in the other bike and get that out again.  That we we got another 30 minutes until we could find an open station.  One time we had to go to 3 stations before we could return both bikes together.  One time we had to check-in and leave one bike and then go drop the the other bike at the coral bike station at 13th and New York Ave then walk backKeep in mind commuters ride the bikes to downtown to work and take them back near their home.  We found walking and riding around that most of the bike stations where full around the downtown area and the museums.during the day with people waiting for an empty slot to open up.We used the bike system for 2 days and had a day key card for convenience.  We could have got a day membership or 3 day membership but then you have to use a code each time.  There is also the question of the deposit charged for each bike.  I never got a clear answer from customer service on this.  We were not charged a deposit with the day key card.There is also a problem with Capital Bikeshare answering e-mails.  They don't respond.  Not once did they respond to any e-mails I sent in weeks prior to the trip.  I ended up calling most times.. I also brought it to there attention of the negative reviews here and other sites that they should address.  They did not seem to care.Still we wanted to give this a try.  It worked out fine even with the hassle of finding a open bike station to drop a bike.  The bikes are nice and study and easy to use.Give it a try but know how it works!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/22/2017,I love the red bikes around D.C. Its very affordable and convenient for everyone. Will definitely rent again when I go back. It made my trip more exciting and saved a lot of time. I don't have to walk everywhere note. It's a must have in your to do list while down in D.C. Only thing I wish it was different was if I was able to rent more than two bikes at a time with the same Card.
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/29/2015,"The the bikes themselves are great. They are easily adjustable, have sufficient safety equipment like front and rear lights, and are comfortable enough.However, the system which includes the rental terminal is an absolute nightmare to use! The touch screen is so unresponsive it took me over 10 minutes to rent a bike."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,12/19/2014,"It's a very ""you get what you pay for"" concept. These bikes are made to be durable and will not compete with any bike you would buy yourself.The benefit is you can bike around the city and just leave it when you're done. No need to come back for it, worry about it, etc. They have bike stations virtually anywhere you'd want you go.Definitely worth the annual fee!  I feel like I'm getting my money's worth."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/06/2017,"DONT USE!!!!!Warning, it is a scam. We purchased $8 for day, the first stop we put in bikes and one didn't register. They continue to charge $8 every 30min. Turns out it was there error as the bike was clicked in but not registering. We waiting half the day with customer service who was not helpfulI think they do this on purpose to make more money as you would never know there is an issue and they have your credit card number.Customer service was smug in saying you signed the agreement so we can legally do it"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/19/2016,"I took a 10 minute bike ride to get from point A to point B and rented two bikes. I docked the bike immediately and should have paid no more than the $2 charge for it's use. The system did not register me returning the first bike, but did register the second. Apparently Robin, the supervisor at Capitol Bikeshare thinks I rode the bike around from 11pm until 7am and charged me $94 for the ride. There is no reasoning with them. Their decisions to not refund me was based off of their system, which did not register my bike's return in the first place. If you are having ANY issues with charges, don't expect customer service to make the right call. I am very disappointed, as I have used the bikeshare many many times, and unfortunately this will be my last."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/04/2014,"Optimally, you would want a smart phone and an app with this system. But even with paper, you could be very very happy.Pluses:With an app, you are assured access to bikes and parking.If you got no app, there are lots of stations. They give you extra time to find a parking spot.Easy.Cheap.Solid bikes that ride well & even have ringers!Fairly stress free: DC has wide sidewalks & except for downtown where the streets are wide.Down side:You need your own helmet.  Also, if you want to travel outside of stationing area, or don't have a pal to baby sit the bike while you run into a store, you need a lock.If you don't have smart phone with app you could get stranded and Real Pissed Off."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/10/2015,Coolest concept ever. So easy and simple to use you don't even need to use the app or become a member. I highly recommend to to tourists and locals alike. My boyfriend and I recently used bike share to bike from AU all the way down embassy row to DuPont circle. It was upper fun and very scenic and interesting to be able to see all the embassies and stop when you wanted unlike in a car. Thanks capital bikeshare for making it hassle free for my boyfriend and I to use your company! ***First 30 minutes free. I forget the rest of the fees but know it's only $8 for the entire day which is super cheap in my opinion!
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/13/2015,"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!! Capital Bikeshare is as corrupt as the men and women in Congress.Go to Bike N Roll and pay a flat fee for a 24 hour period. Buy your own bike if you live in DC!Both options are way cheaper!!Yes I know I should be an adult and read the fine print whenever I agree to terms. Or maybe I should have reviewed their website because unlike their kiosks, they are clear about the outrageous charges after the first 30 minutes. BUT why would I do that when I am spending the holiday weekend in DC and just want to rent bikes to move around the city?  The kiosks are deceptive and only mentions the 24 hour pass purchase for $8 and I'm sure mentions the hidden fees in the 60 page terms of agreement. Of course when I got to check my credit card, I find a nice $100+ surprise charge. I cannot recommend and hope no one else falls for their deceptive practices. Seriously Bike N Roll or a local bike shop is the way to go. At least you know the prices up front ."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/28/2017,Pay attention to the charges- the 24 hr pass is for 30 min at a time so you have to dock it every 30 minutes.  This isn't clear at all at the kiosks. Otherwise they charge you $8 every 30 minutes and you can imagine it adds up quickly. Not worth it.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/30/2016,I tryed to rent a bike the first terminal wouldnt respond second one took my code but didnt unlock the bike the man on the phone then tells me ill have to use a different card but he would refund my money. Therefore i cant use the same card ill have to use another. I dont believe in cards so i only have one. Why shouldnt i be able to reuse the same card. I uber drive in dc and would recommend capitol bikeshare to tourist. Never again will recommend your service to anyone.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/12/2014,"So much fun rt after our dinner date in Capital Hill we decided to grab Two bikes to check it out instead of riding the train. We rode our bike using WAZE to make it back to Columbia Heights. A 3 mile ride about an hr and 20 min walk so about an hr ride. We got misguided a few times bc our GPS didn't have bike GPS so it took us about 1hr and a half but it was super super fun. Burned all the calories I ate from Pound the hill which btw DELICIOUS...  The cost is a hold of $105 per bike but you get that back,  $7 cost and additional $2 per hr or you can the 3 days pass which now I wish we should have done. There's also a yearly plan of only $70. That's what we're getting... So much fun to learn our city. Priceless moment."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/12/2016,"Beware of SCAM fees:I rented a bike for the 24 hour pass ($8).  We returned it after two hours and made sure it was securely returned. I was then charge a $22 late fee by the company for keeping it over 30-minutes, even though I had the one day pass. I am contesting this as a fraud charge with my bank. Their pricing page is misleading and their customer service number doesn't assist at all. I wish this had been a more honest company."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/17/2015,Completely predatory practices. I rented 2 bikes for 24hrs ($14) it was not made clear in any of the material that you have to dock it every 30 mins other wise you will incur additional costs (in my case $28). It does not make it clear anywhere that you need to dock the bike every 30 mins. Customer service is rude and did not want to help out with this issue. I would steer clear of this bike rental.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/03/2016,"I thought that because I was a DC resident and was aware of the tourist accidental full-day rental reviews, that I'd be okay.  I was wrong.I rented a bike for 10 minutes.  I had some issues with the one docking station (there were only two available), but after a couple of tries the light flashed and the bike locked into place-- I checked that it locked because of my difficulties.I look at my account the next day, and it claims I've had the bike for 5 hours.  I email customer support.  They note that they did have my bike at the station after 10 minutes, but there was an error message.  They claim company policy is to only give a 50% refund, no matter what.  I call them.  They say that the phone support is not authorized to do anything beyond give a 50% refund, and they don't even communicate with the company itself which makes the policy.  They can't even give me a contact person, just a generic support email address that never responded. Their practices are incredibly fraudulent, and they really need to be investigated."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/25/2017,"It is a good business practice to make sure customers understand potential fees! How hard would it be to say...check your bike every 30 min to avoid potential fees? This is fraud! I feel violated because I read the sticker over and over and no matter how many times the representative on the phone repeats to me what is says...it is still unclear to ME!!! So those that don't understand are stuck with being screwed!! This experience has made me very angry. The intent was to mislead, otherwise they would publish a simple instruction--check your bike every 30 min or else!!! Will never use this company again for shear principle. I spend my money with good people and not with those who rely on fraudulent business practices to get a few extra dollars."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/25/2016,"PLEASE BEWARE of STUPID FEES!rode the bike for less than 2 hours hoping my credit card would be charged exactly with the amount described in that tiny screen with grey notes. After my ride i secured the bike in a duck but at a different location i had picked it up. Went home and noticed my credit card was charged for $70.!!!!!Called bike share and the guy at the customer service was not responsive at all and seemed to not be aware of their own policies. He told me because u dropped it off at a different location the bike was available until next person used it and the securing process hadn't worked. Next time drop it off at the same location and i'll talk to our manager to see if you can get 50% refund on the charged amount. BULLSHIT!Never got a penny back!I was an idiot renting a bike for the second time thinking that if I drop it off at the same location i picked up it will be fine.Finished my ride in George Washington pkwy trail in 1hr &45 min and this time even dropped it at the exact same duck ""thanks to God it was empty"" hoping it will be less than 12-16$ aside from min 8$ fee.Guess what?! I was charged for 94$!!! Called them again and the same guy said u had to make sure bike was secured when u returned it. IT was secured and I couldn't even move it :)) i even heard that beeping and lucking sound...he said no i can see from ur trip that it lasted for 16 hrs something. Then here he goes again: i ask our manager to review this and give u a 50% refund...! I'm so disappointed with ur shitty service and ducking issues..how the hell i'm supposed to know the duck didn't secure my bike nor did sent u a signal that it's returned? Huh?And how can i prove it to u that I returned it less than 2 hours? Please at least provide a receipt from the same machine showing the return time and amount charged and description of charges for God sakes you thieves!!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/15/2015,"PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS It seems a lot of the unhappy reviews revolve around misreading (or ignoring) the 30-minute rule with the bikes and therefore paying a hefty overage fee... and DANG yeah it can get pricey. But if you stick to the rules... $8 for a full 24 hours is an awesome deal! Between that and the metro there was never a need for my tourist self to get a car.THERE'S STATIONS EVERYWHERE. Especially in the tourists areas--there's like a bike station a short walk from every memorial. Getting the station's app is very helpful because it not only shows station locations, but they show how many bikes are available as well as how many places to return your bike (We had trouble in some less visited areas because the bike racks were totally full and we had to double back and return our bikes elsewhere)BIG AND BULKY BIKESI'm a petite lady who rides a road bike. It took me a few minutes to get used to these--as cruisers they just seemed HUGE plus I never got fully used to the wide placement of the handlebars. But once moving I never had problems with the bike itself."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/12/2017,"Buyer beware....the 24-hour day pass sounds awesome, and a bike is definitely the best way to see DC. Note, however that you can only take bikes out for 30 minutes at a time. Kiosks are not clear, so be sure to look at the fine print in the website.  Our $16 quickly became $60+. Very frustrating."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/12/2016,"Tip: do not make the rookie mistake I did. Check to make sure there are open docks where you intend to return it. I got giant blisters walking and thought I'd be bright and grab a bike to go the remaining 1/2 mile to my house. The dock outside was full. I had to try three others and then walk 3/4 mile home in the end. Plus it was locked in first gear, so basically impossible to get enough momentum to not be wobbly.  I take back most of the bad things I've said about terrible riders weaving around my car as I drive."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/21/2015,"Overall, I like that it was only $18 for three days and their are many stations throughout the city. I love biking and I think this is an excellent addition to the city except for one thing. I think the $100 security deposit is a little ridiculous and they do not return it for 7-10 days. Sorry I did not have time to read the 87 pages on the little screen at the station when I registered for the pass. Chicago, Minneapolis, and NYC did not charge deposits when I rented the bikes in those cities..."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/15/2016,"BEWARE SCAM: misleading and deceptive: I got charged $248 for 1 dayCapital Bikeshare expect you to get the bike and return it every 30 minutes, how absurd is that? When you read the sign or website it seems that it is $2 per ride or $8 for 24 hour but it is NOT.First day they charged me $16 for 2 bikes and the second day they charged me $248. Make sure to read other reviews on another sites, there are many people complaining for similar issues and same problem that I had. I wrote and called customer service, they simply do not care. If you try to return the bike and the station is full, then you are stuck with the bike and you will get charged enormous fees. If I had know that I would have purchased 2 bikes instead and gave them away to people in need. This is plain wrong, misleading and deceptive. This practice is a dishonest way to make money by deceiving people. I got charged 1450% more than what I was expecting to pay. C'mon, this is outrageous!This is a scam! and how can this be endorsed by government agencies? It is a shame that they use our united states capital name to make it such a deceptive business. I am very disappointed and upset to have been misled and over charged.Visited Memorial Day Weekend May 2016"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/26/2017,"My review is based on my experience using the 24-hour pass. There are very few situations where it makes sense to buy one of these passes when you will still accrue the same usage fees you would without one. Despite their staff claiming it is clearly marketed, it isn't. Take a close look at your price options before you use one of these."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/28/2015,"So on my recent trip to DC, we bought metro passes, and well their bus system was awful, and the subway was a little bit better.  So we ended up walking a lot.  Our feet started to hurt and we wanted to have some fun with Bikes.  We read over the very lengthy and semi-confusing pricing.  So basically, you pay for a membership, which allows for free rides for the first 30 minutes and then it's an extra $2 for the next 2 hours? I believe, but then it gets stupid.  It's like an extra $8 for every 30 minutes after that.  Granted, I understand what the point of this program is for, but that is just plain price gauging.  There is a cap for max spending but I believe it comes out to be almost $100 per day if you go past a certain amount of hours.  We figured we would use it for less than the 2.5 hours and those overage charges would not come into play.  They have a physical map and they have an app.  The app is quite useful, as it tells you how many available bikes and/or slots there are at each particular location.  The problem is, one, there was way more bikes than return slots, so even though there was a station near by it was no use to you to return.  And then other places by the time you got there the slots might have filled up, so we were in the 3.5-4 hr range by the time we could return the bikes.  We got hit pretty hard.  Overall, I would have went with a flat rate daily charge from one of the other vendors such as bike and roll.  But if you use this service purely from 1 stop the next, it's amazing!  Proceed with caution!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/14/2017,I wish I read the reviews prior to renting it. This is a perfect scam! How can you advertise it as something thats perfect for tourists to tour monuments? Also they notify you over usage by email even though I chose text.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/29/2016,"This is the biggest waste of time and money. They are misleading with their information. I paid $16 for two 24 hour bike passes. I was then charged $22 two days later. This was due to not docking every 30 minutes. First off, who rents a bike to dock every 30 minutes, second how can you plan a route to have docking station every 30 minutes. THIS IS A SCAM!!! I will never use Capital Bikeshare again and I will tell everyone/anyone to never use it."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/26/2013,"I had so much fun using capital bikeshare. I've lived in the city 2 months now and I've seen the kiosks everywhere, and tourists using them all over downtown but for whatever reason it never appealed to me. I guess I was too intimidated by crazy DC drivers! Today I decided to go for it, from Dupont to the White House, around tidal basin and the memorials, to Lincoln, and back up constitution and then 15th to our final docking. It was a really fun experience, mostly due to the downward slopes and big sidewalks, but it was also a really nice change of pace from the metro and walking everywhere. I will definitely use this in the future."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/10/2016,"Beware. They will charge $$$ and claimed you did not return the bike. I used the bikes for over two years to bike to work. I clocked over 3000 miles on the bikes. I would state that the system has significant problems. First, the bikes are good and they rarely breakdown. However, there many negatives. The slots to return the bikes do not work on a consistent basis. I would guess 35 to 40 percent of the slots at some stations are inoperable. Consequently, you can attempt to return the bike and do not know if it is in fact returned unless you get a green light, which takes several minutes to happen. Many times you will not get a green light and can't move the bike to a new slot. You call customer service and they are clueless, don't care, and have no ability to fix problems.This continued to happen for many months when I used the bike. I complained and nothing changed. I returned the bike one day and Bikeshare claimed it was not returned. They charged me a significant sum claiming I did not return the bike. Then, Bikeshare discovered I returned the bike and still charged me for it.(?????). I mentioned the problem and they did not care. The customer service is terrible and unresponsive. There is a problem with bikes availability at many stations. As of December 19, 2016, the problem remains an issue. Clearly, there needs to be changes in the system to make it work. I don't know when that will occur.  Update: I have discovered new bikeshare programs that don't use slots and are available in DC. They seem cheaper and don't use slots. I would go with them."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/20/2016,"Capital Bikeshare is a a great concept that needs to seriously look at their pricing. The other day I rented two bikes. On the computer screen it said that I had each bike for a 24 hour period and that I would be charged $16. We joyously rode the bikes for 2 hours and then returned them. A few days later, two charges from Capital Bikeshare appeared on my credit card - one for $16 dollars (2 bikes for 24 hours) and the other for $44 dollars. I called the company and the woman explained that when you rent a bike you only have it for 30 minutes and then you have to return it for another bike. The concept of this is absolutely ridiculous in my mind and I would much rather spend $20 renting a decent bike for a day then using one of their crappy 3-gear bikes. I am so disappointed by their misleading 24-hour price and will not be using their services again."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/09/2016,"BE AWARE OF ADDITIONAL FEES IN THE SMALL FINE PRINT!  My wife and I used capital bikeshare to bike around the national mall, which was great.  However, I was shocked to see the additional fees added to my credit card after my vacation was over.  What I expected to cost us only $16 for the day, ended up costing us $76.  To put that in perspective, we had paid only $80 for a lengthy bike tour that was led by an experienced tour guide.  Capital Bikeshare makes you believe that it will be only $8/day.  However, you have to return the bike every 30 minutes for that fee to apply.  Otherwise, additional fees are added.  They need to clearly state that it is $8/day + an hourly rate if you go over 30 minutes.  This disclosure needs to be included up front and not buried in the fine print that no tourist will ever read on a hot day.  This is obviously a ploy to obtain additional money and is an unfair business practice!"

Didn't think we would make it using Capital Bikes, but the ride was pretty smooth and easygoing. We had no trouble at all renting the bikes nor finding stations. Please note: After you return your bike, if you want to get another one within your membership time, you have to use the same credit card from your previous transaction. Click on rent a bike, and you will be given a new code to unlock. You will only be charged for the additional time you use! Furthermore, you may check the cost of your trip using the machine once the bike is returned."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/23/2013,"We used Capital Bikeshare to get around DC during a recent trip down to see the blossoms.  We had come with friends, one of whom had trouble walking, so we decided to give the bikes a try.  I personally thought the kiosk had clear information about pricing to include the usage fees so no problems at all there.  There are plenty of kiosks throughout the city and you can return the bike to any one of them.The bikes were three-speed, in decent shape, comfortable and easy for even the inexperienced rider in our group (me) to navigate.  We had so much fun riding around DC on these, we went out and purchased some bikes this past weekend.  Looking forward to getting out to ride this spring/summer and all with thanks to Capital Bikeshare.  What a great concept for getting around the city easily!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/10/2015,"I love Capital Bike Share. That being said, there are a few things you must pay attention to. My husband and I are locals and have our own bikes, but since we moved out of the city to Arlington, we've been taking advantage of the bike share service and it's great! We either ride the bikes to the metro or ride them into downtown via the Washington & Old Dominion and Mt. Vernon trails. And then we spend our day wandering the city, dropping off and biking up bikes from various stations throughout the day. It's awesome and so much better than having to deal with our own bikes on a day out - plus we can Uber home if we decide to later. I also use bike share for work so I can decide at the end of the day if weather and plans permit a bike ride. A few things to know: 1. In addition to the membership fee, you will get charged a small fee per trip if you ride over 30 min and a larger fee for 60 min, and it increases from there. So try to always dock the bike before 60 min. You can dock it for less than a minute and take it right back out again.2. If you are planing to pick up a bike somewhere in the city and dock it in Georgetown on a Saturday - EVERYONE else has the same plan. Look at the real time app to see what docks have space available and know that if you're going to Georgetown, you may want to dock somewhere else and walk in. 3. Always wait for the green light when you dock it - that means it has registered as returned - if you don't get a green light, it didn't dock. On rare occasion, the station isn't working correctly and it won't register as returned even if you do get a green light. This has happened to me twice. I called customer service. Someone answered quickly each time and resolved the issue to my satisfaction. So - it's good to know they will work with you if you encounter any problems. 4. The bikes are heavy. That means you will be slow and aren't going to carry them up any stairs. But that also means they are sturdy and comfortable for most riders - the seats are comfortable too.In sum - I really love this for commuting and exploring the city. It's great for tourists, but as a local who rides my own bike on the trails, I love this for my leisurely weekend exploration of the city and for commuting."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,11/12/2010,"Build bikeshare, and they will ride? Looks like it! I've been seeing these babies zip by all over Capitol Hill. (yelp.com/biz_photos/Flml) Check out all of these stations!!(capitalbikeshare.com/sta)First off, I haven't really ridden a bike since my tween years, so comfort and ease of use were big factors. Three speeds seemed to function pretty well, and the brakes were very solid. I also like how there is a default light on the bike that flashes at night. The bungee was handy enough to secure my medium sized purse to the front. The $5 a day system and kiosk was very easy to use: just keep in mind that they do have a $100 hold on your account for a few days, so I would be careful which card you put it on. Also, it's only free for the first 30 minutes, with unlimited check ins and take outs during a 24 hour period. It's clearly stated on the stations I've seen, but keep that in mind. Not sure I need to scroll through 100+ pages of disclaimer and agreement on a tiny electronic screen, but it works.  The annual fee is now $75, and monthly is $25. Allegedly, they'll send you a key in the mail within a week and you can get riding!The main reasons I did not get a yearly membership is because I'm still not sure how bike friendly DC is (Capital bikeshare has a station on 16th and Columbia NW, are they trying to kill people?), I'm pretty klutzy on a bike and walking is safer, and because I'm short. Not insanely short...just somewhere between 5'2"" and 5'3"". The bikes, even on their lowest settings, are just a smidge too high for me to put my feet on the ground. However, the seat is fairly easy to adjust, and I would encourage  the less vertically challenged to take a spin.Capital Bikeshare also has a pretty extensive network, and not just right next to metro stations. I like that they have H St NE stations (smartbike didn't even have ANY stations on Capitol Hill). They do need to create an online app so you can check where bikes and free spots are though. I can tell that some stations are always full or always empty, and it would be nice to check it from a phone instead of on a computer.UPDATE: They do have an app now to check on kiosks to see how many bikes/open slots they have. Check out SpotCycle on Android or Apple."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/31/2016,This bike rental is a scam. Unless you re-check the bike in every 30 minutes they will bill your credit card an additional $8 for every 30 minutes!!
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/27/2016,"It was nice riding the bikes, but it is frustrating because there are not often bikes at a lot of the stations. In addition, you must return the bike within 30 minutes to not be charged extra, which can be tricky. I also was charged $100 after riding for not properly ""docking"" the bike, although there are no clear instructions and the dock makes you think the bike is locked because it locks it for 2 minutes apparently and then rejects it. I could BUY a bike for $100. It is ridiculous that they would charge so much after letting you think that you docked the bike properly. And the customer service agent was absolutely unhelpful and rude. Their policy is to only refund 50% - must be nice for them to always be making money off of people with hidden fees! I WILL AVOID IN THE FUTURE."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/05/2016,"VERY misleading company! Buyer beware! We authorized $40 for five 24 hour passes and ended up being charged a total of $162. They lead you to believe you have unlimited use for 24 hours. This is not the case. We loved biking around the National Mall, but Capital Bike Share is NOT the way to go. They have a great product. It's too bad they take advantage of folks. Clean up your act, Capital Bike Share!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,02/27/2015,"I've had an annual Capital Bikeshare (CB) membership for only about a month. Since the CB started I debated whether or not it would be worth it for me. I live in Alexandria and work in DC so using CB to commute to/from work isn't an option since the nearest station is (currently) over three miles from my house. I decided to buy an annual membership because I had a $10 off code and the annual membership will be going up in spring 2015.  So far I've riden a Capital Bikeshare for six trips -- mostly getting from point A to point B in Alexandria, and once going for lunch in DC. These are my impressions:(1) Mostly well-placed docking stations, especially in DC -- but I wish there were many more in Alexandria (perhaps in time there will be).(2) The system is intended more for transportation than recreation. The 30 minutes ""free"" per trip and the overall nature of the bikes aren't conducive to going on long bike rides.  (I assume most customers would recognize this.)(3) So far I've been happy with the number of bikes and empty docks per station.  (4) The bikes themselves are a bit disappointing. I certainly didn't expect high end bikes, and recognize they were built with utility and durability in mind.  However, there's not very much gear range in their three-speed hub transmission. Also, the brakes are very week -- you need to plan in advance of stopping.  (The bikes use some sort of hub brake (I think), and it's possible the brakes will perform better when it gets warmer (it's winter now).) I have two personal bikes that I ride about 3,500 a year, so I'm a huge fan of bicycling (and I WABA member for several years).  I mention this because I'm probably biased towards anything ""bike"". Despite my criticism of some aspects of the bikes, I really like Capital Bikeshare. It's a great addition to the DC/MD/VA metro area that provides another transportation option."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,05/11/2016,"Great way to traverse the Mall, but be watchful of your time !  Capital Bikeshare is great, easy, and fun way to quickly zip around the National Mall taking in all the sights to see.  My boyfriend and I took two bikes from the Jefferson Drive station - nearest the Washington Monument, and proceeded on a clockwise tour around the Tidal Basin taking in the Jefferson Memorial, George Mason Memorial, Tidal Basin sights and Cherry Trees, FDR Memorial, MLK Memorial, DC War Memorial, Lincoln Memorial, Reflecting Pool, Vietnam Memorial, 56 Signers of the Declaration and pool, the WWII Memorial, the White House, finally and Capitol Hill before riding our bikes back down the Hill past the Smithsonians and returning our bikes, ultimately back to the same original station on Jefferson Drive.  Aggravatingly, between all those sights, there is only one station over between the FDR memorial and Lincoln memorial to park the bikes again and reset the 30 min free window of time.  This makes it impossible to pay the $8 for a daily pass and maintain a free charge by staying under 30 mins, as there is simply not enough bike stations to check your bike back in, not to mention you'll find yourself easily spending at least 30 mins or more at each memorial if you really take your time to relax and take in the feeling of each sight.  In the end, we were charged much more than we expected, but after doing the math it was the correct charge as advertised.  In hind sight, I would do it again as riding the bikes sure did beat walking, (there is no way possible to cover that much ground on foot and not want to kill each other from exhaustion and aching feet), feeling the wind as you bike along, and laughing the whole way riding along made the entire experience on the Mall so much more enjoyable.  Just be prepared to spend about $50 a person so you won't feel suckered when you see the charges appear on your card."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/25/2015,"These are awesome bikes. I'd say better maintained than when I had my own bike - because unlike my bike - these bikes get proper maintenance work done by bike professionals constantly. Looking up your route in advance or on a smartphone can help, especially if your destination might have a full rack. I hope the BikeShare expands with more stations and DC gets even better biking infrastructure."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,11/24/2012,"A great way to get around DC to take in sites and to quickly get around. $7 for a 24 hour rental -- can't beat that! Although I was dead tired by my last ride, and don't want to see another bike for months, this was awesome. Just return the bike before 30 minutes and you won't have to pay any additional fees. And there are so many stations, so it's super convenient. Just dock the bike before 30 minutes and take it again if you need to go further.Tip: The app is really useful to find docks and the number of bikes and spots available."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/05/2016,"My son and I rented bikes in Arlington and rode them down to the Mall and to see several of the monuments.  The quality of both our bikes was fine. They are three speed bikes which is enough. The only minor problem I had was that after I hiked my seat up and locked it into place, it very slowly slipped back down.  It was easy to figure out how to rent the bikes and return them.  The place we wanted to return them to was full so we easily got a free 15 minute credit and rode them to a nearby place.  An easy, fun experience.  Since there are great bikes paths around DC I definitely recommend giving them a try."

I have had to ride further than I wanted bcuz there wasn't a stall for my bike. Yes I had to call the number because my bike was registering at the stall as not being returned.

DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,06/20/2016,"We were in DC for the weekend and saw all these people with Capital Bikeshare; thought we'd give it a try.  While I love the idea of this, I wouldn't use them again.  They are crazy expensive with an opaque pricing structure for one thing and secondly, they are terrible to ride.  I have a bike at home and this was like driving an out-of-control blimp on two wheels.  I'm surprised I'm still alive.  We definitely didn't get the use out of them for the price so I can't recommend.  If you are commuting or want to try something fun with cash to blow, this is a good option."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,10/17/2014,"The idea of a bikeshare is fantastic. Think of the pricing like a paid library membership where the library charges overdue fines. You pay for a membership (24 hours = $7), which gives you the right to check out one bike at a time during that window. Once you have a bike, you can use it for up to 30 min for free. After 30 min, you will be charged more fees until the moment you re-dock that bike.Whether or not it pays off depends on a few things:1) How many trips you are taking. The more, the better. (Lower per-cost use.)2) How long your trips are, individually....AKA how quickly you bike. The shorter, the better. (You'll avoid usage fees if you're only taking 15 minute hops, or re-docking in the middle of long-hauls.)3) How BIG your group is. The smaller, the better. (Groups are slow, and Uber or a taxis can make trips cheap)4) If there are available docking stations where you're going. If you can't dock the bike, there's no point.5) Whether you're biking for efficiency, novelty, environmental reasons, or something else. Biking around DC is charming in itself.Basically, any combination of the above desired factors indicates you should hope on the bikeshare train - er, bike. Unfortunately, my personal experience wasn't great.- Not enough bikes were available at our initial station- Not enough docking stations were available at our destination - nor the TWO other nearest stations (if this occurs you can request 15 more mins free, but then you still need to find a station and walk to your intended destination)- All our trips were slightly too long (we kept going over the 30 min by about 10 min)- My reading comprehension went out the window and I ended up paying $44 for two bikes to take only three trips.In a group of 5, we would have been better using Uber for the longer trips and walking the rest. But the bikes are comfy and functional if you can get one....and good luck parking it."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,03/10/2016,"Terrible customer service. Their system broke and failed to register my returning their bike. I called to tell them that it had broken. They said they'd fix it. Instead, they sent me a bill!  What?!  Then when I called to ask them why I was being billed they removed, ""as a one time courtesy"", the fee they were charging me, they then lectured me about returning bikes on time (which I had and which they knew I had because they had sent someone out to verify that the bike was where I said it was). Then, they hung up on me.  This kind of terrible service is typical of monopolies like CBS has in this city. The District government needs to hold them to account for treating their customers right. Meanwhile, know that if you use Capital Bikeshare and they make a mistake... They'll punish you for it and lecture you to boot!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/15/2015,"Best way for tourists to see the Capital (but start at the Capitol building and it's literally all down hill from there - we loved it! Ok, so you have to return the bikes every thirty minutes, just set the timer on your phone and switch bikes-it isn't a big deal and as a tourist and probably infrequent bike rider, stop and have a look-see of the sights!  We have visited DC a few times but on a sunny, mild day and with Capital Bikeshare bikes, we were able to see tons more in less time leaving us more time to enjoy the monuments and museums.  An added plus was that you can get closer to say like the US Capitol building easily (tour busses have to park below then you walk up the oodles of stairs- not fun).   A definite easy and hassle free way to enjoy your visit."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/19/2015,"This was perfect for me. I was a lone female using these bikes for a few days and it was great. Each bike I got was in great shape, the three gears are all I needed, convenient locations to take or leave bikes, just wish there were more farther toward mount Vernon, I would have loved to bike from Arlington all the way to Mount Vernon but I had to stop in downtown old town Alexandria and take an uber car the rest of the way. Still ok, but I would have preferred a bike. There needs to be a kiosk for bikes at Mount Vernon!!!!! Wonderful experience, great way to see DC and memorials."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/13/2017,"Scam!!  If you buy a 24 hour pass  ($8),  it allows you to ride the bike anytime for 24 hours BUT ONLY IN 30 MIN INCREMENTS, if you go over because you can't find a station or empty rack, or just because you riding longer than 30 minutes, you will get dinged another $2."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/15/2015,"My husband and I rented bikes when leaving the National's game one night as the Metro was swamped with people.Easy to find pick up spots and drop off stations.  And plenty of locations as well.The first 30 minutes is free, so if you really want to beat the system, you can find a bike station at 25 minutes, check the bike in and then get a new code to take it out again right away."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/11/2016,"User beware! The $8 24 hr charge only gets you access to the bike. In order to not incur additional charges, you need to return the bike every 30 minutes. READ THE SIGNAGE VERY CAREFULLY. If you do this, DC is a great place to bike as a tourist."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,05/05/2012,"I love the idea of capital bikeshare... I pay a yearly fee and I get to take a big lazy red bike out ofn the street for up to a half hour an unlimited number of times. No worrying about locking the thing up because there is a docking station at the other end. I use the thing nearly every day to get to and from work. The bikes are not fun to ride, but they get the job done and you definitely don't want to steal one. And the truth is that there isn't anywhere that I would want to go on one of these bikes for more than 30 minutes anyway, so the time limit is not a big deal.So why only three stars?The good:Cheap - saves me so much money over metro.Open 24/7 - I often take a bikeshare if I'm working past metro closing.Quick - when it works the system is simple and easy. I also have the yearly pass, so I don't know about the 3 or 7 day versions. I know I've often considered using it when I'm in Toronto as well, so I would definitely use it as a tourist in DC if I knew where I was going, but not a good system if you want to slowly bike around and hold onto the bike for long periods of time. Good number of locations - There aren't as many docking stations as there are CVSs, and there definitely could be more, and you feel it for sure when you can't drop off your bike, but you don't have to go too, too far to get one.The cons:Docking stations are often empty - I tend to commute after the rush, well after the rush in fact, but the docking stations downtown are still often empty at 11, 12 or even 1 am when I'm trying to commute home. There is nothing more annoying than walking around the city trying to find an empty bike share location... this would be easier with a smart phone since they have a nifty app..Docking stations are often full - Actually the only thing more annoying than empty stations are when  you want to drop off your bike and station after station is full. I just found out that in this instance you can get extra time so you don't have to pay incredible fees,but that doesn't mean that turning a 30 minute commute into a 50 minute ordeal of frustration isn't horrible. This happens all too often for me, both coming into work and returning home, especially when the weather is nice.Bikes - too often the bikes are a bit fidgety. since there is usually only one or two bikes at the station when I'm getting it, I'm often stuck limping along on a bike with sketchy brakes, or with gears that are out of tune. The bikes themselves are just not that fun to ride either. Even though they have three gears, only one of them is workable. The other two are too high to be at all useful unless you are trying to go up much steeper hills than we have in DC. What that really means is that all you can do is coast down hill. I'm sure it is a safety feature, but it is still annoying. There has been a lot of concern about the pricing system, and I do see a fair number of tourists cruising around on bike share bikes in places that have go to be more than 30 minutes away from a station (Old town for instance on the Mount Vernon Trail). In order not to compete with regular bike rental places they put up a system that is VERY expensive for anyone who has the bike out for more than 30 minutes. That means that tourists who want a lazy cruise around the monuments are MUCH better off just renting a bike from a store that does that kind of thing. The system really isn't intended to be used like that. Of course, I can understand how I could easily not read the fine print and not figure that out, and how I'd be pretty mad if that happened to me. Overall a great idea and a good addition to the transportation environment, but there are some kinks that need to be worked out. Unfortunately, I've been using it for almost a year now, and I don't see those things being worked out."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/09/2017,"It is a good concept, although I wish the bikes could be checked out for more than 30 minutes at a time, but the implementation is poor.  Only 30% of the time can I either find a bike at a station or dock a bike at a station.  The company needs to improve."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/09/2014,"Program is catered towards tourists. If you plan to commute, it's not worth the hassle of finding a spot to park your bike on the way home. I've wasted much time riding from 21st and E street NW to Farragut North station, only to have to ride the bike all the way back to the starting point and walk back because everything between Farragut back to E street is full up. I just put in a request to cancel my membership because I don't even want this to be an option anymore.The amount of users are increasing but the capacity for parking does not."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/06/2015,Never a place to park the bike near the smithsonian until visiting hours are over.You have to get the phone app and then race all the other hot grumpy people to a bike station when the app shows a parking spot is open
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,01/30/2014,"Capital Bikeshare is a fantastic piece of the broad transportation infrastructure in DC. It's not perfect, but I couldn't be happier that it exists.That said, the negative reviews here seem to come from people who fall in two camps: 1) visitors who don't understand the pricing structure and 2) commuters who rely on Bikeshare for daily transportation needs.Visitors: the pricing structure as per the website is quite clear. You pay for a membership fee plus usage fees. The first 30 minutes is free; after that you pay. The idea that you can get a bike for 24 hours of unlimited use for 7 bucks should seem suspicious when you realize that the private bike rental companies that actually DO offer that service charge 5-times or more for it. Please take some time to read how usage fees work before racking up minutes on the bikes. It's not that hard.Commuters: balance has been a problem for the Bikeshare system since it's launched. I've been burned by full docks before. It's frustrating, I get it. Like any transportation system, it will have problems. Traffic jams are common on the Beltway.  Metro breaks down all the time. Bikeshare has its issues too. When you use one mode of transportation enough, eventually the little problems start to add up into greater annoyances. The bikes are heavy and not especially fun to ride. But again, it has its place. I have a light hybrid bike I mostly ride around the city. I have Bikeshare for when I need to make a one-way trip, or when I want to get someplace a little quicker than it would take to walk. As long as you don't need to rely on it for all or most of your transportation needs, it fits in well with the other options we have."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/11/2014,"I moved to the area recently, and got a 3-day membership a few times to test it out, before deciding if I wanted a year-long commitment. There are bike stations near my house and near my work, and both are usually half-full when I need to pick up or drop off a bike, so at that point, I would have given five stars for the service. About six weeks ago, I went online, paid my year-long membership fee, and waited for the key to show up. As of today, I'm still waiting. Their website happily explains that there's a shortage of bike keys- and they're expecting a big shipment in ""next week."" I've called, a few times, and each time they say ""next week."" Meanwhile, I'm now on month two of being charged for a service I can't use."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/22/2017,Major Pain!! Hard to find available bikes. Racks would be empty more often than not. The racks are far and few so next to impossible to make it to another location within 1/2 hr if you stop anywhere even for a shirt period. The app was useless. They make it sound D cheap and easy but it's neither!! Go else where and rent a bike for the day. You'll pay more upfront but no Hassel afterwards.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/16/2016,Very approachable on the phone if having an issue. Best thing we could have done in DC
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/19/2014,"This is a review for one of the technicians that helped me and a buddy out the other day.  To make a long story short, we had lunch the McDonalds on River Road in Bethesda and when we got back to the car, the battery was DEAD.  We were parked next to a Capital BikeShare rack and one of their techs - Larry was kind enough to offer his help with the use of some tools.  MY friend and I actually had to go across the street to the Volvo parts location and pick up a battery for his recently bought S-80.  Larry was kind enough to wait until we got back to ensure that we would have the tools necessary to install the new battery.15 min later, we were on our way.  He refused our offer of a tip and was totally an all-around cool guy.Capital Bikeshare......thumbs up for having an awesome employee!*I live in the area and have my own bike, but will recommend that you deal with a company that employs great employees like Larry!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/05/2015,Worst experience renting something!!! For three hour they changed me $ 54.25 when it was suppose to be $8.00 When I call the customer service they said they only would reimburse me 50%
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,04/07/2014,"While I love that such a service exists, the pricing structure used by Capital Bikeshare is clearly not tourist-friendly.  Now that I've seen the website I understand it, but their kiosks are misleading as they tout the low prices for short-term rides.  And it's difficult to find kiosks around the monuments, the area that would be most helpful to tourists.The fact that I did not catch on to the pricing structure is on me.  Buyer beware and all that.What's not on me is that I've got hundreds of dollars of charges on my credit card that I was not expecting.  Apparently there is a $100 per bike deposit which they don't tell you about either on their website or the kiosks.  But the customer service guy was really decent about it when I called, and he actually knocked a bit off the charge.On a positive note, the kiosks are easy to find and the bikes are sturdy.  The bungee cords for gear are a nice touch."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,12/30/2014,"It's not perfect, but for the logistically complex puzzle the bikeshare probably is, I am overall impressed. Given how expensive the metro is for daily use, and how frustrating buses can be, Capital Bikeshare has saved me hundreds on public transit overall. The only thing you can't really do with bikeshare is go for long joy rides given the fees. It is a very utilitarian sort of set up. I suppose if you wanted to go joy riding, you can always just rent a normal bike, but how nice it would be to just grab a bike from a kiosk spontaneously and just pay some day fee? I guess that would make the number of bikes at the stations a little too unpredictable though. Anyway. I am thankful for Capital BikeShare."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/01/2017,"Be careful of the fine print.  We rented several bikes and chose the $8 for 24 hour option.  They charged us almost $100 because they say we did not dock the bikes every 30 minutes.  I don't recall seeing this requirement clearly on the kiosk.  Great concept but very expensive.  When we shared our experience, another friend of ours had the exact same issue.  Beware."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/13/2014,"I have a car, Zipcar, Car2Go, two bikes of my own and an annual Capital Bikeshare membership. And I love, love, love CB. So convenient if you're heading one-way on a bike but not sure how you're going to get home. The bikes are easy to ride, and the system is easy to figure out. More than three years into their service here in D.C., the fleet management continues to get better and better -- it's rare to find a bare rack or one that doesn't have a space to leave your bike. The smartphone app is awesome, and customer service is super fantastic. I had to replace a broken membership key, and the fellow that helped me out on the phone was super friendly, and I was back up and running within a few days! Memberships are great even if you have your own bike -- perfect for out-of-town guests!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/26/2016,"Buyer beware! There is a lot of fine print with this company and I made the mistake of thinking a 24-hour pass for $8 was just that. I rented the bike in Silver Spring suburbs and rode into D.C. on the Georgetown trail. The ride was about 2 hours. Then I docked the bike and hopped on the Metro to return. Fast forward to a $30 charge on my card in addition to a separate $8 charge -- I called the company and the RUDEST person explains their punitive policy if you don't dock the bike every 30 minutes...This was virtually impossible. There were no apparent docks along the trail between Bethesda and D.C. Agent: ""You should have planned your trip better."" He honestly came off as snarky and irritated as though he frequently receives the same complaint. Newsflash: Obviously you are either intentionally or unintentionally unclear with relaying this policy. I'm guessing the former bc no one in their right minds would willingly agree to those terms. I did ask if this information was buried in the terms 120+ page agreement on the 2x4in kiosk screen. He did not know.  He did, however, let me know that it is stated on the recent (that you receive AFTER you've paid) and on the somewhere on the bike (that you retrieve AFTER you've paid). SMH.I wish I had come here first to find similar warnings. Hopefully this review bumps the complaint for the next sucker in line for this scam. Note: This is my first negative review. The single star rating is because the nasty phone agent that made a bad situation worse. WTF."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/07/2014,"After 4 years of resisting, I finally caved and bought a membership. Worth it? Absolutely. Being able to bike one way and not having to worry about keeping your own bike safely locked relieves pressure in so many different situations (plus I now have the much easier option of biking home when I decide to go for a run, which does not happen often.)The bikes are almost always well-tuned, and although they're sort of tank-like, that makes them fun to ride. It's a great system and I love having it here."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/19/2014,EPIC!I've been on this little train for over a month now just cruising the city every weekend and just enjoying the sites and sounds. Its crazy how many stations they have. Its key to have a smart phone with the app...it makes it all so much easier to maintain. The customer service is very helpful and very responsive. I haven't had a problem since I've used it over 20 times.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/15/2013,"The best way to save money on transportation, see DC, and exercise all at once. I purchased a month pass for around $25 and the key was mailed to me shortly before my trip to DC. Your pass isn't activated until you do it yourself online.There are countless stations throughout the DC Metro area and they seem to be adding more every day. If you happen to stay or live near a rack station, that means less walking for you. Once you insert your key, a beep will be heard with the yellow light lit. Once the light turns green, you can pull out the bike and your time begins. Remember, you have 30 minutes of free ride time. However, once you return your bike to another station (or the same station), you can retrieve another bike and the 30 minutes starts again. From my experience, you can pretty much get anywhere in the DC area in 30 minutes. It only took me 20 minutes to ride from Dupont Circle to National Park in the Navy Yard. You will be charged extra anytime you go beyond 30 minutes for any particular session. When returning your bike, make sure there is a beep and the yellow light is lit and wait until the green light is lit indicating that the bike was successfully returned. Before taking a bike, make sure the height of the seat is correct. Also, adjust the intensity of the gear (1 to 3) turning the right handle. Front and rear lights automatically come on when the bike is in use regardless of whether it's night or day.If you have a smartphone, having the free Spotcycle app is vital. The app will notify you of the nearest stations to your location, how many bikes/racks are available at a particular station, a map of all stations, and even a timer.Just a quick reminder. If you happen to ride to a station that is full, you can call Capital Bikeshare and they will add 10 or 15 minutes for you to find another nearby station to return the bike."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/21/2015,"WHAT YOU SEE IS NOT WHAT YOU GET.i'd like to first start off this review with the fact that i rarely, if ever, review anything on yelp. This should be the first indication that this is either the greatest thing to man or an absolute atrocity (harsh, but my feelings at the moment)I absolutely love the idea of capital bikeshare. In fact, I recently used capital bikeshare for the second time in DC to give my cousin a tour of the monuments and memorials. The idea is simple- rent a bike for what seems to be a measly $8 for a 24hr time frame and be able to travel through the city with ease by cruising through the streets. I'd like to preface this story with the fact that my cousin and I had an absolutely fantastic day full of memories that i can never and will never take back! We were able to see nearly every monument on her list in a quick and easy trip. To be honest, if i had not just checked my bank statement, I would continue to recommend this product to any tourist. However, what the extremely hard to view kiosk tells you, ""allegedly,"" in the fine print is that you are not only charged this flat rate of $8, but you are also charged additional fees if you do not DOCK your bike every 30mins........had this been clearly outlined- my cousin and i would have done this to avoid the rack up of fees that we were charged 4 days later.  We were charged 6 times the price after 4 hours because we did not dock the bikes in the randomly scattered locations. Not only is this completely, impractical, but also a S C A M. I called my bank thinking that the kiosk had been loaded with some sort of scamming material and was then redirected to a capital bikeshare employee who ruthlessly proclaimed that this was MY FAULT. Why in God's name would i rent a $54 bike................................. when i could just go on a proper tour??If you are into being ripped off, please by all means, place your credit card in their kiosks and roll out."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,11/22/2016,"Riders beware: the hidden fees and unauthorized charges that have shown up on my credit card have been insane. I've been using the $2 per ride option to try it out before commiting to a membership. I just ride back and forth between my apartment and a yoga studio about 2 miles away- the max time I've used a bike is 10 minutes. Well last week I had a recurring charge of $94 that I didn't authorize. When I called to ask why, I was told that there was an issue at the docking station and the station did not recognize my bike when I redocked it. So they charged me for a 21 hour rental! Who is riding a bike for 21 hours? I always make sure that the green light shows when docking but due to a supposed error they scammed me out of $94."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/22/2016,Pricing for single trip is unclear. Customer service is horrible.
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,11/13/2013,"From a DC Commuter:The Capital Bikeshare has made commendable gains:  expanding the bike culture in DC, increasing drivers' awareness of bikers, decreasing commute times, reducing dependency on cars/trains/buses, etc.  But....they have a long way to go.These bikes are actually horrible.  They are heavy, there are only 3 gears, and the bikes are sometimes in shoddy condition (either a piece is broken, the brakes aren't great, or the seat slides down as you ride).  Beyond the quality of the bikes they haven't quite figured out the basics of supply and demand, resulting in empty bike stations when you're looking for a bike, and full stations when you're trying to park a bike.  This morning, for example, I was one of about 5 bikers going from station to station trying to find an open dock.  I biked 15 blocks to work, but then I had to retrace my ride back 5 or 6 blocks past 3 full stations before I found an open dock.  This doesn't happen all of the time, but I've found full stations 4 of the 25 times I've parked bikes, and found empty stations about the same number of times.  Not a horrible batting average - but pretty frustrating when I'm relying on it as my means of transportation.Until they can open enough stations in the right places, I recommend they stage trucks at the most popular stations during the morning and evening commutes to quickly redistribute bikes."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/22/2014,"Excellent . Simple. Straight forward. Great way to cover alot in short time.I didnt really care to see much in ""the mall"" so while riding the bikes we did a ""summary"" of the sites, we did this in a fraction of the time it would take on foot.  This allowed more time for day-drinking"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/20/2013,"Great way to get around DC/VA. $7 day pass is all you pay if you stop at a station every 29 minutes (at 30 minutes you get charged $2 until 59 minutes). There are tons of stations and getting around will never take that long so it is fairly simple to keep the cost low while touring DC. The bikes are comfortable, my girlfriend is 5'1"" so she had some difficulty stopping and starting, I am 6'2"" and the seat post was plenty long. The brakes suck on all the bikes. Gears (3) change smoothly. Upright ride."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,02/21/2016,Terrible customer service--told me I didn't redock the bike and threatened a 94 dollar fee. Still don't know if I will be refunded or what. Also didn't accept American Express although they advertised that. Shaky bikes but decent enough. It was just the implementation and customer service that was horrible.
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/31/2013,"Great Idea!  I didn't read the website nor did I read Yelp before heading into DC to rent these bikes to tour around DC.  The machines and placards didn't really explain that there are additional charges. Or if it did, I didn't see it as I just saw that it was $7/day.  I rented 2 bikes, and it turned out to be $24 total instead of the $14 that I thought renting 2 bikes for a day would be.  I called the 800 line and the lady was kind enough to refund me 60% of the additional  charges.  She explained that the bike sharing program is really for a quick bike ride of 30 minutes and that is why there are additional charges after 30 min.  Even still $24 for riding around the monuments for several hours is a pretty good deal.  Now I know!capitalbikeshare.com/pri  click on link for pricing."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/22/2017,"I rented two bikes for my daughter and myself at Wilson and 31st in Arlington on July 21. We literally had the bikes for 10 minutes -- just enough time to ride to the bottom of the hill and dock them at Arlington Mill Road -- less than a mile away. This was only my second time renting from Capital Bikeshare and I didn't re-dock the bikes properly. I happened to check my bank account on July 22 about midday and noticed a charge of $62 in addition to the $4.00 rental charge from Capital Bikeshare. I called and spoke with two different representatives who explained that one bike was returned five hours later to a station on Four Mile Run and the other had not yet been returned and was still accruing charges. Maurice said they could authorize a one-time courtesy reimbursement of half of the charges -- which could not be finalized until the other bike was returned. I drove down two the Arlington Mill station and located the bike that was parked but not properly docked. I locked it into place and called back to speak with a supervisor. After calling back several hours later, I was told a supervisor would contact me at 11 pm. Irene did call me but said exactly the same. It was my fault for not docking the bike properly, the instructions are clearly printed on the kiosk, and she could only authorize half of the charges refunded. I said I found that outrageous as an annual pass costs less that my total charges -- which amounted to $157.00. I could have purchased a day pass, a three-day pass, AND an annual pass for less. I asked to speak with someone above her and was told there was no one. I called back later and asked another representative, Cynthia, for the name of Irene's supervisor. She said Ashley and Irene are the only two supervisors; there is no one above them. I find it extraordinary that a business can blindly rob people, legally. Capital Bikeshare is BANKING on novice users to make a docking mistake so they can profit. If they cared about the customer, they would notify customers via text when their time is near expiring -- that would be GOOD business. I never received any notification that the bikes had not been docked properly -- even though that is a question addressed on their FAQ page. If I hadn't checked my bank account, that bike would still be accruing charges. I am just asking for a little kindness and compassion. I understand that I made an unfortunate mistake, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Give me an annual pass OR reduce the rate to $25, and IMPLEMENT A NOTIFICATION SYSTEM to customers! I will make sure every online reviewer hears this story and I will never rent from a this company again -- absolutely no humanity!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/27/2017,"It's a fantastic idea, but it's absolutely unreliable/one of the worst services I've ever used. I rode a bike 3 minutes down the rode, docked the bike properly, and then was charged $98 the following day without warning. When I called in and spoke to customer service, they informed me that the bike was not docked until 1 day and 6 hours later. I argued that I indeed rode the bike1 mile down the rode and docked the bike properly. After several arguments relating back to the fact that the bike was found in the exact same spot, and they reduced it to $46. I had explained that I can guarantee the ""green light"" showed up signaling that the bike was docked properly, but they argued that this was not the case. It was an extremely unpleasant process that took nearly 2 hours on the phone. After reading reviews online, unfortunately I'm not the only person that's had this issue..... I will never use one of these bikes again."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,07/16/2013,"Greatest idea ever, or greatest idea ever? Wish we had this in Dallas (according to google, it's coming). Pay a daily price of $7 and bike around the city looking at all the landmarks and even getting from one neighborhood to another. If you dock your bike at a bike station in less than 30 minutes, then no additional charge. If you go over, it's $2 extra. 18 hours over the bike is considered stolen, if you don't dock it.So I was in DC for 2 days and my husband and I got these bikes to ensure that we could see the maximum amount of the city in the 2 days we were there. However, we saw many natives utilizing the system as well. I even rode home to the hotel after bar-hopping with friends. A much easier time than walking on my sore feet. Easy to figure out. I love things that encourage exercise and reducing our carbon footprint."

DC,5,Positive,Yelp,01/29/2013,"What could possibly be better?  You can ride these bikes FREE for up to 30 minutes and then just dock it at one of their kiosks.  You don't need to lock it up, maintain it or worry about it at all.  You do have to get an annual membership fee of around $75 or so, but it's worth it.You get exercise, zoom around DC and save on cab or metro fare.  It couldn't be easier to insert your fob into the docking station and ride off and then redock when you're done.These bikes do get very expensive if you spend lots of time on them.  But you can just return the bike to a kiosk after 30 minutes and get a new bike for another 30 minutes.  Repeat as long as you want!You need to be savvy about making sure you have a kiosk with open slots where you want to return your bike.  You can check their website and/or get a mobile app for this.  Also, there is a computer screen at the kiosk that tells you how many docks are open and how many bikes are available at nearby kiosks.This system works in other cities like Paris and is a natural for DC.The bike are a little clunky, but you're not Lance Armstrong so don't worry about it!!!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/31/2011,"I love Capital Bikeshare! I just got a year membership and it is great. I don't use it for commuting to work so don't have any supply/demand issues some other do. My work doesn't have a shower and so that is not an option. Well I guess I could show up at work all sweaty and gross, but ewwwww. I've used it on the weekends and after work. After using a couple dozen times there has only been once that I have not been able to find a bike and that was in Farragut where there are a bunch of stations so no problem. I am getting a great workout and no longer have to wait for stupid metro for forever. Yay - no more metro! And I'm super excited bikeshare is expanding to even more area yippeee :)"
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/12/2013,"Capital Bikeshare is my favorite way to get around the city... when I can actually find a bike.The idea is wonderful. For $75 a year and get a fob that lets you rent a bike from any station; you get 30 minutes of bike time then you return the bike somewhere else. The problem is  half the time there are no bikes within a 1-2 miles of where I am (you can check where bikes are available from your smart phone which is very convenient). The good news is Capital Bikeshare knows this is a huge problem, addressed it on their blog, and is trying to fix it. Unfortunately their suggestion to frequent users ""just get your own bike"" seems to miss the point of why I signed up for bikeshare in the first place. If you are planning on using Capital Bikeshare for your daily commute I recommend you either leave to/from work 20-30 minutes early to make sure bikes are available or you have alternative transportation available. Ideally they would take the time to fix this problem before expanding into Maryland as it will likely exacerbate the problem.The bikes themselves are in pretty good condition and accommodate people from 5' to 6'4"" without difficulty. They are very heavy but  smooth and beginner friendly. Also when you sign up with capital bikeshare you get  discounts to many local businesses including   Zipcar and Car2Go. This is really handy if you like the idea of a bike/car share combo.I really like Capital Bikeshare and judging by its popularity so do many other people. I hope its currents problems are just growing pains and as time goes by they figure out how to make bikes available to everyone who wants one."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/22/2012,"Given that Metro was designed primarily to alleviate rush hour commuting, it's amazing that it can't even accomplish that.  ""Trackwork on Nights and weekends""... Christ I'll stop there.  I usually take Bikeshare for a short hops under a couple of miles.   They're nothing spectacular but it's a good option when your choices are a 30 minute walk, 10 minute bike ride or 20/unknown minute Metro wait.  The $7 is good for the day, so if you do it round trip, you're almost even with taking Metro and probably arrived faster. The one time I reported a maintenance issue about a kiosk, they responded by email to acknowledge it would be fixed.  Otherwise, bikes have been adequate and I don't see any surprises with pricing.Bonus points over Metro: nobody has ever tried to steal my iphone and I don't have to smell unshowered protestors from the bike."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/12/2015,"Don't try this on a busy weekend. Also, since we couldn't dock our bikes within 90 minutes (and would have to wait in a LONG line just to ""extend"" time by 15 minutes), we ended up paying an additional $8 each. So two people rode for two hours and it cost us a total of $44, which included the $8x2 registration fee for 24 hours. Not worth it at all and I deserve my extra $16 back. Also, you run the risk of docking your bike at a busy location and then there not being any bikes for you to take when you're ready to leave. If they figure out how to make it work better, it will be nice. But until then, I don't recommend this at all."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/08/2013,"If you're visiting the city and want to look adorable while sightseeing then the Bikeshare is a good option.  If you're hoping to commute to work then be prepared for a lot of frustration.Its great people are embracing the Bikeshare but trying to use this service to commute during rush-hour is practically impossible.  Most stations just outside of downtown are empty before 8:00am and it is more than likely you'll have difficulty finding a place to return a bike around downtown between 8:20am and 9:30am.  Capital Bikeshare is aware of the problem but has only advised people ""who use Capital Bikeshare frequently and for regular roundtrips, such as commuting from popular origin stations to popular destination stations, it might make sense at a certain point to just get your own bike"" and given that is the best they can do I'll pass on their own words and discourage folks from using the service for anything other than casual riding."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/28/2015,"I had a great experience with Capital Bikeshare. This was my first time using this type of system. My brother, sister and I decided to have a fun afternoon in DC before summer is over. and we enjoyed it, it was so worth it, we got plenty of pictures. This system is easy to use and they have many spots in DC to find and park it after you're done. they tell you to download this app on your phone to find map of locations: ""Spotcycle"". The system takes credit card or debit card (good thing b/c i only had debit card). The pricing is fair. You can call the tech support and they answer right away. Thanks."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/19/2016,"After you learn how the system and equipment work, this is a fantastic service.  Some aspects take getting used to, and until you've done so, you're likely to get frustrated sometimes. For example, you arrive at a docking station only to discover that there is no place to dock your bike (You have to learn to check the Spotcycle smartphone app first).  Also, most DC residents commute at similar times and in similar directions, and it's simply impossible for the rebalancing trucks to get enough bikes back out to the docking stations in residential neighborhoods quickly enough in the morning to cover everyone's needs.  I am still frustrated that there are huge areas with no docking station at all, including where I live - which is about 0.5 miles from six or seven different docking stations.  They form a chain of rosaries around where I live, but none are all that close to my home.  That last 1/2 mile is long enough that it's frustrating not to be able to ride closer, and when leaving in the morning I pass two bus stops before reaching a docking station, and often enough a bus pulls up and I just take it.  I keep hoping Capital Bikeshare will fill in with more docking stations, but I assume the problem is that the manufacturers aren't making the equipment fast enough and that it's hard to gain permissions or even find the right available sidewalk space that can be used for this purpose.  Still, I wish for more in-filling in the inner neighborhoods of DC.  Also, you have to learn to lift the bikes slightly when docking (otherwise, you sometimes don't get the green light that tells you you've successfully docked and can leave).  Some of the docking stations are wearing out and require this extra step.  But in general this system works so well for me and for others with annual memberships that I can no longer imagine living without it.  It is a fantastic substitute for car, bus, Uber, mass transit, etc., and it's essentially free, i.e., once you've paid the annual membership and assuming you don't keep the bikes more than 30 minutes at a time (which I never travel far enough to need to do).  I love it and would never want to stop using Capital Bikeshare."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/02/2016,"This company is a complete joke with the ""hidden"" fee crap.  A 4 hour bike ride cost $46, simply because they tucked away their 30 min re-docking requirements on page 87/120 of their agreement (which, as another user mentioned, is displayed on a tiny screen written in DOS).  I was extremely disappointed by this revelation of extra fees after checking my credit card statements, and then reading all the reviews.  I could have purchased a halfway decent brand new bike at Walmart for $46 had I know this.  2 star simply because riding around DC was fun & the general concept is decent.  Now if they could just fix their shady fee structure & false advertising, it may be deserving of a 4 star review."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/04/2013,"we were excited to see another bikeshare system much like the one in monteral. :) it's a great way to see the city because it allows so much flexibility. for a 24 hour membership, it is 7$. for the first 0-30 minutes, it's free. then $2.00 for an hour and so on. loves:-tons of bike stations to return to-super duper durable yet light enough for a little girl like me -front and back lights -- for riding in the dark-a little strap in area to hold you purse, backpack, small items-kickstand-very simple share systemthe only thing i didn't love was biking through the heart of dc. there are quite a few cars and they seem to tolerate the tourist/ bikers lol. it's encourage to ride on streets but i spent some time on the sidewalk. we rode these at night. got 'em in logan circle area and returned in chinatown area. all the while, we got to zip through the national mall, reflecting pool, capitol hill, lincoln memorial (ps. they don't allow bikes up there..)easily a favorite during our stay!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/05/2015,"HORRIBLE website!! Tried to find a location near our hotel and drop down box nor the address input would work. Tried cell phone, IPad and desktop. This company, which depends on the Internet should have a working site for its customers. In addition, the kiosks DO NOT ACCEPT AMEX.  So, you have to use a Visa or MasterCard....EXCEPT, you can only rent 2 bikes with 1 CC. So, if you are a family of 3 or more, you have to use multiple Visa/MasterCards. Very dumb and inconvenient. Would not use this service again. Needs to be streamlined."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/27/2013,"If I read these reviews or about the program earlier I wouldn't have racked up the bill we had for 2 bikes for 2 and a half hours. I'm not sure what I was thinking given my boyfriend having foot issues so the biking helped tremendously. It was the first time I rode a bike in about 15 years, and I was a little nervous here and there but I did it. It helped that the bike baths here were clean and easily marked, and it was nice to have wide sidewalks and paths up to the monuments and museums. The bikes are a bit heavy, but makes me feel good that it is sturdy, and it has a small basket to hold on to your purse or bag pretty securely. It was a great way to see the city. I highly recommend using the bikes and would do it again. It's quite affordable if you do it right and stop at the stations before the 30 minute mark and take out a new bike."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/22/2013,Capital Bike Share is revolutionary. We were in town for a quick 3 day tour and renting bikes from the easy to use kiosks was a great way to bike the city. We were able to bike along the Potomac all the way to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial--then dropped the bike off. The BEST way to see the city.
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,04/27/2015,"Easy and fun way to get around Arlington and DC. Their pricing is very deceiving. I emailed customer service about this and their reply was ""here is a picture of our kiosk, how can we make pricing more clear?"" Not really my idea of stellar customer service. Due to the price I most likely will not be renting again."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/11/2015,Complete SCAM. You have to return bike every 30 minutes when It Clearly says you are renting it for 24 hours... What a misleading way to earn money... Shame and will never Rent a bike from here again i was charged $188 .
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/17/2014,"Everything was fine until I was told that $200 will be held out of my account for 5-10 business days for the 2 bikes that I rented for less than an hour. I understand this is the policy, but it's still just super upsetting and RIDICULOUS to hold the money for that long."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/23/2010,"I signed up for Capital Bikeshare (or CaBi, as some affectionately call it) before it launched in trust that it would live up to expectations, and so far I'm thrilled.  Will this replace your primary transportation?  No.  Might you feel a little silly on a bright red and yellow bike?  Possibly.  Is this a totally awesome way to get around?  For sure!  Plus, it's cheap and it's green! The first thing everyone asks is about the bikes... unlike the SmartBikes, these bikes actually resemble a normal bike.  They're a little clunky, but seem to be sturdy and well designed.  Each bike has three speeds with a gear shift on the handle, chain guards, a bell, a basket in front (that surprisingly doesn't look too dorky), and front and back lights for riding at night.  In terms of comfort, for the relatively brief time that you will be on the bike, it's comfortable enough.For now, only about half of the stations are in place, but there's a Google map on Capital Bikeshare's website showing planned stations.  When complete, there will be 1,100 bikes at 110 stations through DC and Arlington, which is awesome, although until a mobile app is released (which is said to be in the works), you need to check the website in advance to find the closest station to your destination.  This time around, it appears that the District has chosen a well thought out bike sharing system that has enough coverage to be convenient and useful, and bikes that are actually worth riding.  If you're still not convinced, try it for a day, see how great it is, then sign up!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/15/2015,"I'm a yearly member of Capital Bikeshare  & used to be a big fan...but no longer.They are having real issues with their membership fobs, which in very short time no longer work  at the bike kiosks.  I had 2 fobs which went bad just in a few months apart. Getting the fob replaced the 2nd  time has also turned into a ridiculous debacle.So, the first time the fob stopped working it was easy, breezy to get it replaced- you simply called Cap Bikeshare...they popped a new fob into the mail and gave a couple 3 day passes to tied you over until your new one arrived.So, a few months later when the new fob also went kaput, I was annoyed but not excessively so because of the ease of getting a new one. Little did I know. It's now been over a month and 5 phone calls to their customer service...and still no replacement fob forthcoming. I've been give the complete runaround in the process as well, where 2 agents will say the replacement has been shipped, only to find out weeks later from a very insistent call to their management that no such shipment occurred. And management was not overly helpful either- his suggestion was that I should call the local office. Mind you, this is on the 5th call already on my part to their customer service dept yet my request then for HIM to call the local office fell on deaf ears.Now, in that interim, while they did give me day passes (some agents more generously than others) on each call to get me through the month so far, those are a bit of pain to use. It's more the total experience and inept customer service which has left a complete sour taste in my mouth.Bikeshare commuters take notice."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/14/2010,"YOU GUYS...I'm obsessed with Capital Bikeshare. I tried it out a handful of times and finally bought the $50 annual membership right before the month was up. I feel like I have already made up that amount in ""free rides"" of less than 30 minutes that I would have paid at least $1-3 on the metro or circulator. In other cases, it just gives me a connection that saves walking. I even rode one from Chinatown to Capitol Hill (okay, I walked it up the hill...) at 3am after the Harry Potter 7 premiere.In 2ish months, I've only had two instances of getting to a station and finding it either full when I have a bike to return, or empty when I need to grab one. Just yesterday I was in a rush and got to the station to find that my key didn't work and instead flashed the red light and beeped at me repeatedly. The technicians that happened to be there said to call the number and someone picked up right away and fixed the problem in seconds.The bikes are sturdy and stylish (a teenage boy I rode past near the mall exclaimed: ""Oh man! I want a bike like that!""), with 3 speeds and a bell. The docking and undocking process is super fast, and the key/keychain is small and unobtrusive. The seat is pretty comfortable as well. The tires are like what you'd find on a mountain bike. There's also a basket with a bungee cord to secure your things.The only downside of this service? Constantly being asked by people at stations or when stopped at lights what I think of it and how does it work and how much does it cost and is it easy to use, etc.! I always tell them it's worth it!"
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,12/10/2012,"Good idea. The bikes are in good condition. Major draw backs: you are ready to leave and there are no bikes.You.can't get a 30 day pass at a station. Takes 2 weeks.to receive long term passShort term pass does not transfer so if you need a bike you can pay $74 PLUS the hourly rate while waiting for your pass to arrive ----- just buy a NEW BIKE, it's cheaperI tried to join with the monthly pass but I need a bike now. I liked the idea of a bike that was always clean and in working order but it's too much to spend while waiting.  I tried calling to see if there was any way around it. If I could get a credit for the 3day passes I would need. No effort was made to address the problem.The bikes are in good condition because they are made of steel. Or lead, heavy!I would be a monthly subscriber Sweet job customer service. I have a super cute vintage road bike from Craigslist. Paid $125 for a super tune up so it's just as road worthy"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/22/2015,"My wife and I both have annual memberships and love the system. We live in the city, so the system makes it incredibly easy to zip around town. It has easily saved us more than it costs in short trips in a Lyft/taxi alone, and a huge time saver in instances where we'd walk."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/17/2014,"If I could rate 0 stars I would.  I was charged $7 originally for a bike. When I tried to take the bike the key wouldn't work and I couldn't use any of them. So I walked the 2 and a half miles I was planning to take the bike on. After I called the company to get my money bag, they told me they would hold $101 for 10 days.... $101 for a bike I didn't use... For 10 days.... Then sent me on a wild goose chase saying my bank could fix it so when I called my bank they said they have no power over the bike company and when I called the bike company back they told me there's nothing they could do and if have to wait 10 days..... Worst service, worst customer service, DO NOT USE!!!!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,12/22/2013,"Definitely worth trying! They do a better job than I would have thought possible, and they are part of the cutting-edge worldwide in urban bike rentals. Some things are a little confusing the first time. E.g., getting your ticket to unlock the bike, figuring out the lock code (""aha, it uses only the numbers 1 to 3!""), locating the nearest return spot, etc. CB might benefit by using a 'focus group' of suburban elderly people who have never heard of them, and watch carefully and LISTEN to them as the old folks try to figure out how it works. If/when the old folks get stuck, this means Capital Bikeshare is not communicating well at that point in the process (via the signage or instructions at the bike racks) -- the problem is with CB, not with the old foks. :-)   (Not that the old folks are the main users, but they are a great source of candid reactions, whereas younger hipsters might not be willing to admit they are stuck -- but the small hurdles may prevent them from using the system.) That said, once you figure it out (and figure out how to locate bike racks near you to return to, and to check if they are full, etc.), it's a pretty cool system. A lot cheaper and faster than taxis, better exercise, a way to get some fresh air between meetings, see the city, etc. Recommended!"
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,11/08/2013,"Convenience of the service is great (as long as you can find a bike to check out and find a dock to turn the bike in). The quality of the bikes is terrible. Imagine cycling on a tank. Be sure to test your breaks- I have had multiple experience with screaching breaks and low resistance!!!The Capital Bikeshare customer service is also terrible. They are inconsistent in service- the first year, my account expired after a year (understandably and I had to renew). The second year, I was simply notified that I had been charge $75+ to auto-renew. I was never even given the option!! In fact, I had expressed previously that I did not want to renew! When I called promptly to cancel this auto-renew, the customer service agent was rude. Hopefully the credit will come through and I will have no further problems."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/01/2014,Cap Bikeshare only gets worse.  They run this like an old soviet supermarket. The city gave them public space to run Bikeshare and they know they have a monopoly and are indifferent and not very knowledgable about dc -- there is a slot at ct and mass 2 blocks away -- well no it is 8-10 blocks -- but whatever.  So ride there and take a cab backKind would be to call them smart ass idiots Ugh.
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/30/2014,"Reviewing as a tourist who loves to use these bikes to get around the city/surrounding areas on a nice, warm day.For the cost ($7/per day), the bikes are nearly indestructible, easy to ride, and easy to find. There are stations all over the city, particularly in the areas that you are most likely to visit (near monuments, museums, and restaurants).The accompanying smartphone app (SpotCycle) has a nice interface, and is easy to understand after a few minutes of playing around with it. I use the bikeshare each time I am in town - for $7, you can give yourself a tour of the city (just be sure to map out your trip to avoid the surcharge that accompanies a trip greater than 30 minutes!).Edit: Note that there is a review stating that it is $6 for 30 minutes, on top of the $7. This is patently false. For any ride UP TO $30, it is free (only the $7/day fee kicks in). So if you ride around town in 20 minute increments, you will spend $7. It costs $2 for any ride that is 30-59:59... but just find a station (there are plenty) to dock and undock. Some might find this to be a pain - I think it's part of the fun of the journey."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/21/2016,"Avoid using this if you can. Their docks often do not work and they make you scramble to find another dock elsewhere. Their customer service is entirely unhelpful and they do not know how to treat customers well. They charged me after their bike dock didn't work and they refused to come out and fix it or close my account. I followed all their instructions, called customer service and emailed them. They only gave me 50% back. I will be disputing the rest with my credit card and will be reporting them to visa for for poor business practices."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,04/21/2012,"I tried this bike sharing system as a tourist, and after a few hiccups, the experience was quite good. First off -- as others on Yelp have noted -- the pricing system is unnecessarily complicated, and if you have the bike out for 2+ hours, the fees can really mount up. Having that $101 temporary debit on your card, even though it's just a hold, can be a bit of a mental blow.  All that being said, the signage DOES explain the pricing system, you just have to spend a bit of time reading the small print. It would all benefit from better design (the signage AND the pricing system). I can imagine as a local this could be a good mobility solution - and it wouldn't be very expensive once you're a member and that's all locked in. Pulling the bike off the rack once you have entered the code is relatively straightforward. But if you're a runt like me, beware - these bikes are HEAVY so be prepared to put a bit of muscle into it. They're very solid, basic, 3-speed bikes, and I found it a little hard to control at first, much harder to steer than my hybrid bike at home. But you soon get used to it. Once you're up and spinning, DC is quite easy to cycle around in, and there seemed to be quite a few stations around the place where we could return our bikes. (Although it would be handy if the bikes had a little map or something that came with them, so you could find those bikeshare stops more easily.) I noticed some racks were completely full, meaning that there was no space to return a bicycle, which could be a pain if you were in a hurry to go somewhere."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/10/2016,"Rates are confusing and don't make sense. Very expensive and poor customer service. Not tourist friendly,"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/26/2012,"As visitors to DC we found Capital Bikeshare very convenient and fun.  It was a great and inexpensive way to get out and cover alot of ground around the monuments and the mall.  We stayed with the bikes the entire time which meant when we stopped at a monument one would have to ""guard"" the bikes since we didn't bring along a way to lock them up.  And for a tourist - it probably would be a good idea to use the bikes on weekends when there are less cars out on the road."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/30/2016,"If you are a visitor to the DC area this is NOT the company for you to rent a bike from.  This company is for commuters - that's what I was told when I called about the additional charges.  Their pricing is tricky and misleading, so if you pay for 24 hours, you still need to switch bikes every 30 minutes to avoid additional significant charges.  This is written in the very small print in a very unclear way so we had no idea we would get the extra charges.  The customer service people were very rude and acted like I should never have rented one of their bikes for a ""joy ride"".  I won't do it again."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,01/29/2012,"Have a yearly membership and will never get rid of it. Your options for getting around the city are: driving, bus, train, cab, and walking. If you're out drinking, driving is out. Bus can be infrequent and unreliable, the train only goes so many places, and cabs are expensive.But, if there is a CaBi station nearby, I just use my key, hop on, and get wherever I need to go in a matter of minutes. I use it for my morning commute to get from Columbia Heights to Farragut West in 15 minutes, which is usually shorter than the wait and ride on the bus. For those who wonder, the bikes are built like tanks, and the chains and all other fragile parts are covered. They're heavy and really, really hard to crash. You'd almost have to try. There's a sturdy basket and bungee cord in the front which I have carried comically large objects in before. The staff has been great lately in fixing bikes that have been marked for maintenance -- service just keeps improving.Lastly it is a healthy and active way to get around town, while being fun. Just remember: don't drink and ride, obey all traffic and biking regulations, and wear a helmet when you have one. DC has a ways to go but it's becoming a great biking city, and it's by far my favorite way to get around."

DC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/07/2016,Capital Bikeshare riders routinely create a hazard on sidewalks in the downtown commercial district. It seems that their website and signage does not instruct riders that it is illegal to bike on the sidewalks.
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/17/2014,"Here's my dilemma: I absolutely love this idea and have used it quite a lot. My gripes mostly stem from the operations. First, it took about 6 weeks for them to send me a key. Then, I go to activate it and it doesn't work. Ugh, what a bummer. Thing is, I have my own road bike and it's much easier (read: lighter) to get around in. But I like having this option when I know I shouldn't be biking home ;) That's why when I have to wait nearly 2 months to even use it, I'm annoyed."

They make it sound like it's $5 for one day unlimited and $15 for 5 days unlimited. BUT REALLY, they end up charging you about double that, because it is ONLY unlimited if you keep each bike ride under half an hour, which is not realistic. They don't make any of this clear at their kiosks and then when I called to complain they shamelessly said they couldn't do anything about it and didn't even express any hopes to improve their flawed system. This company gets far too much credit in DC, but really their bikes are clunky, their prices are inflated, and their business style is unethical... I'll stick to buying my own bike on Craigslist and saving MUCH more money long-term.***TIP*** They are not actually $5 for 24 hours riding as they claim they are, be careful with all their hidden fees!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/05/2012,"Bikeshare gives you more freedom in your commute. I work way outside of DC and it helps me replace one or two legs of my journey. I've been a member for just under a month and I ride Bikeshare pretty much every day, whether it's for getting to work or going to meet friends.The process is seamless - there's no locking up, just docking the bike when you're done with it. I've run into issues with a few bikes that seem a little beat up but are still rideable - I make sure to hit the ""repair"" button when I arrive at my destination so someone can service the bike. The bikes themselves are perfect for their purpose: large visible bikes with thick wheels that are easy to ride for beginners (though they'll definitely feel weird at first if you're used to riding a road bike, like me).Also - one of my favorite features - on the Capital Bikeshare website, you can check the stats about the most recent 200 (or fewer) rides you've taken on Bikeshare under ""Rental History"". Metrics tracked are distance ridden, calories burned, CO2 offset, and duration of rides. For each ride, you can see what station you started and ended at, plus the cost of that ride, if any. I haven't paid anything beyond the initial membership fee yet because it's easy to keep rides within the city under 30 minutes."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/01/2016,"Capital Bikeshare is such a great idea in theory. Rent two bikes for the day to ride around for only $16? Great!! HOWEVER, their pricing structure is completely misleading. The $8 to rent a bike FOR THE DAY is actually only for 30 minutes. After this you are charged in increments, bringing our total charges for the day to $124. Apparently you are supposed to return the bike to the dock every 30 minutes to avoid being charged insane fees. What sense does that make?! And why isn't it clearly stated that this is the intention? Had we known this we could have avoided the crazy fees. Not to mention that the bikes are crappy to begin with. I would have much rather rented a decent bike and paid a little more than this. Will not be using Capital Bikeshare or recommending it to anyone ever again."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/27/2011,"Before I get into what Bikeshae is and why it is amazing, lets talk about a few things it is not:1) Capital Bike Share is not a scam.  People who gave CABS a one star review because they didn't read what they were buying, go ahead and give yourself a one star review.  99% of other people didn't have that problem.  Please sit and reflect on your credit card usage.2) Capital Bike share is not for scenic day rides around the city.  There are plenty of places that will rent you a bike cheaply for the day.3) Bike share is not done.  Paris has approximately 20,000 bikes on 1400 stations.  DC's will likely never be that big, but that is 20x dc bikes, and 12x the stations.  Many of the issues Capital Bike share has been dealing with will disappear as the system doubles in size over the next year.4) Capital bike share is not mature.  Its been around for one year and it is already one of the best ways to get around the city.  Give it some time.Now, what Capital Bike Share is:1) Capital Bike share is the quickest way to get around2) Capital Bike share is two birds with one stone (exercise and commuting)3) Capital Bike share is just as good for tourists as locals.  If you want to see this city, bike share will get you around far faster than walking, metro and cheaper than cabs by far.In four months of Bike sharing, I have yet to pay a single usage fee.  Quite simply you can get almost anywhere in DC in within half an hour.  If not, stop at a kiosk and get more time.  Simple.I have noticed, however, that as the weather has improved, it has gotten more and more difficult to find either empty spots or available bikes depending on the time of day.  Clearly the popularity is driving the need for some infrastructure improvements.Finally, I can only hope that as more and more people bike in DC, more lanes will open, and drivers will stop trying to kill me."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/24/2016,"I used Capital Bikeshare thinking it was a glorious concept. It is a glorious concept. I, like so many others was duped and drained of money$. I understood fully that my membership allowed use of the bikes in...30 minute increments. Cool, just enough time to make it from on locale to the next. Set timer, and off we go. The reality (a brief version): BikeShare says the bike wasn't docked properly, you will be charged. Here is the SKU number go back to the other side of DC, where you docked it, and read the tiny SKU numbers of all the bikes to see if it's still there. Ride over in a frantic panic. Done. Not there.  Several phone calls back and forth. No help. Three hours later a voicemail from BS: ""The bike was returned after 20 minutes, you won't be charged.""  Why couldn't they have told me earlier?! Just opened my credit card bill and...surprise, I was charged. For two trips they say that were longer than 30 minutes. I call them and let them know, I set my timer for 20 minutes, the bikes were always returned within 30 minutes!! Speaking with Edna from BS I realize she is sooo blaze that she is used to getting this call. Not worth it! For the hassle and damper on my trip to DC I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before dipping my card. Don't dip with BS!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/04/2012,"My husband and I used Capital bikeshare for the first time last week. We found free street parking but it was far from Smithsonian so whatever we saved from parking we used on bikeshare. The instructions were pretty clear, $7 fee for 24 hours use and to prevent additional charges make sure the bike is returned to the next station within 30 minutes. We found the docking stations easily but a room for improvement is to maybe provide a GPS with the bike to be able to find the closest one. i know they provide maps but it requires time to look and figure out which station is nearest our destination. We just got lucky that when we needed to dock them we found one close to our stop.Will do this again when we go to DC. I hope that in the future they will include trailers so we can bring our kids, that would be a fun activity."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,01/08/2016,"Totally useless. Most of the times the racks are totally empty or totally full but when they're not, the kiosk is usually down. The customer service is horrific. It's obviously designed to take advantage of tourists. Avoid this and rent a bike from a reputable bike shop."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/13/2016,"Best customer service experience I've ever had. I was calling to get a refund because the code I was given at a bikeshare station didn't work and I was still charged although I was unable to use the bike. I called Capital Bikeshare's customer service line, an actual person answered the phone immediately and within 2 minutes I was given a refund. No automated answering machine, no getting passed around from person to person. Just very efficient and helpful service. Thank you!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,05/07/2016,"I used Bikeshare to get around town to various meetings during a recent visit to DC for work.  It was faster, cheaper, and more fun than taxis (I used it four times during my visit, paying $8 total), and more convenient than the Metro because I needed to get to places that weren't near stations.   The pricing makes sense for this kind of use.  What isn't up to snuff is the infrastructure. The touch screens are slow and finicky at best, and I routinely had to swipe my credit card several times before the system would recognize it.  As other commenters have noted, customer service is non-existent.  I give the system four stars because it met my needs perfectly, but there's lots of room for improvement."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,11/08/2014,"Love it as a tourist. Bikes are like a 98 accord, theyre unstoppable, ugly tanks. Lots of availability downtown and conveniently located. I like the rental fee structure too. Definitely recommend it for getting around down here"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/25/2014,"Awesome way to view the monuments.  Navigating around the people can be a bit annoying, but much better than tired feet at the end of the day.  The cost of the bike rental...a bit confusing, and the $101 holding fee per bike....sucks, but I understand the liability risk in lending the bikes.  When first renting the bike it sounds like you can rent the bike for 90 minutes for $8.  Then you see something that says a day pass for $7.  After that you have the first 30 minutes to use the bike with no additional charge...then it's $8 per hour after that.  You are encouraged to park and go along the way so you can forgo some additional charges.  We just rode our bikes for about 2.5 hours nonstop and it worked out for us.  I will definitely consider using this form of transportation next time I'm in town showing guest around."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/09/2014,We r out-of-owners and rented bikes here to tour around dc for an afternoon. Things were exactly as advertised. bikes were in great shape. only neg comment would be that we did not have helmets; it would be good if they could find a way to rent those as well.
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,06/21/2011,"Pricing model is misleading -- I would argue intentionally. Be sure you read the fine print before you rent.I used CaBi of couple of times in DC, noting the advertised membership prices for hourly, daily, yearly rates. Seemed like a deal at the time, so I paid $5 for a time-stamped 24 hour period. I was notified by the kiosk that a $101 hold would be placed on my card until the bike was returned, but that was it. I found out different when I got my credit card statement. Apparently, $5 is only for the 'privilege' of using the bike itself, then you get dinged a fee for each 1/2 hour of use.  Several of my colleagues were also duped. So, three rentals ended up being and additional $60-70 dollars for a couple afternoon rides. That kind of money could have paid for several cab rides with money left over for lunch.C'mon guys. I know the economy is tough, but duping people into paying more by intentionally misleading them on the purchase price is a low blow. As others have noted, this is a great way get exercise and it's emission free. We need more of these options in larger cities. Don't alienate people with bad business tactics before you've really had a chance to grow."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/19/2014,I rented a bike for one day for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised! It was easy to ride around ( I mostly rode around the national mall and monuments) but it was much better than walking all day. I'm glad it had a bell because some people are clueless when you're trying to get past them!The only problem I had was that I wanted to ride to a museum but the closest dock was filled so I couldn't ride it there. I guess I could have just waited for someone to take one out but that seemed time inefficient. It was kind or annoying to have to get out my credit card each time I wanted a bike but I guess that's the only way to do it without having a yearly membership.All in all I really liked renting a bike for a day. If you do it you have to get the app. I would have wasted so much time trying to find open docks if I didn't have the app so that's definitely a lifesaver.I think it's definitely worth a try for a day it was nice.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,03/22/2015,"My boyfriend and I visited DC for a few days, walking around to all the sights, but only managed to use the bike share once, which was a mistake on our part. When we visited the weather was pretty chilly, but I had my mind set to walk around the Tidal Basin. Enter Capital Bikeshare! We found a station near the Smithsonian Metro, followed the prompted directions, and we were on our way. While visiting the monuments around the Tidal Basin we were hesitant to leave our bikes unattended (they charge $1000 for a replacement!) so we ended up walking them around while visiting the MLK and FDR monuments. We got a few dirty looks from tourists, but we didn't care, it wasn't worth the risk of leaving them on the trail. When we approached the Jefferson Memorial there was a bike station available, so we turned our bikes in, did our thing at the monument, and checked out bikes again for the ride back! They charge per time usage, but the fees are pretty minimal when you compare it to the time you are saving and the time spent off your feet!Easy!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/02/2014,These bike share rental systems are the best thing ever.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/17/2012,"Not good ,not good.I've first time been d.c.I rent one bicycle form Capitial Bike Share.And they give me a receipt for 7 dollar daily.But couple days later, they charged me 61.00(totally charge for 4hours and 2min) and 101.00 security deposit(it will give me back).I am so angry.  They didn't show the price to anyone by their station.So don't rent their bike without their membership.they will charge unbelievable price from u not fat pocket."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/16/2011,"I love you Capital Bikeshare!  You're the one thing in DC that I'm really impressed with.  I wish I'd have joined sooner.Why?1.  You've got a station right outside my apartment and seemingly, in every other location I frequent.2.  You save me money, this is even cheaper than the metro or buying my own bike.3.  You help the environment.4.  I get a work out when I don't even realize it.5.  I was robbed while walking on the sidewalk a week ago, but I doubt that will happen again now that I'm zooming down the street! Ha!6.  The bikes are comfy and riding is just as fun as it was when I was 10 years oldTIPS: 1.  Try it for just one day, it will only cost you $5.  I was reluctant to try because I thought I hated riding bikes because all the other bikes I've ever ridden were always so damn uncomfortable.  2.  Actually, unless you live far away from a station and/or you are grossly out of shape, and I mean unable to walk up a flight of stairs you should just go out and get the one year membership.  It is only $75 dollars, you spend that kind of money on a Saturday night out with friends.  3.  The haters who are pissed about their extra charges aren't the sharpest tools in their respective sheds.  In order to keep this from happening just stop by a station every 30 minutes.  Dock the bike and check the same one out two seconds later for no extra fees then continue on your merry way.  It is pathetically easy."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/12/2013,"BEWARE!!!! They charge a $101 deposit on your card per bike rented. So if you travel with debit cards instead of credit cards and have a specific amount budgeted for your trip, you WILL have a hold that will screw up the rest of your trip."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/08/2015,"If I could give 0 stars I would.  My wife and I rented bikes from the Bikeshare. The kiosk you rent them from is horribly misleading. It explains the rates for renting of the bikes. On the kiosk it states $8 for a 24 hour membership. To anyone reading that, it would read $8 to rent for 24 hours. I rented 2 bikes and my wife and I rode them for under 3 hours each. Upon coming home, I checked my bank account and noticed a $16 charge and a $60 charge. When I called the company, they explained that the $8 was just to ""take the bikes"" and we couldn't use them for more than 30 minutes at a time. If we went over 30 minutes, there was ""overage charges"". When you rent them at the kiosk, there is a 233 page terms and conditions and the person I spoke with on the phone told me it explained the charges in there. My wife and I would have never rented the bikes had we known it would be nearly $100 for 3 hours. If the kiosks were better labeled, other customers would not have to be mislead in the future."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/20/2011,"My husband and I joined the capital bikeshare program back when it first appeared as smartbike, and it's been amazing, both for commuting around as residents of the city and for signt-seeing when we have guests.First, as a resident, you pay a low annual fee, and then you can take a bike from any station to any other station though out the year. You never get charged anything additional unless you take a bike for longer than 30 minutes - I've never needed to do this commuting around the city. Now that there are so many stations and so many streets have bike lanes, biking is often the fastest way to get around the city - I often imagine I can feel the evil eye from all the cars backed up in traffic when I fly down the bike lane during rush hour.For tourists, the bikes are also great. It's $5 for a one-day rental, or $15 for 5 days. After you pay that small fee, you can use the bikes just like a local. If you have a hotel up by Dupont Circle, grab a bike and the trip to the National Mall becomes a fun and quick coast downhill that lets you see more of the city and avoid taking the metro. We recently had family visiting who wanted to see some of the farther-away monuments - the Jefferson Memorial, Arlington Cemetery, and the Iwo Jima Memorial. This is a beautiful loop to do on a bike, with really beautiful trails along the river. My husband and I used our memberships, and our relatives bought one-day bike memberships. To avoid high usage fees, we made sure to stop at the bike racks along our route and check the bikes in every so often. (Prices go up the longer you have the bikes, but every time you check them in, your usage time goes back to zero, even if you just take the same bike right back out again.) We could have also opted to just pay the $20 or so in usage fees to keep the bikes, but since there are so many bike racks around DC and Arlington, VA, it didn't take us much time to check them in.(And to people who are giving low ratings because of the pricing system - it's written right on the machine where you put in your credit card - I'm not sure how they could make it more transparent...)"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/13/2011,"I've used bike share a couple of times now.  I thought some of the issues would be resolved after the program was up and running - like a restaurant staff that needs some time to work out kinks.  Today it seemed whatever could go wrong did.It's a 5 minute walk from my house to the bike stand on 14th. Perfect.One bike left, it's being worked on by technicians. Seems that the latch mechanism is not working properly and it wasn't locking to the station. They fix it and tell me it's fine. Away I go.Three docking stations I visited looking to park around 19th and L were full.  Called the 800 number and they found me a place to lock up but it's 6 blocks away. By this time I was 30 minutes late for the doctor. So after my appointment I go to get a new bike to ride to my office, but it says I already have a bike out and it won't give me a new one.Called 800 number. On hold for about 10 minutes, then it took them another 5  minutes to confirm that they had the bike and I was ok, and they would reset my credit card so I could take out another bike. Turns out, that locking mechanism never locked properly. By that time though I was dangerously close to late for an international call I had to be on, so I had hailed a cab.Told them I wasn't pleased and they apologized but offered no credit, no nothing.Bottom line - the system is ok unless you're up against a tight time squeeze.  I would not describe it as more reliable than Metro.  If your day requires you to actually be somewhere on time, skip the bike or use your own."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/23/2014,On Sunday I and my wife used this service for the first time. We rented two bikes and delivered them back less than 30 minutes later. However my credit card statement says I've been charged an extra fee of US$ 202. Is there any reason for that?
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/12/2011,"I love Capital Bikeshare! Just got a $75/yr membership and it is awesome! After doing some cost-benefit analysis, I figured Capital Bikeshare is more than worth it because it 1) Saves Money ($104/MONTH for the Metro vs. $75/YEAR for CaBi) 2) Time (I can go whenever I want, no traffic jams, don't have to wait 18 minutes for the next train or 30 min for the next bus), CaBi is also 24/7 whereas the Metro closes at midnight or 2 am3) Provides Good Exercise4) Environmentally Friendly5) Great way to explore DCHere's the pricing for memberships:24-hour $55-day $1530-day $25Annual $75Pricing for usage fees:0-30 minutes FREE31-60 minutes +$1.5061-90 minutes +$3.00Each additional 30 minutes +$6.00*Since there are so many CaBi stations all across DC and NoVa, it's possible to always have a free trip: just dock your Bike at a nearby station as your 30 minutes are about to run out, then take out the same Bike and go ahead on your journey. But most places in DC will take less than 30 minutes to get to. I have a Blackberry and the Mobile Spotcycle App could be improved (please include a MAP!) but it's alright for now because at least it has the names of the intersections. I'm really glad CaBi is expanding, I can't wait to see all the new stations! CaBi is pretty much already at all the metro stations, but it would be great to see them expand even further. Thanks Capital Bikeshare!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,01/02/2012,"Capital Bikeshare is great. It has changed the way I get around the district. I still take bus and metro, especially when I am carrying loads of stuff, but for a quick trip, CaBi is the way to go. I ride several times a week and I have yet to receive a charge beyond the initial membership fee, as I keep all my rides under 30 minutes. That's all it takes to get to most places inside the district. If you want to go siteseeing, there are a number of bike rental places who offer day-long rentals. I also love that you can go online and see how far you biked and how many calories you burned. Although there were some glitches initially, busy stations have been expanded and new ones are being added. I plan to continue my membership through next year. Go CaBi!"
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,11/22/2014,"As a tourist I used the 24 hour option for $7.  I had 2 major problems.  1) When I chose to have the code printed, the slip got stuck in the printer. Stupidly it didn't also display on the screen, and there is no way to ask it to do so when the printer fails. I got lucky when I asked for an account report to be printed. When I did that, the code came out (first). Whew.   2) I tried to use bike share again after 23.5 hours but the code failed. So warning! You do NOT get 24 hours, you get some unknown about less than 24. I was screwed since I really needed that bike and didn't expect the code to be rejected well before the 24 hour mark.  Other than those problems, the system is great. Lots of convenient stations with bikes and some open slots - and the bikes were in good condition."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/07/2014,"Can I give zero stars? I don't know who is running this show but he/ she needs help. This is a service that the DMV area definitely needs but this company is screwing it up by the numbers. The fragile, poorly made ""key"" they issued broke after about 3 months. Apparently this is a super common problem, to the point they had to switch vendors. When I called to inquire I was advised their ""system was down"" and to call again in a week. I called a week later and got same routine. Called back again and I was told in no uncertain terms that the key was being shipped. 2 weeks later I called when no key had arrived. The rep said no order was placed for the key. Lie #1. Speaking w her manager, bill Robbins, I was again assured it would be in my mail box in 10 days and they were putting it in the mail immediately. 3 weeks later I called back when no key had arrived and was told that my key was on back order. The rep said that when in last spoke with the other rep they had just received a shipment but my request wasn't covered bc of the enormous back log. Lies #2 and #3. Speaking w the manager, Deric McKinney, he assured me that this would be sent to someone/some department that could get me an answer as to when my key would be available to me. He said they are very good about it and I should hear from them in 48 hrs. It's now 8 days later. No word from capitol bikeshare. Lie #4. I understand that this is a new venture (kind of, minus boston, New York, Chicago, etc) but there is no excuse for this level of incompetence. If they can't get the keys made fast enough, fine, things happen. Big you cannot lie to customers over and over again w a smile. Or can you? They are really the only game in town. I have no real recourse. I am calling once more and then I'll be going to BBB. But that will just be on principle. There is nothing really to be gained. If you have the resources and space buy a bike."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/26/2011,COOKS! SCAM!!!! ROBBERY!  they charged me $92 for 1 day! Pricing guide very unclear make sure you read all the fine print.  PRICING VERY MISLEADING
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,10/18/2014,This is a phenomenal service (for annual members) with great locations and in my experience phenomenal/responsive customer service.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/14/2014,ITS NOT $7 rental for the day.Its $7 for stupid membership fee and free for first 30 minutes.After 30 minutes its $$$$ every half hour or 1 hour.So you end up paying $7 + usage/hour + etc.I ended up paying $58 for 2 bikes for 2.5 hours which i assumed will cost only $14 for me. Its almost costly as renting a car.Its a rip off.Take your own bikes.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/05/2015,"Horrible deceiving pricing. They charged me $56 for 3.5 hour trip. I have never imagined it can be this expensive. Stay away. When I called, they said since it is your first time use we can credit you $23, but still you cannot take this bikes for a measure stroll and I am not a tourist: I live in DC."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,11/29/2011,"Ok, so the bikes aren't perfect, but they are good enough for a fun ride around the NOVA/DC area. The perks are that they are conviently located, are 3 speed and have an adjustable seats. The negative aspects are they do not have adjustable handle bars, have large tires and do not have much grip on cement."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/25/2011,"LOVE Bikeshare. I was one of the 4687540723 people to pick up the deal when LivingSocial offered it and have only been inconvenienced a few times. I've rolled up to a couple full stations and have had to double back to further off docks (one up a pretty brutal hill) and last night my key inexplicably wouldn't unlock any of the bikes at Dupont Circle so I had to take another short hike to another dock. Really, a small price to pay.If you've got an Android powered phone, download Spotcycle. It's a nifty app that will locate the nearest stations and let you know how many bikes or spots are currently available. Boom, now I don't have to worry about riding up to a full station again.I wish the time limit before you have to pay was a wee bit longer so I wouldn't be pouring sweat as I bike across the city to work in the morning in an effort to keep my ride under the half hour mark, but that's just me being a complainer. Bikeshare is saving me a ton of money on metro costs and ensures I don't have to sit around waiting for a bus after last call when I go out. Also, you should check out my quads. They're getting pretty beastly. Thanks Capital Bikeshare!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/12/2011,I just signed up this morning after receiving my key and was so excited...only to find out that at around 8.30am when I was going to bike to work that THERE WERE NO BIKES AVAILABLE anywhere in Columbia heights or nearby stations...I mean what the hell!! Why would they have so many people sign up without having enough bikes available. So I was late to work.My first day experience has not been good and off course I have lotsta day in my 30 day membership without being able to use a bike to get to work.I think Capital bikeshare is a great idea and initiative but if it isn't dependable then whats the point!!Oh then I called them and was put on hold for ages...so had to leave a message!!!Not a happy customer...who knows maybe tomorrow I'll get a bike...but will keep my metro card with me just incase!!!!!
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,11/20/2014,"More than happy with this service. There is room for improvement, but they are doing their best and adapting. 24 hour call service and cans driving and relieving full docks all the time. It is nice to ride to work and all. As with everything in DC, you have to think outside the box, and leave early or late to beat the rush, or perhaps it is not for you. They are constantly expanding and adding more docks and bikes, so it is a great alternative to public transit or even riding your own bike. I'll be renewing my membership next year."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/08/2014,"Used the bikeshare on a vacation to Washington DC last week.  Got two three-day passes so that my husband and I could explore the sites.  On a three day trip, using the bikes two or three times per day, I got three different bikes that were mechanically defective.  As per the instructions, I found another station and checked the bikes in, pushing the maintenance needed button.  Annoying.Once I checked my credit card statement, I found out that we were charged $20 in fees on a $30 rental cost due to time going over the 30 minutes.  Having read the website on my phone, I had been counting on the pricing structure for overages that is included in the text.  Evidently, if you scroll further down, there is a much more expensive overage fee structure for certain types of rentals, including the 3-day that I used.  After almost 30 minutes on the phone with customer service, I finally insisted that the representative send me an itemized statement.  Evidently you can rack up $20 in fees for going over by 3 or 5 or 7 minutes on a few different trips.  I really don't have any desire to spend my vacation with a stop watch out to make sure that I don't go over some arbitrary time limit.  And having a fee that is 2/3 of the whole initial rental cost is nuts.  Plus, the fact that I experienced so many maintenance issues is evidently irrelevant.  The customer service lady told me that if I had called them, I could have gotten credited for my issues.  I informed her that I followed the instructions which stated to push the maintenance button.  Apparently, that doesn't count.Between faulty bikes (not to mention ridiculously heavy and only having 3 gears, making them incredibly slow) and the crazy fees for time overages, I will not be using a bike share again.  I'd rather just deal with the hassle of bringing my own bike and know that I can ride a mechanically sound bike and actually enjoy myself."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/25/2014,"This is my new favorite thing in DC.  I moved back here 3 months ago after being away for 10 years, and wanted to re-learn the city, especially since it has changed so dramatically since I last lived here.  After renting a bike for a day, I bought an annual membership.  It has been great!!   These bikes are everywhere and I literally have ridden ALL over town.  It makes me appreciate DC much more, now that I realize how many cool neighborhoods there are, including many that did not exist 10 years ago!  DC has changed SO much, and these bikes have helped me see the city, much better than walking or driving.  (It helps that most of the DC hills are pretty gentle)."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,11/08/2011,"AWESOME idea, GREAT webservice (they list your miles biked, calories burned) ... and I'm proud it's in my city. The only reason for the middling rating is because they still have a fair amount of work to do to smooth out the demand and supply logistics. We've stopped taking it because we can't be sure there will be an open dock at the other side, and it's not uncommon to have to spend an additional 20 minutes or more just circling around various stations, requesting more time and looking for an opening. This makes trip planning difficult, and we just tend to go for the safer alternative of the bus or car these days. :(   I know it's not an easy problem, but please find a way to fix this Capital Bikeshare, and we'll come back and be loyal customers!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,12/12/2015,"Kiosk barely functioned, bikes were too heavy for me to use comfortably, and as a fairly petite female I couldn't put my feet on the ground with the bike seat in its lowest position. What a waste. Haven't even looked at our credit card to see what the kiosk charged for this debacle, but I'm not optimistic after reading the other posts below. Better things to do with a beautiful weekend. Save yourself the hassle."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/12/2013,"I love it and love that they are always expanding! If you live or work in the city it really is faster to bike then metro or bus to many locations. It's not a total transportation solution for all situations, but it is for many. No I will not bike back from a big grocery trip or visiting relatives in the outer burbs, but what a great and fun way to get home from work! Yes I'm still terrified of being mauled by traffic but DC has gotten a lot better about bike lines, and if you know your route can also use back streets. Also most of the stops are close enough that if they are out of bikes, or full and you need to drop it back off can just look on the map and hit the next one. I love it, best 75 dollars spent for the year membership ever. But for cereal,  where a damn helmet and only use the sidewalks if you really, really have to. * shakes fist like the grumpy old man he is."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/13/2011,"Amazing. Why every city does not have this, I don't know. Rent it for 24 hours for chump change, and only pay for the time you use it. SIMPLE.One heads up, sometimes there may not be bikes left by the time you figure out to pay with the machine, have someone stand next to the bike you want, to sort of ""hold"" your bike while you rent it at the machine."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/06/2011,"Great system! Can't beat the price fir a 24 hour rental. $5 usdWell-maintained bikes, comfortable ride, easy to figure out system. Can't say enough good things.Will definitely use again"
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/16/2015,"After my experience with bike share in Philly, this was very disappointing.  In Philly, I inserted my card, chose one time use, and was on my bike 1 minute and $4 later.  Capital Bikeshare has terrible touchscreens that are hard to read (if they are working at all) and not enough locations.  The result was my husband and I walking around for 20 minutes trying to find a station with a functioning screen and two functional bikes.  After visiting 3 stations we finally gave up and walked.  (I know that you can check online for the amount of bikes in the station, but one of the bikes listed as available was broken and at another station a whole group took all of them at once.) The bikes are great, lightweight and easily adjustable. There should be way more stations around the national mall."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/09/2015,"We decided to try out the Capital Bikeshare program on a whim during a quick trip to DC this past weekend. We thought it was a great deal to be able to rent a bike for 24 hours for just $8. It seemed pretty straight forward until, as others have noted, we found a huge fee on our credit card. I read the info on their website and saw that it explained the fees after the first 30 minutes, but this info was not transparently displayed at the docks. Given that these bikes are partially marketed for tourists, I would think they'd do a better job of explaining the fee system on the actual docking stations. We didn't have computers over the weekend and weren't able to read more about how the bikes worked. We saw later that the ticket said we would incur a fee, but we didn't realize the fee would be so huge. The bikes themselves were well maintained and easy to use, but our experience was soured by what I've described above. I hope the Bikeshare program can create better signage to make it clear that the costs increase exponentially after the first 30 minutes."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/01/2013,"I had a year long membership and it was not a pleasant experience.  When I needed a bike, most of the time the docks were empty.  When I need to drop off a bike, the docks were full.  Keep in mind if there are not available docks, then you are expected to house the bike over night and then wait for the pick up truck.  Yes, when you pay for this service you get to work for Cap Bike share.  Methinks not."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,09/28/2010,"ok so this probably makes me a huge ditz, but I am hoping I'm not the only hopeful Bikesharer who misunderstood this system. Directions on the renting station were unclear and I bought a 5$ daily membership--sounds great, right? $5 to use the bike for a day...daily membership. I rode the bike to work, worked all Saturday, and then returned it, decently happy with the arrangement, even though the bike is a bit heavy and can be unwieldy at times. I like the concept and I appreciate the placement....Only to be charged a $101 deposit fee on my debit card (which I knew about and understood would happen/be returned to me) and then on TOP of that $75.00 for renting the bike all day! What about my $5 daily membership?Well, apparently the daily membership is a misnomer and means you can only use it for under half hour increments throughout the day, taking it out and returning it before it reaches the half hour point. Who does that?Anyway, probs my bad, and they ended up refunding my money after a confused call to customer service, but its made me a bit wary of trying CBS for a while..."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/23/2015,HORRIBLE customer service. This would not be such a big issue if there weren't such constant problems with bike stations and bikes.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,11/19/2010,"The mobile app ""SpotCycle"" now supports Capital Bikeshare! Use your smart phone to see live updates of the locations of nearby bike docks and how many available bikes/open spots at each one. Perfect!Special yearly membership rates are now gone ($50/year) and up to $75 a year, but still worth it."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,07/07/2013,"We were in town for almost 3 weeks and used the bikes a lot. We purchased the 3 day pass mostly (wish they had weekly instantly), but soon found out that you need to return the bike within 30 minutes before you start incurring additional charges. I didn't feel the need to drop the bike off at every monument and preferred to keep the bike I had, but apparently that isn't ""SHARING."" I downloaded the app to see how many bikes are available at each station but on a couple occasions, the station said it had 3 or 4 but come to find that they all had tags for repairs or there weren't any bikes. We would then have to walk in a complete opposite direction or just take the metro. There was also a time that the rack was full to drop the bike off. The bikes were clean and easy to use. The different gears came in handy for the uphill battles. Overall, I love the concept and if I was using it to run errands, it would be great, but not for long term use for joy rides around town."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/21/2011,"How did I live before bike share???? I think I've saved more money by not taking taxis, burned more extra calories, and generally have seen more of NW thanks to bike share! I've only had two instances where I couldn't dock my bike for some time, but I'm sure they are working on this problem! It's an excellent veture, and an amazing model in urban sustainable transportation! I hope it spreads, like a red 3-speed virus, across the US and world!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/29/2013,"Went for a one day tour of DC. Without these handy bike stations, it would have been futile and we would have been more tired than we ended up. We ended up using stations on H Street, Union Station, near the Washington Monument, near the Lincoln Monument, Rosslyn, and Georgetown. They are SUPER heavy but extremely handy. We had a blast!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/24/2015,The pricing is VERY deceptive.  They advertise $8 per 24 hours but will charge you an additional $22 unless you return the bike every 30 minutes -- or something.  I'm not even sure what the pricing is after looking at the website.  Anyways caveat emptor.
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/14/2015,What's the use when the bikes are never where you need them? The docks by my home are empty by 7:30 in the morning. The docks by my job are always full. This is not a practical way of commuting if capital bikeshare doesn't move more bikes around. For the price of membership (which seems pretty high to me) they should try a little harder to keep the stations half full/half empty so you don't have to scramble looking for a nearby station with docks.
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,05/04/2011,"I'm a MtP resident, and I finally activated my key from the Living Social deal this week.  I took my first bike ride yesterday....make that 4 bike rides, and I really loved it.  Took a ride from MtP down near the White House, down to the mall and around the monuments, and had a chance to test out the bike on all different surfaces, and it did well.  The bike is a bit heavy, so you may want to consider that before you try popping the front wheel onto a curb...and well, as a guy it was a bit strange not having a higher crossbar on the bike, because I didn't realize how often I used that to ""kick"" the rear end of a bike in a different direction when stopped.But all in all, I loved it.  I was riding mid-week from 7:30 to 9:30, and didn't really have any issues with stations being too full or too empty, and thus didn't feel very guilty when I checked in a bike, and then almost immediately took out another bike.The climb back up to MtP takes a bit of effort, but I'm hoping that also means that I'll often find an empty dock when I bring a bike back to the 'hood.  Yay Bikeshare!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/04/2010,"Haven't ridden a bike in, oh about, 15 years. But as a couple of my friends have recently bought bikes and I am on a new fitness plan, I decided to give the Capital BikeShare program a whirl to ride around the city and Rock Creek Park.Was a little nervous that the bike (which looked pretty sturdy) would be too heavy or very dork-ish. It took a second to get comfortable since its been so long since I've ridden but sooner than expected I was ready to tackle the bike paths in the street.I was happily surprised that the machines were so easy to use. It literally walks you through the steps of signing up for a daily membership. You pay your $5 (and they hold a deposit of $101 incase you damage or don't return your bike) and otherwise you pay a nominal fee for each 30 min increment. The first half hour is free.As for feeling like a dork, I didn't. Especially since I encountered several other riders with Capital Bikeshare bikes, all who either at least smiled and acknowledged me or even stopped to give information on good places to ride or their experiences with the program.The bike worked out just fine, the new bike paths throughuout the city made me feel comfortable riding and I passed at least 2 other racks where I could return my bike during my route.The only suggestion I have is that the website make it a little easier to find where the locations are. It would be great if you could type in a part of town and it showed all the Capital Bikeshare sites, instead of looking at one huge map of the city and having to figure it out.If you want a new form of exercise, need to run a quick errand or want to explore DC but don't own a bike, this is a great way to go."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/05/2011,"I've had a membership with Capital Bikeshare for about a year, and I'm very satisfied with my membership.  Though I may not use it enough to completely justify the $75 membership fee, having it as another transportation option has been a huge help and a great money-saver.  I'm sure I would get more use out of it if I had a smartphone.  Unfortunately, I have to check from a computer or the dock site itself ahead of time to make sure bikes are available at my check out spot and at my planned dock spot.  I find the locations to be convenient to where I'm departing and where I'd like to go.  I've only been dock-blocked once, though it immediately started pouring and I had a ride in the rain and a long walk back to my house in the pouring rain, I don't hold it against CaBi.The two things I wish they'd improve is to find a way to lock helmets to the bikes so you can check those out as well.  Also, if they could put some sort of lock on it so that you can temporarily lock it somewhere while you run inside on an errand, that would be enormously helpful.  I've started carrying around a cheap lock so I can lock the bike up while I run inside on a quick errand."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/11/2016,horrible horrrrrrrrible service. they say you have a 24 hour membership and then charge you for ever hour after 30 minutes. even worse customer service.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/25/2011,"Good for the environment and your health and easy on your wallet. Super convenient. The bikes are easy to ride from the street to gravel paths on the National Mall.  My husband uses CaBi to commute to work - from Logan Circle to Chinatown area - in a quarter of the time. I ride for fun - to Dupont, Georgetown, Eastern Market. Three tips:- Before you head to a station to pick up a bike, check the website to ensure there are bikes there, particularly during rush hour. There's an app for that. - Make sure to dock the bike 30 minutes after you check it out - otherwise it will start charging you. The $5 daily pass works all day, you just have to ""check in"" to a bike station within every 30 minutes. See the website for all pricing details.- BYOH. Bring your own helmet (if your head is worth protecting."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/10/2012,"The pricing model is very misleading.  As a first time user, it appeared to me that the cost was $7 for a 24 hour period.  Took the bike out for a nice 3 hour ride.  Next day find out I have a $45 charge AND a $202 charge on my card.  First I thought I had not placed the bike back properly and it had been stolen or something.  Then I call to inquire about it and apparently the $202 is a deposit (which I was unaware I would be charged for).  They said that would be refunded to my card in a week's time.  I'm glad I didn't use my debit card at least.   The $45 was apparently for the usage of the bike for over 3 hours (I was at 3:05).Anyway, I thought the whole bikeshare idea sounded great, and maybe it is better for folks who buy an annual membership, but their prices for taking one out for a day apparently are completely ridiculous, and the kiosk is misleading with it's pricing.For 3 uses of their bikes, I could buy my own bike."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/06/2013,"Great idea, and all the bikes I rode worked fine, but there were many, many stations that were out of bikes.  They need to do a better job of moving the bikes around so that the stations in the middle of the city have bikes.  Still, if you are here for a few days and like riding bikes at all you really should get the 3 day pass for only $15 and you will be amazed how much you can see."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/28/2013,"We use bike share every time we are in the DC area, absolutely great.  Easy, economical, comfortable, tons of locations, and the little bell is great too!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/28/2014,I would have given 0 stars if allowed. Never use this service if you want to catch a train at Union Station. They can't seem to find a way to keep spots open anywhere near the station. Makes the rental absolutely useless if you have to park the bike a mile away and walk back again. Just horrible.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,08/09/2011,"Amazingly convenient service. Provided you pay attention to how the rates work (and it isn't hard) this is a very cheap and easy way to get around town, even for tourists, especially for tourists. $5 to rent a bike for a 24 hour period, unlimited uses that day for free, provided the bike isn't kept out for more than 30-minutes. You can pretty much get anywhere you'd want in half an hour, and as long as you plan a little bit ahead so you know where you need to drop the bike off in relation to where you are going, it is very easy to get around on the cheap!"
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,08/25/2015,"Good in theory. Capital Bikeshare is only good if you plan on making short trips to a nearby metro station. You get charged outrageous overage fees is you use it for more than 30 minutes at a time. Also, the bikes are big and bulky. Considering how expensive this service is I would expect better bikes. Furthermore, the customer service could care less about their ripoff practices."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/17/2014,"The system is great for tourists like myself. I visited Washington for a day and riding the bikes around all the monuments was fun (haven't rode a bike since I was a kid). But what really made me give it 1 star was the holding in my account. I rented 2 bikes so I now have a $202 hold in my account, when I called I was told that they'll release the money from 5-10 business days. Who the hell has $100 or more to spare from 5-10 days?! This situation has created an economic problem in my life because of this nonsense. People beware, if you are willing to have from $101-$202 stuck in limbo for 5-10 business days then go ahead. Otherwise, stay away from this company."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,04/20/2015,"WARNING - if you don't return your bike every 30min they charge you another $7 - doesn't matter if the slots are all full. Customer service only knows how to read out of a manual and isn't much help! I love the idea, but it needs a lot of help."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,08/18/2013,"We love our capital bikeshare membership, but we've noticed an increasingly high number of dock blocks or empty racks. Extremely frustrating when you're trying to get somewhere and when time over a half hour is $$$. Suggest keeping more metrics on empty/full docks and times."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,06/09/2011,"Did DC in a day, literally, and couldn't have gotten my tourist fix in without these bikes.  The fiancé and I took the bikes all over the DC area.  They were easy to use and placed in convenient locations.  Any tourist looking for helpful transportation (besides the Metro) should try these bikes out.  Tip: the bikes do not come with locks so if you want to leave it outside while touring one of the museums, bring locks.  Other than that it's great way to tour DC!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,04/18/2011,"Wonderful program!Good:-Handy Smartphone app named Spotcycle-Good number of stations in DC-Bikes have three gears, adjustable seat, and front & rear lightsBad:-Limited stations west of Rosslyn (e.g. Court House and Clarendon)-30 minutes go quick, especially when using for exercise-Some difficulty with some stations having available bikes or available docks, but this has gotten markedly better in the last couple months-The map on their website and on the app list bike stations, but could be clearer on which direction they go (DC streets often only have one bike lane that goes one direction)Future: (Looking bright!)-More stations across DC and MD-Expanding stations to Northern Virginia along Wilson Blvd-HOPEFULLY more bike lanes"
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,05/10/2012,"Used Capital Bike share for the first time last week. A friend and I had some free time before the Nats game and decided to bike around the city after seeing their website. Now, we had read the fine print about the prices and fees and knew it would be a tad pricey, but we were ok with that (cheaper than drinking and eating at a bar all afternoon, plus the exercise!). We biked for about 3 hours and covered about 8miles around the city and loved that we could dock our bikes right outside the stadium before the game. What I *WAS* annoyed with is I never saw anything about the $101 hold they put on their card. (Yes, I did read their website and the pricing guides at the docking station. Maybe I missed it, but it would have been VERY tiny print as I read everything when trying something new).Also, the next day, I emailed the company and told them what a great time my friend and I had - basically what I said above in the first paragraph - just gave them and their service a glowing review and said we'd most defaintly be back. What was SHOCKING was I received a reply email, that yes, stating how grateful they were for the nice review, but...and then went on a very very long rant about how we didn't understand the purpose of their service and how they weren't meant for recreational rides and how we'd be charge for the 3 hours and blah blah blah. (Again, my friend and I had calculated the amount it would cost us and we were FINE with the price. We were in no way disputing that). I just found it rude that after trying to give them praise, I was informed I didn't understand their company and used it for the wrong purpose. (Again, please show me on their website were it says their service is ONLY for commuting and not intended for recreational biking around the city). If they want it only to be for getting from Place A to Place B, they should only allow the bikes to be out 30-60 minutes AT THE MOST, to prevent senic biking. I love the idea of biking around the city, but I'll be researching other companies the next time I do this."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/14/2011,"Ask, and you shall receive!  The day after my last review - and every day since - CaBi shuttles have been moving bikes during rush hour to keep bikes available where they're needed, and docks available on the opposite end.  In response to other members and by monitoring demand at various stations, they've been installing additional docks and adding bikes to the system.  Several new stations are slated to open shortly to accommodate the growing membership and better cover the city.  Their staff is friendly and responsive, and it's a wonderful way to get around town!Thank you, Capital Bikeshare!!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,01/01/2013,"We had a lot of fun on the bikes and it was a great way to see the city. The bikes were easy to find, and easy to ride.  I appreciated that they had built-in lights.  The key is to dock your bike every 30 minutes to avoid getting usage fees that add up quickly, and finding an open space could be hard in popular spots.  Download the app to help."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,05/05/2015,"It's great to help me get too and from places fast, and I have an annual membership.  But the service can be either great or terrible depending on who you speak too.   Like tonight I had to call a few times to get help when the dock I was returning my bike to didn't work.   The first woman I spoke to was incredibly rude, but her supervisor was a huge help."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/04/2013,"I wish I could give them zero stars.  They charged me $94 for a 1 hour bike ride.  When I called to complain they told me that I had rented the bike for 8 hours.  Nope.  The best customer service could do for me was credit me back half of the price.  So I paid $47 for a 1 hour ride.  There is no way to get a receipt when you return the bike, and obviously their computer system is seriously flawed.  Unless you have a lot of disposable income, DO NOT rent from them.Total scam and huge rip off."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,11/09/2014,"It is a great option for seeing the monuments as a tourist. The downside is the smoke and mirrors billing! It is clearly advertised that you can rent a bike for $7 a day/24 hours. It is not so clear that if you do not bring the bike back within 30 minutes you are charged overage fees. Suddenly your $7 deal is no longer a deal! Why would I want to have to bring my bike back every 30 minutes while going for a long ride, i.e. touring the monuments? The only upside is my bill was cut in half after calling to complain. Obviously their hope is that you don't check your credit card closely. Shady..."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,04/10/2011,"I'm giving CaBi five stars because it's great for the very specific way in which I use it: to get to DCA in the wee hours.  When I'm trying to catch a 6AM flight and the first Metro doesn't run through Columbia Heights station until 5:20, I'm stuck with Supershuttle or a cab for $20+... or I can take CaBi for free.  I walk over to Lamont Park to check out a bike, ride down to the Mount Vernon trail, and park in Crystal City.  Then I walk about five minutes into DCA and that's that.  Takes about 45 minutes.(Just a couple of warnings though: I would make sure I know the route to the airport well.  And the LED lights on CaBi obviously weren't meant to light up a dark trail... but it works.)There's not a lot of room to carry luggage, but I travel with a suitbag that I can carry on my back, and sometimes I bring an extra bungee cord to strap small bags to the little front rack since the existing ones are pretty short.  I haven't tried to take a larger bag with me yet, but if I do I'm thinking I might try to affix it to the saddle rails like a big saddlebag.  Overall, a great solution for Metro's early, early morning shortcomings."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/19/2012,"If you're doing a recreational ride--make it short & sweet!My husband & I decided it was a pretty day & we wanted to spend a day outside. We decided to rent the little ""red bikes"". I have been in the DMV area for less than a year & we currently do not own our own bikes, so we saw that Capital Bikeshare had the most docks & that the website actually shows you how many are available at each dock. What the website does not tell you--which I can as being misleading--is the fact that it's $7 for the first 30 mins, but there are additional fees for the extra time & there is a $101 deposit per bike...for us, it wasn't a big deal...we originally planned to go from 10th & constitution to Georgetown, but after we saw the price, we decided to change our ride to around the national mall & see the MLK memorial. We never had intentions on biking all day, so the 1.5 hours was perfect for us & still an inexpensive, fun way to tour DC. Definitely not meant for long rides. Would do it again...We plan to buy bikes but until then, Capital Bikeshare works for us!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/05/2012,"A rental system that doesn't work. If you want to rent a bike more than once a day, you have to deal with their ""technical glitches"" frequently since the codes they generate don't work all the time. Then when you call customer service, they are quick to tell you it is your fault. That you probably didn't enter the code in time - I think I can handle punching in 5 digits in less than 5 minutes. Horrible customer service. A faulty system. Don't use it."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,05/20/2014,"A great concept, but there are still a lot of issues that need to be worked out.  I bought a year membership after the bike seat on my own personal bike was stolen.  Yeah.  Apparently that's a thing now.  Anyway, my plan to bike home from work every day was squashed after I realized that bikes in Tenleytown run out right around 5 p.m. almost every weekday.  So, I have a yearlong bikeshare membership that is pretty much useless.  They often run out of bikes or docks, so it's very unreliable.  The closest docking station is at least 1/2 a mile away from me, and I live in DC.  Everything being said, this is a great option for tourists or people wanting to take a very short, casual bike ride (i.e. not having to worry about timeframes, like having to get to work at a specific time, because you have to factor in the possibility that you might have to take the bike to a further docking station).  If you want to take a ride longer than 30 minutes, just dock your bike and get another and you shouldn't be charged."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/11/2012,"I have been a member of Capital Bikeshare of almost three months now. I loved it at the beginning.  Within a few weeks, I realized that they were unable to address problems being reported, which mainly related to lack of paring spaces in the morning when I needed them.  All four stations near my office were always full.  I called and wrote to them several times, but no improvements were seen.  These days things have become much worse.  In the evening, all the bikes are gone and I cannot find one to ride home.I feel so sad about such a promising idea and promising business.  Their execution is so bad that it does not serve the purpose of those who need the service."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/07/2012,"Love the concept and really enjoyed recent rentals in DC however 2 challenges. First! I could only rent 2 bikes per Visa card. I am glad I happen to have a 2nd Visa or would have been out of luck. The biggest problem is the credit card bill, I have been overcharged on both Visa statements by 6 times the correct amount. Had to dispute with both cc companies.  Poor business model if this is the taste they leave in their users mouth. Watch your credit card statements!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/06/2011,"Although I think there system is pretty good, the customer service reps are complete CROOKS!  I bought a yearly membership thinking I could use it the day I purchased it.  I called before I purchased to make sure this was accurate.  Over the phone they told me that although the yearly membership would not activate for a day or so, I could buy a daily membership and they would just reimburse me.  Great!  So I sign up.  After I received my yearly membership token, I called back customer service and asked them to refund me for the 2 times I used it before I received the token.  They completely balked at refunding me.  The customer service rep even told me that I was a liar!!  What?!?  I asked to speak to his manager, he said OK, then put me on hold for 10 minutes before disconnecting me.  I called back and he kept hanging up on me when he found out who I was.  I couldn't believe it!  I finally called a few hours later and got someone else.  Although the second person was a little nicer (and I stress the word 'little') he still told me that the initial customer service rep I spoke to was misinformed and they would not be reimbursing me.  Again, I asked to speak to a manager and he put me on hold again.  He didn't get me a manager, but said they would review the initial call and get back to me.  A week later, they still hadn't gotten back to me so I called to follow up.  They told me that the first rep I spoke to was misinformed and gave inaccurate information. Eventhough it was their fault for not training their customer service reps properly,  they would not be refunding me.  Essentially telling me ""our bad, but sucks for you"".  So yea, it was only $10 I lost.  But seriously, take responsibilties for your employees.  They have a pretty good rental system, but they are 100% mismanaged and don't know how to conduct themselves in a business atmosphere.  Be wary when contacting them and make sure to always get the name of the person you talked to."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,06/27/2012,"I am an avid cyclist and recently became an avid Capital Bikeshare supporter. I have the annual membership and I think it's super convenient. The bikes are tanks, they weigh a ton, steer like a boat, and are probably indestructible. The gearing is pretty terrible. I only use gears 1/2 maybe 5% of the time. I often use the bikes to go to and from work. I also will hop on when I see one conveniently located and I'd rather bike than walk. It can be faster than metro and is much healthier!It loses one star because it is DREADFUL when there are too many bikes or too few. I tried biking from Chinatown to Farragut Park on a Friday afternoon and all the stations were at capacity near Farragut. I had to go on a wild chase to find one that wasn't, which added an extra 15 minutes. It's also horrible when you arrive at an empty station. These two problems can't be remedied too much by the company itself, its just one of the problems with a system like this. But, I do wish they'd create larger stations so ease this problem. If every station were 20+ bikes I think it would be better than having multiple small ones in a few block radius. There are tons of stations around DC and VA. They are fairly close and easy to dock/check back in. As an urbanite I love this service and hope they keep expanding!"
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,09/10/2014,"I live in Baltimore and am now commuting to Georgetown. I have driven it twice and, after the last time, NEVER again. Basically, the drive is 4 - 5 hours of my life I will never get back. I think I sprouted 10 new grey hairs for each 15 minutes that I was in the drivers seat. So I got me a MARC train pass and a metro card (thanks to the homeless guy who helped me figure this out since metro staff were nowhere to be seen). The metro drops me off either at Dupont which is a 20 minute walk or at Foggy Bottom which is a 15 minute walk. It's been fine and even enjoyable to get a walk in both before and after I spend most of my day with my seat in a chair. But I also spend a lot of time after the MARC train (getting into Union station) getting to my office. I saw a lot of people doing the City Bilkeshare thing while I was walking and figured I would give it a try. So far, except for day 1 where my GPS wasn't working and I saw parts of DC I am almost sure I will never see again, this has been a success. My advice would be to:1) Check out how many bikes and stalls are where you want to start and end up around the times you want to be there. If there are no bikes, or no stalls, I might think twice2) Get the Spotcycle app (I have it on my S3 but thinks it's available for iPhones as well). This allows you to find stands while you are out and about. I searched for Bikeshare and it wasn't clear that this was the app you needed. 3) Have a back up plan. I know that I can always use Metro if I need to. But so far that hasn't been an issue.The process is easy enough. I signed up for a one month membership (which I plan to expand to a year long one since the cost of the month is $25 and the cost of the yearly is $75). I received my ""key"" within a week (sent to my house). The print on the key was small so when I signed in I needed to get my kid to read me the numbers (can you say Mr. Magoo?). I used the key (it's easy to figure out how) the next day. You need to yank the bike out of the stand (and watch out for the pedal), adjust the seat (it helps to remember the height of the seat so you can set it the next time you grab a bike before you start your time), get on and away you go. I didn't bring my helmet the first time (shame on me) or bike gloves but have each other time (I am riding my bike to Penn station and locking it there in the mornings so I have that stuff with me), and was glad I did. People who don't wear helmets don't value their heads.I found four docking stations near to where I work (it really helps to have a few in mind although I have, in three tries not found this to be an issue) and all I did was push the bike in hard, wait for the light and I was done. On the first ride (getting lost) I logged in over 30 min - my fault and I knew I would pay a little over the membership cost. On all subsequent rides I have kept it to under the 30 min mark which means no extra charges.Are the bikes super? No, they are three speeders, but they get the job done. Is this the best program for tourists? No - it only works if you know you can ride for under 30 min, park the bike, do what you need to do and then grab another bike and repeat. If you want to keep a bike all day to see the sights, rent a bike from a shop. Will this work for everyone who commutes? No, but if there are bike stations near where you need to go and you don't mind deal with traffic (some DC streets have nice wide bike lanes and others just sharows) it might make sense. It takes some planning. The cost is such that even if I use it just a few times a week for the month (or less if I get the yearly pass) it is going to pay off in terms of not spending on the metro. And if I can keep at it I might be in better shape. All in all, thumbs up."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/16/2013,"So unlike most people, it seems, I actually read the pricing structure BEFORE I rented.  And knew that if I wanted to use this service it would be for commuter, short trip biking in between things I wanted to do, in less than 30 minutes each trip.I also downloaded - BEFOREHAND - a free app to ""helpfully"" tell me where bikes and docks would be available.In addition, I parked my car in a garage also near me and the starting kiosk that is comparatively fairly inexpensive, but at which you have to commit to prepaying for the number of days you'll be there - there's no ""in and out"" after you park, or you forfeit what you paid up front.  But these bikes are obviously reliable, right?  I see them all over, so they must be...In reality, this was the worst experience I've had in a long time that I got to actually pay for the ""pleasure"" of.It started off well enough.  At the bike rack next to the Washington Hilton there were plenty of bikes, and the kiosk worked perfectly.  Low humidity, unseasonably cool temperatures, yet the sun was shining.  Paradise.  Everything went so smoothly, in fact, that when prompted to pay 7 dollars for one day or 15 for 3, I thought why not I'll go for 3 days.  I've already parked, and this visit I don't want to have a weak moment and hail a cab or take the metro but commit to the health and frugality of bikeshare.  I get the first bike, ride to the West End Cinema, and have just enough time (because I'd also used the Flixster app to check running time, added 10 minutes for trailers, and thus calculated exactly how much time I needed afterward to grab a bike for the return trip and ride back to be on time for where I needed to be afterward - I am nothing if not prepared and organized).So I come out of the movies, check my oh so ""helpful"" bike share app, and see that at the same rack next to the theater there's one bike.  Great.  I only need one.  I swipe the card, get the 5 minute till it expires code for the dock, check.  Walk to the dock, and try to enter the code...  Doesn't work.  The code was 32212 I believe.  The ""3"" button, even if I pressed it very rapidly, sounded like a keyboard key stuck in the down position, and would make a tone audibly much longer than it should.  After the tone would finally end, I would try to press the ""2"" key...  Nothing.  No response at all.  Pressed the ""2"" over and over.  No change.  Finally just to press SOMETHING to maybe jimmy this broken piece of equipment out of its stuck state, I'd press the ""1"", only to get the ""uh oh, you messed up"" tone.  I repeated this process about half a dozen times before finally giving up.  I now realized I was going to be seriously late getting back to where I needed to be.Checked the ""helpful"" app again, and a few blocks away at L and 25th a kiosk had 17 bikes.  Can't go wrong there, right?  I literally race walk, panting and sweating, to the kiosk, while I call ahead to say I'll be late.  I then get to THAT kiosk and...  the entire touchscreen is completely dead!!  Of course there are 17 bikes - no one can get ANY of them!  Does the ""helpful"" app tell you that?  Of course not.  Why alert people of broken docks and touchscreens?  Just tell them there are bikes there, then let them find out they can't actually GET those bikes after they schlep on over.I then go with ""plan C"", hail a taxi, ride in the back of a hot, clangy cab with a surly driver - ah, paradise - and end up after tip paying him 15 MORE dollars.So after paying 15 dollars to ""bikeshare"" (yeah right) as a frugal option for 3 days transportation, thanks to the complete worthlessness of their equipment, after my FIRST 15 minute trip, I get to pay ANOTHER 15 dollars for alternate transportation!  I could have kept my car out of the garage and DRIVEN for less!!  15 dollars for ONE 15 minute trip...  That's a ""bargain"" in someone's world?  At Bike and Roll I can pay a few more dollars for an ENTIRE DAY, and when I come out of something like a movie have that bike waiting for me - right there.  Not 12 blocks away (if I'm lucky enough to get there and find THAT kiosk and/or dock actually works).  At Bike and Roll I also typically pay even less because most of my DC visits are a week or more, and they give you a price break on multiple days.NEVER AGAIN will I waste my time on this ""bikeshare"" nonsense.  And when I'm passing people on these stupid red bikes on the Mount Vernon trail, far from a kiosk, on one of my weekly Bike and Roll bikes (or better yet a completely free bike when I'm staying at a Kimpton hotel), I'll laugh in their faces for being dumb enough to have not checked the pricing structure and instead just go out pedaling around all day long to get hit with those big fees afterwards.  It's obvious only mindless sheep rent these idiotic red bikes, when there are much better alternatives available."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,12/17/2014,"Not only do I love using their bikes around town, they are also an AMAZING group of people who provide outstanding customer service. I am truly happy to be a member of such a stand-up service! Thank you!"
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/04/2011,"Having lived around here my whole life I've seen DC go from a hellhole to one of the best cities in North America. Capital Bikeshare is just the icing on the cake. I'm not a member, just use the $5 daily option when I don't have my bike with me. Despite the protestations from a few reviewers below, there is no scam here. If you keep a bike out less than a half hour there is NO charge. You could technically keep the same bike out all day as long as you locked it back into a station dock every 30 minutes, and got a new code from the machine. The bikes are nothing to write home about, although they seem quite sturdy. They are 3 speeds, with bell, lights and a basket. They are heavy, and I wouldn't use it if I was going to go cruise Beach Drive on a weekend, but for Point A to Point B city riding they are perfect. I would highly recommend you get the Spotcycle app for your phone if you're planning a day of Cap BikeShare. The app updates in realtime and lets you know how many bikes and available docks are at each station. It also has list and map views of all stations."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,09/02/2014,"I've seen these in other cities but tried it for the first time in DC while on vacation with the family. What a great way to get around! Biking is the ideal transportation in DC since the sites are pretty spread out and it's relatively flat. We had a trouble a few times where there weren't enough bikes or docks for our group of 4 but we managed. Also, 30 min goes by faster than you think so we went over a few times (still cheaper than renting a bike for the day though). Download the app Spot Cycle for locations of docks as well as real time info on availability. Definitely recommend!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/03/2012,"Capital Bikeshare provides a convenience for people wanting to get around the DC metro area. That's the advantage of the company. But it's run by a shady, pure evil, fiercely for-profit company with a pricing scheme that's intentionally vague and extremely punishing. Capital Bikeshare is a borderline scam. I was visiting a friend in Washington for the weekend and signed up for the all-day pass, for $7, and went on a weekend ride for a few hours, but got charged almost $80. I'm sorry, but $80 is totally outrageous for a few hours of riding a silly bicycle. That's enough for me to rent 2 cars for the day, and for Capital Bikeshare to buy themselves a whole new bike! They're making a killing off of suckers!When I called them to ask why, I got put on a long hold, then talked to a rude and unhelpful employee in a loud room who could do nothing for me. When I asked to speak with his supervisor, he actually refused, then relented. When his supervisor came on the phone he told me he'd been listening in to the call and could only offer me a 50% refund. He was extremely rude and sarcastic and refused to pass me up to their actual managers. They must get complaints about this all the time.There is something like 147 pages of fine print that you could read on the screen at the stations if you're into that. Even their homepage is intentionally vague about this and you have to go to their pricing page to figure out what they mean. No one just walking up to their stations on the street would be able to figure this out unless maybe they spent 2 hours reading the fine print. They rely on this and are completely inflexible for poor suckers like me who just wanted to go for a bike ride. So, moral of the story. If you do use Capital Bikeshare, make sure to fully understand the punishing price scheme in advance. And God help anyone who somehow runs afoul of the pricing system or has some sort of pricing error. They will not understand your cries for mercy!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,09/05/2012,"We rented 3 bikes not far from the Martin Luther King  Memorial  a couple of weeks ago. As visitors to DC we found  Bikeshare very convenient and fun.  It was a great way to get out and cover a lot of ground around the monuments and the mall.  When we stopped at a monument one  person would have to stay with the bikes since  there are no bike locks or any  way to lock them up.   Like a lot of the reviews I was also shocked at the pricing techniques used. The pricing system is unnecessarily complicated for a reason. Our entire party read the sign and pricing structure and apparently none of us interpreted it right I was surprised to see the extra fees on my credit card the next day I understood that there would be a deposit hold of $101 so that was not a big deal. Nowhere and I mean nowhere did it state that our two and a half hour ride would cost an additional $30. Thank goodness we did not stay out longer. The whole concept of riding to the next station  within 30 minutes seems unrealistic to me. We cycled all around the Mall and did not  even see another docking station. I understand that for the people who use this system all the time Bikeshares fees and practices seem very clear . I guess these bikes are NOT for leisurely use but this particular docking station is located exactly where the tourists are and there aren't any kind of office buildings or businesses around so it is obviously not there for the commuters.This being said Bikeshare was a lot of fun, I don't know that if we had figured out how much it was going to cost in the beginning that we would have rented them still. 5 stars for fun 1 star for misleading pricing."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,07/04/2015,"This all started off good, bikes were nice and it helped us tourists to get to the Memorials quickly. But then things went ""downhill"".  When we were done and had to get going to the airport we couldn't find a station with 2 open spots so I had to go a mile out of our way to find somewhere to drop mine. We had paid our $8 each at the terminal and thought we were all done once we turned the bikes in - until we got our credit card bills with an additional $38 charge. When I called to ask what the hell that was for I was told you have to re-dock the bike every 30 minutes to avoid the outrageous fees. Who has time for that? I got my fee reduced but not waived, as they felt it was my fault for not understanding this and that $46 to have a bike for 3 hours that I thought would cost me $8 was okay by them. The way the website is laid out seems to be intentionally  misleading, stating ""Membership and Usage Fees"", with a chart below that clearly shows ""24 hours = $8"", ""3 Days = $17"", etc. but you have to scroll down to see that usage fees are listed  - and charged - separately. In doing some further research I've also found that the company has received $16 million in government subsidies as it is supposed to be helping low-income people commute and maintain employment, but that's not how it's being used. This company is clearly looking to make a big, fat profit off anybody who doesn't read and understand the convoluted rules - while also taking our tax payer dollars. They won't get a dime from me again unless this stops."
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,09/14/2011,"It was fun, but there is still a $200 hold on my acct 3 days later. Not cool. I know it's my bank but it's lame!"

DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,05/24/2014,"I love riding Bikeshare. However, Bikeshare needs to hire customer service reps who can understand and speak English.

DC,1,Negative,Yelp,05/22/2012,"The only part of this that is convenient is that they are expanding so much, so there are docking stations in a lot of great places. But the annoying outweighs the good so I will not be using there bikes again. They placed a $101 hold on my credit card account and when I called Customer Service, they told me it takes 3-8 business days to clear. When I asked why I was told "" Because a technician needs to go out to the station where your bike was parked to make sure there is no damage""That makes NO sense. There was a person at the docking station in Logan Circle who literally took the bike right after I docked it: so how would a technician be able to make sure I did no damage? How will they know if it was the person after me or the person after that person? It was a line of BC and I don't appreciate being fed that kind of bogus information after I was charged $29 dollars for 4 hours, with an additional $101 being held on my CC.I will not recommend this to anyone but I will recommend that they get onto craigslist and get themselves a used bike...it would cost about the same."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/30/2011,"I think the idea of Capital Bike Share is really fabulous.  However, on my very first ride, I experienced problems at both ends of the return trip - there was no bike at the dock to use to ride home. After I waited 10 - 15 minutes for one to return, I rode back to my point of origin and found the dock full.Since this happened, I've seen the dock empty on 3 occasions (which would have been at about the time I would have wanted the bike).  For a great idea to be truly great, it has to work!  I was charged a ""service fee"" for canceling my membership so my miserable experience the very first time I used the system cost twice as much as a one-day rate would have cost.  and I had read all the fine print first."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,08/28/2013,"As others have written, it's a great way to get around, but not very practical to use during rush hour (particularly weekdays 8-930).  I rarely see bikes avaliable in my area when heading to work, and the few times I do see them, I sometimes have to go way out of my way to find an open bike slot downtown, adding 20-30 mins to my morning commute.  EDIT:  I recently up-ed my review to 4 stars.  They have gotten slightly better during rush hour, and the metro has gotten much worse in the past year, especially during non-rush hours.  Even with few available bikes during rush hours, they are often the best option in town for getting around."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,10/18/2010,"Capital Bikeshare is not ready for prime time. I am a huge supporter of shared bike programs so I hate to give such an awful review, but I have had repeated problems returning bikes due to a lack of stall availability. Using the bikes to go downtown is the transportation equivalent of ""Musical Chairs."" I joined Capital Bikeshare about 3 weeks ago. I have used the bikes in the morning (9 AM to 10:30 AM) on several occasions between Woodley Park and the K Street corridor, Dupont Circle or the West End. Almost every time, I found no stalls open for return of the bike at my destination. In many instances there were no stalls available at adjacent stations and I was forced to ride to an distant station to return the bike, which obviously defeated the purpose of my usage. I have reported this problem to Capital Bikeshare staff, but they been unable to solve the problem (by increasing the number of stalls or temporarily decreasing the number of bikes in the system). I'm getting a refund & waiting until I see evidence that the problem is solved."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,07/28/2011,I love bikeshare.  It is easy and quick.  If they can get the kinks of full stations or empty stations (one when you need the other) worked out then it will be perfect.  I have often found myself walking to 3-4 stations to pick up a bike even when the app says there is one available.
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/20/2013,"These are AWESOME!  We rent bikes in every city we visit.  This is a great way to see DC.  Very convenient.  You do need to use the smart phone app so you can find the locations and know how many bikes there are - spotcycle.net.  The bikes are in great shape, they have flashing lights on the front & back.  They do NOT have helmets nor locks, so you can't stop and sight see unless you can find a bikeshare location to leave them.  Also tricky - you could leave them and come back to no bikes (hence the need for that website).  We used them for 3 days and visited all of central DC, monuments, Georgetown, Rock Creek Park, Adams Morgan/Dupont, the zoo.  You can't go wrong!  The cost is $7 for a day, or $15 for 3.  Use of 30 minutes or less is free, but only $2 for an hour."

Pros: More bike stationsCons:  I can only use it 30 minutes at a time! So if I have to go from Waterfront to Dupont Circle, I have to switch bikes in between or else they'll charge me for going over 30 minutes! That just wastes my time.PLUS, they make it impossible for me to bike quickly to make it in time without switching bikes because the bikes are SOOOO heavy!!!  You really get tired out quickly!  I feel like I'll have the thighs of a soccer player in a week!

I'm not too cool to occasionally stop at a halfway point to check in and check out when my ride is going to require more than the 30 minutes.  Bikeshare is amazing.  Their maps are easy to follow, their Spotcycle app is always accurate, and their website keeps a really fun tally of al your travels if you want to know just how quickly you made it from U Street to Dupont on a day when all the traffic lights were green for a change and I wanted to make it to the red line metro without a 20 minute hike. The National Mall is also a far better site to visit when admired from a shiny red bike. Who needs to hike the 3+ miles from end to end when you could do that full loop to spend time at every major monument in just an hour and spend the rest of your time having fun around town?  Every other city should be so lucky to have one of these too."

I was just there visiting and used the bike share on my own and also part of a tour with some of the engineers who are improving the bike lanes, etc. in the region. It was super easy to use and the bikes are awesome."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/08/2012,"I love capital bikeshare.  Yes, there are some issues but it's an awesome addition to DC.  While I do not use it to commute, it is great way to get around DC especially if there is not a direct metro or bus connection.  For example - I take it from U St NW to H St NE and it's the fastest way.  While it cannot be guaranteed, it works pretty well.  There are a few places that need more docks to increase density but as it become more popular I hope that will no longer be an issue.  I love it when I'm out on a Bikeshare bike and I see 10 other people on the bikes and we smile and nod at each other.  One thing that would be great is if they had a listing of important bike laws in DC such as riding on the sidewalk being illegal in the central business district.  I've had to call customer service and they have been polite and helpful to me.  When my family rented bikes when they were in town, they found the details concerning prices (increasing per half hour over the first one) to be pretty straightforward and not hidden from view.  I'm uncertain how people who read the whole thing on the station don't realize it's not just a $7 rental which would be ridiculously under priced."
DC,5,Positive,Yelp,05/20/2013,"What could possibly be better?  You can ride these bikes FREE for up to 30 minutes and then just dock it at one of their kiosks.  You don't need to lock it up, maintain it or worry about it at all.  Daily monthly and annual memberships work for almost everyone."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,08/06/2011,They expected (without informing me) that I dock in the bike every 30 minutes!  Is it practical to dock in every 30 minutes in the first place?!!!  The charged me bucks for every 30 minuets WITHOUT informing me!! WTF!! Their price model is fucked up! MISLEADINGGGGGGG...... It come out more expensive than renting a car...WAY MORE!! I HATE THEM!!
DC,3,Neutral,Yelp,01/20/2012,"I love the concept of this program and I enjoy using the bikes as transportation.  I would have given an overwhelmingly positive review if not for one thing: after I signed up for a year membership and paid $75, I found out that I can't ride a bike until my key shows up in a week!  I called customer service and asked if there was a way around this, whether they would give me a code to unlock the bikes for the next week, and they said no.  So even after paying for a year membership (that I believe starts as of the time when I paid the $75), I have to keep paying the short-term rate if I want to use a bike.  I am very disappointed and wish they would be more clear up front about that."
DC,4,Positive,Yelp,10/12/2010,"I tried Capital Bikeshare tonight for $5 and upon returning home signed up for a $50 year membership.  The amount of stations makes this an excellent choice for city transit, and you never have to worry about locking up and storing your personal bike.  The only thing preventing me from giving this service a 5 star rating is the 30 minute time limit.  I live/work in DC and attend school in Arlington, so I'd like to be able to make that ride occasionally without having to pay extra.  Still, a great service that I imagine will become very popular!"
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,04/15/2014,"BEWARE! Renting a bike from Capital Bikeshare is much more expensive than what you think it will cost you from reading the display sign on the machine.  $7 is for a stupid 'daily membership' (whatever that is) and you'll be charged by the 1/2 hour after the first 30 minutes for use.  The way CB prices their rentals is absolutely misleading, especially if you're a tourist.  Absolutely no one will stand there to read 106 pages of the rental agreement on an electronic menu screen the size of an iPhone when you have a huge line of people behind you.  I was charged over $50 PLUS the $7 membership fee for about 4-5 hours of use.  You will NOT be paying $7 for 24 hour use.  CB can get away with basically just listing $7 for a 24 hour share (which highly misleads people into thinking it will only cost them $7) because more likely than not, the true cost of the rental is buried somewhere in the 106 pages of rental agreement on the electronic menu screen.  If this were a company that didn't try to deceptively market their rentals, why don't they simply state in big letters and numbers on their machines that bike rentals really cost $10-15 per hour?  The level of deception feels like almost borderline illegal.  You are better off spending 10x less on a metro pass to get around DC rather than rent a bike that will cost you more than $50 for a few hours.  Even a cab is probably cheaper.  To put this in even more perspective, my brother and his wife were also with me when we decided to rent bikes; it cost $101 to simply rent a bike for the both of them for a few hours.  Absolutely shameful and a massive ripoff."
DC,1,Negative,Yelp,06/29/2012,"OK so I gave Capital Bikeshare a terrible review a few days ago. Basically, I said the pricing model was a joke. They grossly overcharged me and then the customer service representative was  a jerk about it on the phone. They finally agreed to cut my bill in half and I look at my account today and they are charging me for more service that I never engaged in. I would stay away from this company. Do not use your personal debit card or credit card. This company seems to have no idea how to serve a customer."
DC,2,Negative,Yelp,10/29/2010,"Being new to the area, I signed up for the program because it was a green option and a convenient way to get around the city, or so I thought. While there are many stations interspersed throughout DC, I think a few more racks are needed- one closer to the Georgetown University campus and the Judiciary Square or Union station would be nice.As for the bikes...In general, I find that commuting to an office or making a trip to the store on them is inconvenient at best. The black basket(?) is a joke- it doesn't really fit anything except for a narrow bag or briefcase. Why didn't they put some kind of rack on the back if there was not enough room to do so in the front? On the plus side, they are sturdy and durable. Moreover, if you choose to travel at night, the light option is a nice feature. However, if you have a bag to place in the small basket(?), the light is almost completely covered which defeats its purpose.  As for the ride itself-- I'm a petite person and I find it VERY clunky and difficult to maneuver esp. around  pedestrians. And for me, the seat really needs to be lower than the 1 option. For an annual membership, I also think it would be nice to have more than 1/2 hour free. Certain docks seem to fill more quickly than others.Overall, I think this is a great idea, but improvements are needed.  Although I want to be supportive of such an effort, I have to admit I'm a little disappointed by the program and would probably not recommend it to a friend."

It was my first time using the bike so I waited for the light to turn green showing it was docked.

Customer service was not understanding at all and would only refund 50% due to \"User Error\". I asked what else I should have done as a user to make sure the bike was docked and the representative told me to wait for the green light. When I explained that I did wait for the green light, the representative told me I was not correct because their system did not show a green light. Now I am out $70 through no fault of my own with no good faith full refund or credit from Divvy's customer service. As a first time user of this product, this is no way to build a customer base.

      "So I got my first Divvy bike with a 30 mins pass to get to university. The bike was not bad I just had to adjust the height of the seat. Some people said that the bikes are heavy and it is hard to ride them. Well they are not entirely wrong. The bike was heavier than usual and it only had 3 gears so you could not go very fast with it, but I cannot say that it was very hard to ride, it was ok.I got my pass via the Divvy mobile app. You can download it from app store and google play. I am going to be honest with you, the app officially sucks! After refreshing and reseting multiple times I was able to get to the page that gives the pass. After paying the fee the app gives you a code that you enter on the keyboard next to your chosen bike and the dock releases it for you. Then a timer appears on the app that counts your riding time. You can also buy passes at the station but I should warn you that they do only accept credit cards (no debit cards or gift cards).There is a map on the app that shows you where is each station and how many bikes and empty docks it has. When you wanna get a bike you touch the plan a ride button on the app. Since it is 3$ for only 30 minutes you have to be careful and plan your ride ahead and make sure there are empty docks at your destination. When you wanna return the bike you just have to take it to an empty dock and push the bike forward until the dock grabs it. Then a green light appears that means the bike is successfully attached. Be careful if you do not put back the bike correctly you could be charged for a very long time. To make sure, you can refresh the app and the timer on top of it disappears. To sum up, I think that this is a good service that still needs work, but if you are looking for a healthy and cheap way to get around I definitely recommend it.\n",

      "While in town visiting for the weekend, we rented two bikes so that we could ride with our hosts. There are many locations, in popular spots, so pretty convenient for us. One can rent with just a credit card, or by using the app, while creating an account, which is easy.The first rental went fine, although checking the bikes in was questionable, as the kiosk was offline when we went to rent again. While on hold to report the issue, a technician arrived and rebooted the kiosk. We were then able to take bikes out. The bikes are comfortable, and very sturdy (also heavy), but with three speeds they were fine for the bike path near Lake Shore Drive. Overall a pretty good service.\n",

      "I want to really like this service. The idea is fantastic and I'm sure the teams involved worked very hard to implement this. Let me start by saying that the bike I rode was smooth, the experience of riding in Chicago was both exhilarating and satisfying. I highly recommend giving it a try and I hope they remain in service for a long time to come. Today was the first day that I attempted to buy a pass and ride a bike. I bought my pass using the app, located the nearest dock, followed the process of keying in the code to unlock the bike, the lights first turned orange and then green. I put my hand on the handle bar to pull it off the dock and it stayed put. No matter what I tried I could not take the bike off the dock. I realized that the bike never unlocked for whatever be the reason. I looked the FAQs in the app, there is nothing there about troubleshooting unlocking a bike (code correct but dock didn't disengage lock) I called their call center and was on hold for 10 minutes, in the end I did not get to speak with anyone. The app displays the unlock code only once, I could not use the code to unlock a different bike. You are made to provide your phone number and email address however the code is neither emailed to you nor texted. Neither could I purchase another pass. It was all very frustrating, the app just displayed the time elapsed, calories, start point end point. I headed to the kiosk and purchased another pass with the intention of appealing for a refund at a later time. With the new code in hand I successfully unlocked a bike and tried to key in my destination in the Divvy app in order to point to the closest dock to my destination. Lo and behold there was a button at the bottom of the map \"Unlock Bike\" I don't know whether I'll be able to use the loaded pass for my return trip but I will try and see. I wont need a refund if it works. There needs to be better instruction, troubleshooting, the user experience of the app definitely needs a little more thought and improvement. Will I rent another Divvy? Absolutely and so should you!\n",

      "Ok, I had 15 people in our group. You can only take 4 bikes out under one credit card. So you will have to use multiple credit cards if you have more than4 to rent.Also, use the divvy locator app to find stations close to where you are and how many bikes are there. So when you want to turn them back in you have to find a station with enough empty spots. Kind of a challenge with a large group. And we had problems at the first station because there were two defective bikes that we couldn’t release from the stand. I ended up calling the customer service line three times and visiting two stands before getting all the bikes. The touch screen at the kiosk was hard to use (screen couldn’t read our button pressing). And once you pay and get the code to release the bikes you only have 5 minutes before it expires. Some would take the code right away and some you had to enter several times before accepting. If you go past 5 minutes you have to re-dock all the bikes and start all over. AND if you plan on taking a nice leisurely bike ride on the Lakeshore Trail, forget about it. There are way too many people that apparently are training for the Tour de France or something because they are flying around at top speeds, yelling at you if you aren’t accommodating them. I had 13 year olds and even though it said you had to be 16, they were fine on these bikes. Easy to ride even though they are well-broken in at this point. Great idea and value but you may need lots of patience.\n",

      "My wife and I were looking forward to using the Divvy bikes along the lakeside in Chicago. I downloaded the Divvy App on my phone having first checked it would be possible to hire two bikes using the same debit card. We successfully secured the first bike however when I tried to unlock the second bike I was presented with a message saying I couldn’t have a bike at this time. After numerous attempts we tried to use the kiosk but the payment was rejected. I used three Visa cards including an American Express Card. All were rejected.Eventually, I called a number that we found on the App (the telephone number shown on the Kiosk was alpha numerical so would not work in my phone). I’m sorry to say the gentleman I spoke to after a very long wait was super dumb. I explained very clearly and on numerous occasions what I had done but he was unable to think of a solution other than putting the one bike we had successfully hired back into the docking station and starting all over again (I tried this without success). Eventually after 15 minutes I suggested we try a different docking station and rang off. The next docking station was manned by a young women. We explained our problem and she said she did not know why the app would not work for the second bike. She did however say that the kiosks do not accept cards issued from abroad. Can you believe it! When it comes to payment processing the US has always been behind other parts of the world (e.g. chip and pin).She kindly offered us the second bike free of charge. A good solution for now but not for later on in the day or on future days unless we bumped into her again. I have to assume hiring two bikes on one card cannot be done with an international card. We had a great time cycling on the lakeside. We cycled for many miles in a very safe (car free) and beautiful environment. Come on Chicago. We’re not all American you know. You should be trying harder to encourage more tourists to your beautiful city.\n",

      "We loved these bikes and found them very easy to use. It was a very hot day and after attending a craft fair we didn’t want to walk any further. A bike ride along the lake seemed like a relief from the heat! On a whim we purchased the 24 hr pass! We were hooked! In those 24 hours we ended up seeing much more of the city than we intended! We rode to Lincoln Park, Wrigley Field, the Bean, Zoo, Navy Pier, Willis Tower, Field House, Art Institute, Soldier Field and several museums. The bike paths were easy to navigate, we saved on transportation and as a bonus had a mini workout!The paths were pretty level and the bikes have gears to help the small inclines we encountered. A few days later when we had to get to our boat ride at the pier, rather than taking an Uber or Lyft, it was easier to get another 24 hour pass. We were at our destination in 10 mins! After dinner and the boat ride we picked up some bikes and rode back to the hotel. The bonus being the next day we were able to enjoy the remaining time on our pass!There were bikes available at all locations, some of which had friendly staff on site to help. The bikes were sturdy and well maintained. There are plenty of spots to pick up and drop off!This made our trip and would recommend it for all ages. \n",

      "We were in Hyde Park to visit the University of Chicago and wanted to go Downtown for a day. Divvy Bikes made that possible without needing to take the CTA or the Metro or the South Shore Line, all possible alternatives. The day was beautiful and we were able to ride along the Lake Front from Hyde Park to the Art Institute. Once we crossed the outer drive at 55th street using the underpass, it was beautiful riding with no traffic lights and no cars. Time for an easy ride, about 35 minutes. Divvy Bikes was easy to use for a full 24 hour duration that allowed us to get on and off downtown as we pleased. We had a little trouble at two docking or parking spots where the codes did not work, but we managed to get it straight within a few minutes (by replacing the two bikes we took out and then starting over again for the three bikes that we needed. I recommend biking around Chicago from Hyde Park to downtown. Bring your own helmet.\n",

      "First, please ignore the one star reviews that say \"it isn't clear I have to return the bike in 30 minutes\". It's right there on the machine when you dip your card in, so there' s no \"scam\" going on, just folks who don't take the time to read the instructions. The new fare structure has a $15 \"explorer pass\" which allows you to take the bike out for up to 3 hours without re-docking, There's also a $3 option for a single 30 minute ride. They keep adding more bikes and stations, so the system keeps getting better.\n",

      "Got a Divvy bike across from the Hilton Chicago. Checked out their bike program first online, then hit the streets. $3/30 min with credit card. If bike is lost or stolen, then $1200 charge. Easy to find other Divvy racks to dock your bike. Make sure the green light is lit before you walk away from bike and check the area you want to bike to, to see if there is available dock for your bike. 3 speed bikes with baskets. Chicago isn't the most bike friendly town, so you'll be dodging peds. Overall, I really liked using this program for my visit to Chicago.\n",

      "Loved the concept of this! Being able to cycle from place to place and return your bike so no worrying about locking it to anything. This was great as visiting from the UK means we obviously couldn't bring our own bikes! The bikes were heavy but were easy to ride. I think we had 4 or 5 different bikes throughout the day, generally all were in good condition with the exception of the last one. Chicago by bike is a good way to go and this concept is brilliant.Bikes were hard to get out of the locks and also at times hard to put back in again!Would recommend using these though as made us be able to see alot more of the city on our short trip. \n",

      "I got the $9.95 day pass. I was billed $102 because I either didn't see or understand their rental policy requiring you to check in your bicycle every 30 minutes. I had the bike for 22 hours. I had problems checking the bike out and when I called support they had to reboot the station software twice before I was able to check the bike out. During this frustrating period I didn't see any contractual obligations to check in the bike every 30 minutes.When I complained about the billing to customer service they reduced my fee by $50 which I found to be unacceptable. I disputed the charges with my credit card company and they honored my contention and in the end I was only charged $9.95.If you're unfamiliar with the Chicago Metro area Divvy's 30 minute check in requirement and the fallibility of their network may cost you more grief than the convenience of their bicycles.The bikes are 3 speed and are generally suitable for typical short recreational/commuter rides.Their fee structure and use policies need to be more clearly stated and printed on your receipt and at the rental kiosk.\n",

      "Many places rent bikes for $10/hour. Divvy is $10 for the day as long as you swap out the bikes every 30 minutes. It was easy to do. We picked up the bikes along the water from by millennium park. We biked south along the river, swapping out at McCormick Place. Then we went to the Museum of Science and Industry. After a few hours we took bikes from the station in front of the museum and cycled back, swapping out again at McCormick. It is a fantastic dedicated path,not near any cars and very well maintain\n",

      "Chicago has some great trails to ride on and also see the sights Especially along the lake. These bikes are decent to get around. Mind you if you are avid rider you should rent a real road bike but these are truly just a bike. They are decently maintained but as one review said the fees can add up. I thought i was getting charged $10 for the day but ended up at $17. You really need to only go from docking point to docking point because they are only allotting you 30 minutes-at a time to ride before extra charges kick in. I know people in my home town that just go to the next docking point under the 30 minute time then take the same bike out and go to the next stop. Still would rent them again but you need to know how they charge.\n",

      "The Divvy Bikes look like a good option but there are pitfalls. The price is right, there is no doubt. And, the bikes are in good shape for the most part. But, be aware that the cost can escalate if you are not careful. The $9.95 will cover numerous rides of under 30 minutes for the full 24 hour period. However, that means you have to renew the bike in under 30 minutes at one of the stations. If you do not, there are additional charges. We had problems with finding a station within thirty minutes and, on one occasion, finding a station with empty slots to renew our bike. Make sure you choose your bike wisely before taking it out of the stall. A few have soft tires, many are greasy and some seats are better than others. You use your credit card to rent and renew the bikes. We used one card for 4 bikes. But, that required that we all stick together so we could renew our bikes. Of course, we didn't think of that so occasionally went our own way. That created problems since our daughters could not renew their bikes. The time penalties are cumulative and can become costly. We found the thirty minute renewal time was not adequate. So, it is your choice to try to stay within the thirty minute renewal or ignore that requirement and pay the price.\n",

One downfall is having to check in at a divvy station every 30 mins. Sometimes we went over. But the fee for going over isn't too ridiculous, so it was still a good bargain and great fun. Bikes are simple to operate and ride. Just watch out for the bike commuters. They are traveling with a purpose, frequently faster than motorized vehicles; they are not out for a leisurely ride.

      "While riding the Ferris wheel on the Navy Pier, we decided to get the bikes and we went to the divvy website on our smartphones and got a $2 off coupon code. It's been a week and I have gotten no junk email from divvy, so that's good. For $10/day plus fees and tax, you get to use the bike for up to 30 min bike rides at a time at no extra cost. With the coupon code, my total was $10.50-something. Then there is a sliding scale for the length of your ride: 30-60 min is $2 extra, etc. but as long as you dock the bike at a station by 30min per ride you are not charged extra. Using the bikes for transportation along the boardwalk(?) on the water nearby the Navy Pier worked well for me, my teenage sister, adult sister and uncle. We had no extra charges for leasurely riding from Navy pier to Belmont. We were all thankful for the 3 gears that you can easily change on the right bike handle for going up and down the little inclines along the path. What a beautiful invigorating ride! The seats are adjustable and the ride is comfy. I don't usually ride a bike and my butt wasn't sore like it is after riding sometimes. I was able to strap my purse and water bottle on the front handlebars with the attached bungee-type cord and my belongings stayed secure.\n",

      "DO NOT USE DIVVY BIKES. I swiped my card and agreed to a $39.98 payment for supposably a 24 HOUR RENTAL that we only ended up using for two hours!! This was not the case! Supposably you are suppose to \"check in\" every half hour, (which was not listed on the machine, nor was it listed in an email). Like I said, we used the bikes for TWO HOURS, THREE WEEKS AGO AND I JUST GOT CHARGED $170 TODAY. This is a scam for anyone and everyone that is not local and I'm sick to my stomach about it. When I called customer service I rudely got hung up on the first time, and the second call they told me they would refund half ($85) but only refunded me $65!!! I have a manager that is suppose to contact me in 24 hours so we will see how that goes. Had the instructions been more clear, we would've gladly paid the $6 additional for each bike for the additional 60 mins like its stated on the website. They had no right charging my card for a transaction I did not agree with unless the bikes were lost stolen or damaged!!! I filed a dispute with my bank, which I hardly doubt I will get my refund because visa has to take it to them to dispute and they are going to take that $170 that they literally pulled out of their butt, and say it's for a misc charge like they told me. I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN AND I ADVISE ANYONE AND EVERYONE TO NEVER USE THEM AGAIN NEITHER!! IF I WANTED TO OAY $170 FOR PETAL BIKES I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT FOUR BIKES THAT WE COULD HAVE USED FOR MUCH LONGER THAN 2 HOURS!! What a scam. \n",

I see that some people complain about the 30 minutes, but it was never a problem for us. We rode from the Feild Musuem to Lincoln park and made it within 30 minutes. You will have no trouble. If you use the app you can ask for an additional 15 minutes to find a spot to dock your bike. It really should be no problem. If they didn't have people lock up their bikes, they would end up leaving it outside of restaurants/ stores while they shop. If it got stolen then you would be charged $1,200 The only way to prevent this would be to have bike locks on the bikes themselves. Seems more complicated that way.\n",

      "We liked the idea of these bikes that we saw all over the city, though in practice they were a little harder to use. You can only use them for 30 minutes before you get charged a fee, and it is a challenge to get the bikes out, get on the path, and get them back to another station within 30 minutes. An hour would be much more appropriate. In addition, we had to search hard to find a station with enough bikes for our family at times. The app was very helpful in finding the bike stations. We will probably not use it again, because of the challenges and the short length of time, I do not feel we got our money's worth. But if you are traveling solo, and know exactly where you will return your bike, it may work better for you. For a family riding on the Lakefront trail, you would be better off to rent from one of the bike rental shops in Millenium Park or on Navy Pier. \n",

      "I enjoyed Divvy. The bikes were well-maintained and in mostly decent locations. However, there are several issues you should be aware of in advance. 1) The TRANSIT app is awful. It is difficult to locate the nearest Divvy stations -- so you can drive 10 minutes looking for one. They aren't accurate and the app crashes more than any other app I have had. AND-- even drivers couldn't tell us where they are located. Thankfully, one gave us 2 off the book bikes until we found another station!2) The time starts rolling as soon as you get your bike. In a few cases, we unlocked on, then it took 2-3 minutes to get the second out. That time counts against you.3) At night, the stations aren't lit, so we drove around for 45 minutes just looking for one! (hence an overage charge). The bikes are great and hopefully the app will get better with time. I would do it again, but now I know where they are all located.\n",

      "We took full advantage of our 24 hour rental (noon-noon) -- we used it over two days since it starts your time once you purchase a pass. Although the 30 minute limit is a challenge/slight inconvenience it was peanuts compared to paying much more for full rentals. There are so many bike stations throughout the metro area it's nearly impossible not to pass by one to re-up the 30 minute slot. Made getting through the city a breeze and allowed us to make incredible time to see more than we thought we could! Not all roads have bike lanes but the sidewalks are oversized which made riding them there safe and not a nuisance to walkers. PRO TIP: the 30-minute time limit is their money maker. Avoid paying extra by downloading the Transit App from smartphone App Store and buying a pass for Divvy there. This allows you to immediately get your unlock codes on your phone. Best part -- you can re-dock your bike and IMMEDIATELY get it back (or a different one) for 30 MORE minutes without paying overage. Sounds like a hassle, but because of how many docks there are it is very easy. Without doing this you could end up paying $102 for a single day rental! \n",

      "The $9.99 for an all-day pass caught our eye and my daughter and I decided to use the Divvy bikes to ride along the Lakefront Trail in Chicago. We got the first bike off the rack with no problem. We had issues with the codes provided for the second bike and it took us about 15 minutes to successfully unlock a bike. We ended up using the bikes for almost 5 hours. We loved Divvy bikes until we got home and saw a $156 charge on our credit card! I called Divvy only to discover that we did not understand how the all-day pass works. You need to use the bike in 30-minute intervals. You have to return the bike to a Divvy rack, located throughout the city, within 30 minutes of acquiring the bike! The pass gives you unlimited 30-minute intervals - maybe good for a Chicago commuter, but not ideal for a tourist. They were unwilling to negotiate the charge at first. After a threat to dispute the charge with my credit card company, Divvy agreed to a one-time 50% refund as a courtesy. Since the rental charge at another bike rental company would've been $40 per bike for all day, I was happy with this agreement. Be sure you understand the terms of the all-day bike pass!\n",

This was really helpful when I arrived at the bike station. When I saw the line at the machine to pay I smiled and walked right pass to my choice of bike. Yes!!!The bikes were nice and easy to use. All the ones I saw were in good condition. However, I do have 'one' issue that will prevent me from using the program as a family outing again.The 30 minute time limit is too constraining to put it nicely. When starting, I would have to set a 30min timer on my iphone and watch it every so often as time passes fast. After 20 minutes expired, I would have to gather the family so we could find the nearest bike station and stop. Seems easy, but try that when you separate from your family. Ugh!!! If there's a way to avoid the 30 minute requirement, (without paying the extra fees) I will use the bikes again. If not, then I'll pass.\n",

      "Bought 24 hour pass. Had lots of nice rides. About 6 hours into my 24 hours, the station I was at would NOT give me a bike. Code from app did not work. \"Pass not Valid\" So I tried the process through the terminal at the station. Did not work there either. Tried to call and customer service not available. Soooooo, my wife put hers back too and we walked. When I got ahold of someone later to ask for some credit on my card, I was told that they DO NOT GUARANTEE YOUR ACCOUNT WILL WORK. So you are paying for a pass which they reserve the right to deny at will, whenever. Divvy -\"You should have called the help number on the terminal, they would have told you to try another nearby terminal\"Me - \"I did, but customer service was not available\"Divvy - \"Well you should have tried to call more.\"SO, even though the terminal said \"pass invalid\" it really meant \"pass invalid at this station for unknown reasons but you can get a bike at another \" and I would have known that if I had made multiple customer service call attempts.\n",

Not practical to even ride along the lake and find a station to dock at in 30 minutes. So disappointed. When you call they are not helpful at at and kinda rude! Beware!\n",

      "I have read the last couple of reviews below and i can't see how by them not locking the bikes in correctly is a fault of Divvy? It has very clear instructions in the FAQ's stating that if you don't get a green light on the dock, then remove the bike and try again. The docks are not perfect because i saw people time and time again just slam them in and walk away without checking, I giggled to myself as i imagined their bank accounts emptying as well. My wife and i used the system for one day with 2 passes and didn't have a problem, always checked for the green light, sat in the shade to have a rest then grabbed the same 2 bikes and commenced our next 30 minutes, setting a timer for 25 minutes and using the App to locate the next docking station. We'll be using the bike share in Washington DC and New York as well.The unfortunate thing is that common sense is not so common these days!!A great system, even a couple of Aussies had to explain it to a few Americans.......who would have thought?\n",

      "If you are a tourist visiting Chicago, do NOT use divvy. I'm a Chicago native and rented a 24 hour bike pass just to commute to work. I had never used the service before. Unfortunately when I returned the bike 20 minutes after renting it, evidently it \"didn't lock properly\" even though I was physically unable to remove the bike from the lock (I checked). Because of this, I was charged $80 for the time it took for an associate to notice the problem, even though I had returned the bike within the 30 min period. For reference, the annual pass is $99. I was so disappointed with the customer service and the exorbitant fee Divvy charged, especially when the name of the pass (24 hour pass) is extremely misleading for tourists. I would not recommend this service under any circumstances, because the mistake I made was impossible for a first time user to know, and it was extremely costly to do so. \n",

      "June 2,2017 - I rented the bike for 24 hours for 9.95$/day. I made 4 short trips the same day. Each time, I made sure that bike was docked within stipulated 30 mins. Divvy charged 90$ fees on my card. When I called customer care to inquire, firstly the lady was not courteous, she said I rented the bike for over 4 hours 42 mins. When I mentioned that i did not look the bike out for too long, she said that I did not dock the bike properly in my second trip. She kept on insisting that it was my fault and would not listen to me . She asked me the color code that machine displayed, as if I will remember every second of the journey. After 20-30 mins of hold time, the supervisor offered me to take 50% refund, which I refused to.I will not ride the bike again & will not recommend it. Divvy is making money with dishonest ways. Their docking stations are old fashioned & they are perhaps not upgrading, so they can deceive daily riders. The supervisor mentioned there are no cameras on the stations and they trust their docking stations, which is hard to believe after the incident.I hope such complaints make it city of chicago & they look into the matter.\n",

      "I love to bike in cities and Chicago is a fabulous place because they have 18 miles of uninterrupted bike trails along the lake. However Divvy Bikes require you to check in every 30 minutes and when you get south of Soldier Field the bike stations are not along the lake front so you either have to cross streets or go well off the trail to dock your bike. If you choose not to dock (which we did) then you have to pay a surcharge which runs up your bill. You probably are better off renting from the bike rental place in Millennium Park and paying the day charge so you don't have to fool with the bike docking stations. If the check in was every hour it would be much better. Bikes were in decent condition and loved the ride.\n",

So, I had to go back and find the bike and re-dock it correctly, except it wasn't there! So I called Divvy and told them that the bike was gone, at which point they told me to call every hour and see if the bike was re-docked anywhere else. 30 hours later, after calling dozens of time, filing a police report for a missing bike, and getting told I was going to have to pay $1200 to replace the bike it was finally re-docked.

      "My fiance and I used two bikes to ride along the Lake Michigan riverwalk from the Shedd Aquarium to the oak street beach. The bikes were in good condition and comfortable to ride. The process to rent the bikes out and then dock them when finished is easy. I have two issues keeping me from giving 5 out of 5. I dislike that the only option/\"plan\" is to pay $10 per bike for a 24 hour pass. The other issue is that you have to dock your bike every 30 minutes or else you get charged an additional amount, which depends on how much longer you had between docking beyond 30 minutes. Our ride took 40 minutes and so we were charged an extra $2 per bike for going 10 minutes over. The real kicker is that we were unable to use the bike service in the next 24 hours because we had pre planned most of our trip. All in all, I paid $24 to rent two bikes for 40 minutes. It's not gonna break my bank but it's frustrating that there is no other option for rent duration. We still loved the service though!\n",

      "We've used city bike programs in the past but for the first time, there are enough stations to truly make this replace other public transport, a car or even uber- all of which is actually much slower let alone more expensive. Locals probably get year memberships but visitors can get one day passes $9.95 which gives you unlimited 30' or less rides. Rides over 30' costs extra, but Chicago center is a small (relatively) manageable city for a visitor most stations are less then 4 mi apart. The stations near big attractions like Millennium Park may be low on bikes but just wait and people start dropping them off. You have to use the same credit card at each station to identify yourself and get a new code. Bike codes unlock the bike. The few downsides: no helmet rental so BYOH and the kiosks don't respond well to touch as they should. The bikes are heavy and durable and are the step in kind - unisex. They fit most any height - I'm less than 5' and the hubs 6'. We used them to go from Lincoln Park, to 3 locations downtown, to Old Town and to different areas of lincoln Park. All easy. Good roads. Night lights in the front res blinkers in the back. Importantly - download CHI Bike app and it will always tell you the closest station as well as a map of all stations. Pretty convenient. \n",

      "Bike stations are never too far away and the 30 minute limit is long enough in Chicago to do almost all of the hops that we wanted to do. All of the bikes we rented save one was in excellent working order and there was no problem to swap out for another in that case.Only feedback we would have is that there was no longer term deal - the 24 hour option we used 4 days in a row and it felt like we should have got some kind of a deal on that. More seriously the credit card system was not working properly and after getting three messages saying the system had timed out, later found that I had been charged each time so will of course be requesting this is reimbursed.\n",

You can rent as many bikes from DIFFERENT docks for the 24 hour rate in 30 minute increments. That rule is supposedly displayed in fine print on the screen. Should that be written in BOLD on the bike and the kiosk? It cost me $109 to rent a bike for 8 hours. I should have purchased a bike and given it away when I was finished. Does Trump own DIVVY?\n",

      "Beautiful September day to bike the city. Quite the adventure weaving through crowds of people on a Sunday afternoon, meandering through cars and taxi drivers and walking our bikes across Navy pier. Those experiences are fun memories. However, what puts a bad taste in my mouth is the charge to my credit card: $39 instead of the $9.95 for the day, or two total hour ride. The fine print instructs you to \"return\" your bike every thirty minutes to a docking station to keep the price at $9.95 for the day. If we did this our memorable experience would have been a nightmare instead. I would've rented bikes from Bobby's Bike Hike for the same price and gotten a better bike if I read the fine print. Just keep this in mind when you plan your trip.\n",

Stopped at the next station and returned my bike to get a new one....except after I returned it the comp didn't work. Called customer service and they told me to walk to the next station....while my time using it is ticking away. I asked for a discount due to he multiple calls made to customer service, inconvenience of their system and bike(s) not working, and reduced time actually being able to use the bike and was refused.I love the concepts of bikes in the big city and have done this in Denver and Boston previously. However, I would never use this company again.\n",

      "Rented a couple of Divvy bikes to explore around the Lake front in Chicago while visiting our son who lives in Streeterville. I love this concept of 24 hour membership and free rental. The stations' spacing makes it easy to get to destination without having to go over the 30 minute free rental. For longer destination, its easy to stop at station and quickly check same bike out for continued ride and another 30 minutes free. Did this in DC recently and had a similar good time. The bikes are heavy though and have limited top end gearing so that 15 mph is about as fast as you'll cruise, even if you're a strong biker. The three speed shifters have all worked well and allow for easy slow speed take offs and climbs. Easy quick-release post allows for quick seat adjustment (remember, about a 90% leg extension is about what you should be aiming for to allow the best efficiency.) The tire pressure has been good on all the bikes I've tested and subsequently chosen fir each trip.No helmets is the one down side to the system. I hope this concept is taken to every major metropolitan city in the world. We have a good one in my hometown, Denver but i haven't tried it here cuz this is where my bikes live with me.\n",

      "I've been a key-carrying member since the bike share service began in Chicago. I have used Divvy bikes for basic downtown commuting. I feel like a grannie sitting on the ample seat but they're certainly solid machines. The 2 biggest complaints I have are with the \"basket,\" a metal brace with bungee straps. And, I've ridden too many bikes with gear slip problems.But these shortcomings aren't enough to dissuade me from using the service anytime I'm in the city. There are nifty apps that give you the number of open bike stalls and the number of available bikes...very important when it's a high demand part of the day.I just re-upped my subscription and I'm glad TripAdvisor is allowing me to share my thoughts.Unless you're a passing-through traveler...buying an annual subscription for unlimited use is the best way to go.

      "I enjoyed using the Diivy Bike so much. Using it to ride along the Lakeshore Drive trail was absolutely one of my favorite parts of my trip to Chicago!!Using the recommended Transit app in conjunction with the bike rental was vital to me. It was very intuitive, fast, and easy to use and I was so happy it was available. I found it to be accurate in terms of alerting me to the number of Bikes and return docks available at each station around Chicago, which was a blessing in terms of helping me determine which dock was nearest with the most Bikes (for me to start my ride) and how far I should ride to if I needed an extended trip (based on where Bikes were most available to restart my 30 minutes). I would not have been able to utilize the Diivy with as much success and satisfaction as I could have without the Transit app. Getting a new code was so fast that I didnt even have to unload my stuff from a bike I was returning in order to take it right out again. It was so great. I would avoid trying to get a bike from the downtown area/loop area around rush hour/ sundown. It's difficult.\n",

      "I was REALLY excited to rent bikes to ride along the lakeshore with my family. I was willing to go through the hassle of finding a docking station every half hour to ensure we weren't charged penalty fees. However, at our first stop, about 20 minutes into ride, we were unable to retrieve all of our bikes. We had rented 6 bikes and 2 of them would never unlock with the code given. We tried other bikes. There was another group at this station with the same problem. I even tried to purchase additional ride passes but that didn't work either. So, the 4 on bikes rode back to where we started and 2 walked back. I would recommend just renting a bike for a period of time from a business and knowing you'll have it. It may cost a little more, but it's guaranteed to not be a hassle.\n",

      "Waste of money, waste of time. 1. You must insert credit card at a docking site every 30 minutes to avoid fine print fees. 2. As tourists who don't know the city, good luck finding docking station (the app is useless if you're a tourist) 3. Any Roads with bike lanes were used by cars (very few roads actually had bike lanes-i.e. You have to walk your bike on the sidewalk) 4. Sidewalks too crowded for bikes.5. Dock your bike and slide your credit card for a new bike code and then watch someone walk off with your bike. Now you get to hike all the way to the next docking station. OR have someone stay with your docked bikes as one of you gets a new code. 6. Sketchy detour to get to waterfront path near Navy Pier.7. Spent 98% of the time walking the bike. 8. When you find another station for get a new bike, STAY WITH YOUR BIKE to get a new code. People will steal your bike. The bike must be docked in order to get a new code. 9.What a waste. Walk where you are going. Much faster! You spend your entire 30 minutes searching for a kiosk to avoid fees and keep the $9.95 price. Zero time to leisurely enjoy the waterfront. (Beware: waterfront kiosks will most likely be empty, so guard your bike when you dock for new code or it WILL be taken)  Tips if you still want to do it:TEST BRAKES FIRSTSet watch with a timer of 25 min to avoid fees Ask for printed receipt (your code disappears off the screen VERY quickly) Best tip: Don't do it. \n",

It was brilliant as long as the Divvy Bike rental place you wanted to return your bike to wasn't full (then you'd have to find another spot).

What you don't realize is that lower on the kiosk it says that if you don't dock the bike EVERY 30 mins, fees will apply. We rented 2 bikes for 4 hours & I got a $127 charge on my card! When you call CS, they tell you the bikes are made for short commuter trips that take no more than 30 mins. And if you want it for 24 hrs, you have to dock it every 30 mins. Divvy, let me ask you, who would rent a bike for TWENTY FOUR hours if they had to constantly dock it?? It doesn't even make sense. If you have to dock it every 30 mins, then only rent it out for THIRTY MINUTES. As a tourist, you don't know the city, we got lost several times & finally when we saw a docking station, we gave up after 4 hours. Not as easy to bike around a city you don't know as it seems. But we didn't mind since it was only $9.95. WRONG. I called CS and asked for a manager, I spoke with a manager who was very polite & eventually refunded me 50%, which means I got charged $54 for something I thought would cost me $20. I said to him, \"You can't tell me that you don't get this call once or more everyday from other tourists.\" And he pretty much agreed it is a huge problem. He's even suggested to Divvy to change their kiosks. Divvy, this is criminal behavior. You need to make your fees MUCH CLEARER. Maybe don't make $9.95 for 24 hrs so bold. You are taking advantage of people who come to rent a bike for a day & get financially taken for a ride as well. Make it clear, Divvy is for LOCALS who want a quick ride. This is not tourist friendly.\n",

      "Worst. Customer. Service. Ever.\n",
      "I ride the bike share all the time in DC and love it. Concept is great. Same concept is great in Chicago too. The big difference is, as a tourist in Chicago, you have to purchase a daily pass. The process is a bit tedious, sliding your credit card in and out at the kiosk each time. Often times you have to do it more than once because the reader cannot process your card. I found several kiosks out of service so you couldn't check out another bike.Then the doozy hit. I docked a bike and walked around a bit in Grant park and grabbed some breakfast early one morning. Went to check out another bike and the kiosk said my bike was still out. Worst. Customer. Service. Ever. Was basically told to go back and find my bike and re-dock it because it wasn't properly docked. Was advised by the Divvy Customer Service rep that she does not work for Divvy so she can't address my account or other issues. Was given the bike number and told to look under the seat.Walked 1/1 mile back to dock. Looked at about 8 bikes until I found the one I docked. It was locked in like a baby. Called customer service again. Same representative. Acted like we had never spoken although it was only 10 minutes prior. How many people had she spoken to on a Tuesday morning at 10am? Rrefreshed her memory and she said 'oh yeah'. Told her bike was docked and gave her the name of the dock. Explained it 3 times, spelled the street. (Where are they located????). She said it looks like dock is offline. When it comes online I will note the bike as docked. So, now what? How do I get a bike? Will I get credit for the time you think my bike is out.... so many unanswerable questions by the woman who doesn't work for Divvy.Suffice it to say, I ended up walking 2 miles back to my hotel because the rep gave me a code that didn't work and I just couldn't handle calling back and talking to her again.God bless and good luck if you rent a Divvy bike and something happens. Waiting for some massive charge to hit my credit card and maybe I'll be lucky enough to talk to the same disinterested, condescending \"I don't work for Divvy\" customer service rep.Oh, an I wrote an email to Divvy customer service, the email address on their website. Wait for it... No response.It would be a 1, except the concept is a good idea. I pity the fool with an offline dock.\n",

      "As a tourist this was a great way to do the Lakefront Trail and to see the city. Chicago seems to be one of the few cities that has bike lanes where you can actually fit and not have the fear of being ran over. Only problem is that sometimes it could be difficult to find a place to drop off your bike within 30 minutes (if doing the all day pass) due to sometimes the bike rack being full. Also, it would be nice after downloading the app you could get reminders to drop off your bike, or even have a place for your phone so you can follow the gps to your destination. Overall, we had a great experience.\n",

      "Overall Great, Some Annoyances\n",
      "While Divvy bikes are a great concept for those who live in Chicago, for those of us traveling through/visiting, there were some annoyances that I tried to look past. I downloaded the app to my phone, bought the $9.95 day pass, but was told halfway through the day that I hadn't purchased said pass. So then I had to re-purchase a pass using the same exact credit card and ultimately had to dispute the second charge to the CC company.Since Divvy bikes are for \"short trips\", you have to dock the bike every 30 mins to avoid being charged. We tried setting an alarm for every 25 mins so we could find a Divvy station to re-dock the bike and go through the whole process all over again of retrieving an unlock code, or you risk being charged for going over. There is, of course, an option to add on more time by paying more when purchasing your day-pass. Since I was trying to save on cash, this is why we chose to dock (or at least try to dock) every thirty minutes. Half-way though the day, we just gave up and said screw it, and just kept the bikes for however long we needed it. It was better to enjoy our time that way instead of worrying we couldn't find the next station.Most of the bikes were rideable, some had obvious signs of wear-and-tear, some we couldn't take out because they were reported as \"damaged\" (and therefore you cannot unlock said bike). I would have liked to see a basket on the front and someplace to keep my water bottle secure. There is a little bungee cord on the front so you can place something there, but it won't fit anything as large as a backpack.Yes, I would use these again. Yes, I would purchase more time when I buy the day pass. Ultimately, you get a good view of the city by bike, a good workout, and it's better than Chicago having no bikes at all!\n",

I couldn't imagine trying to use the bikes for more than a day unless your butt gets used to it. On the other hand, it was such a nice way to get around and make quick trips. You also get to explore more of the city this way. Very easy to access with the app (transit). \n",

      "Best way to explore the city\n",
      "If you're physically able, a $10 daily Divvy bike is an awesome way to explore the city. The downside is you can only keep them for 30 minutes at a time, but it wasn't as daunting after our first 30 minute segment spent riding up the lakeside path. Download the Transit App (as of this version, it's green and like a sideways S) which tracks EVERY version of public transportation but is great for the Divvy. Not only does it show all of the numerous bike stations, but it keeps track of how many bikes are available. So, you grab your day permit, it gives you a simple code, unshackle a bright blue Divvy, and off you go exploring. There are plenty of bike stations in the downtown area, no more than 5 blocks apart I'd guess. And bike lanes everywhere. And downtown is not very hilly at all. The best thing is you can turn in a Divvy at one end of a neighborhood, stroll a few blocks enjoying the city, then you use the same credit card as your membership to get a new code and a new bike. One word to the wise - downtown is full of cars, taxis, users, city buses, tour buses, and especially pedestrians. If you're not a confident bike rider, use caution on the busiest roads, like Michigan Ave! \n",

Since we kept the same bikes for hours we accrued penalties. I asked to see if they could waive some of the fees to no avail.

      "Hello. I recently took a Divvy ride down the Lake Shore trail in Chicago. This is a ride that takes a couple hours to do, depending on your speed and your distance. In any case, Divvy charges by the half hour. When going to pay the $10 for the 24 hour pass, the machines explicitly indicated the price. However, in the fine print section of the screens, they include a clause that indicates that one must dock the bike every 30 minutes, presumably for some sort of \"check in\". I did not see this clause as it was discreetly hidden in the fine print and received a bill for $80 the next day. This is not really acceptable for tourists in that they must pretty much be going station-to-station and checking in every half hour, rather than enjoying the ride and beautiful weather that Chicago boasts in the summertime. Also, it's a bit dangerous having to check every destination point in a city that may not be familiar to tourists. In the end, I was not helped by customer service neither by email nor telephone as the fine print pricing was much more accurate than the deceptive large print pricing that misleads customers as to really knowing how long to expect their rides to be. Don't be surprised if it happens that you get an incredibly expensive bill with conditions that are included in print like a Ponzi scheme.\n",

You don't have to worry about locking them as you simply drop them in a station when you are close to where you want to spend time. I would say that the app is a must. If you do not visit a Divvy station every thirty minutes, the costs will pile on. But the app does a good job reminding you when there is 5 mins left and points you to the next closest station. When you do return to a station to reset the 30 minute clock, simply reinsert the bike into the station and dip the same credit card you used to get the bikes. There machine gives you a new release code and you are good for another 30 minutes. Also, if you get to a station and there are no empty spots, you simply dip your card and it gives you an extra 15 mins. All in all, it was an affordable way to get around the city and if you don't mind having to stop every 30 minutes, it's worth it!!\n",

      "Divvy is a great way to see Chicago. Pick your bike here and leave it there. All that for $9.95 for 24 hours + trip fees. The first 30 minutes are free and the first 60 minutes cost $2. After that you are getting into bigger bucks, e.g. 90 minutes for $6.To stop the clock you need to dock your bike at any station. And you can check out the very same bike that you just checked in.- To check out a bike. Since time is money, get the bike ready first: adjust the seat height, put your items in the front basket... Then enter your code. If you plan to ride with someone, enter your code simultaneously. Once you get a green light, the easiest way to undock a bike is to lift it up by its saddle.- To check it in. First verify the station you want to go to has empty docks via the Divvy app. Once you are at an empty dock, roll the bike in and lift slightly the handlebar until you see the green light on the left side of the dock station. That's CRITICAL. If the bike is not checked in correctly, the clock is still running and you will not be able to check out another bike.- 30 free minutes Vs. $2 for 60 minutesIt may be a better deal to pay $2 and get 60 minutes of riding than try to dock every 30 minutes. 60 minutes give you more range and allow you to get to your real destination. Of course, if you see a Divvy station along the way, dock your bike by all means. To get the most value, map your route first even before checking out any bike. The Divvy app can help you do that.- Practice docking/undocking Since the first 30 minutes are free, hold down your horses and spend 5 minutes to practice docking and undocking at your very first station. Then take off.- Last but not least do not ride on sidewalks. It is against the law, annoys pedestrians and gives Divvy a bad rap.Keep these tips in mind while you are enjoying your rides around town(s). In Summer 2016 Divvy is expanding to Oak Park & Evanston.\n",

      "It's such a rip off and the pricing is not very clearly stated. We thought that we would pay $9.95 for the 24 hour pass plus $8 to not have to keep docking it every 30min. Wow were we wrong! It's 9.95 plus $8 if you have it for up to 90min plus $8 for each additional 30min. My card was charged $63 for couple hours of divvy. DO NOT USE IT!\n",

      "Avoid the Nightmare of Renting a Divvy Bike, can be costly and very frustrating!!!\n",
      "We tried to use a Groupon on 3 bikes and what a nightmare for several reasons: The system to check out bikes is too lengthy even without the Groupon. I could only use 1 credit card for each bike, therefore I used 3 credit cards, then not knowing which is for what bike. The touch screen you have to input all the information is not touch sensitive, so you end up reentering and pushing harder for all the information it is asking you, several screens to go through, while a line is forming behind you. At the end of trying to rent 3 bikes it took us almost the 30 minutes to get the bikes only to have to re dock the bikes at the same station, yet we would have to wait in the line of disgruntled customers after we took so long. 30 minutes for anyone whether a commuter and especially for a tourist which it seems to attract is way too short. Plus we ended up getting charged over $30 on each credit card for keeping the bikes for 2 hours, since we wanted to avoid the nightmare of having to re dock them every 30 minutes due to the confusion of 3 credit cards and a line of people at the stations. Also there are not always even bikes or dock slots open. So, if you are a tourist for the day in Chicago, we recommend avoid the DIVVY bikes due to the fact of long time to go through the screens and it doesn't take all credit cards and the time limit of 30 minutes, you really only have 20 minutes once you get going to find the next nightmare dock. They are not helpful in refunding either. This is not the only poor experience we have had so be warned to stay away from DIVVY until they improve their customer service in many aspects.\n",

      "Handy way to get around\n",
      "We found Divvy a convenient way to get around the Chicago lakefront. The bicycles are standard bikeshare 3-speeds: heavy and slow but functional. We rode them from the Field Museum to the Art Institute, then up the lakefront to the beginning of the Magnificent Mile. Chicago drivers seemed pretty tolerant of bikes but it is a busy city so it helps to be comfortable biking in traffic. You are not supposed to bike on the sidewalk. The lakefront path is a very pleasant ride.The key to bikeshare is to use them for point-to-point travel of less than 30 minutes, not a leisurely bike ride, as the charges increase after 30 min. It's also a very good idea to download the app as it'll tell you where the docking stations are located - and importantly whether there are any available bikes or open spots to dock. The dock closest to the Art Institute was full in the early afternoon on Friday so we had to find the next closest, a couple of blocks away.\n",

      "This was a bad idea\n",
      "My wife and I and another couple were visiting Chicago and decided to take a nice bike ride down the coast. We parked by a station with some open bikes, and were excited to check them out. To our dismay, we learned that you are charged extra for every half hour you have the bikes checked out. So we came up with a plan to stop and switch out bikes every half hour or so since you are not charged extra. This worked at first, but was a huge pain and instead of being able to take a nice ride, we were biking as fast as we could to get to the next station. We stopped after about an hour to go check out the beach and left our bikes at the station. After spending a few minutes there, we decided to head back, this time deciding that we wouldn't stop along the way so that we could enjoy the ride. But this time, the machine wouldn't read either of our credit cards. We called customer service and they just told us to walk to the next station. We were pretty annoyed about this since we only paid for two hours of parking and needed to get back. But we walked to the next station anyway. Once we got there, it read my credit card, but said we still had a bike checked out! We called customer service again, and they told us we had to go BACK to the last station to check on the bike, even though we had all checked our bikes and made sure they were secure. So one of us headed to the car, while the rest of us had to go back to the station. Long story short, our 2 hour leisurely bike ride turned into a one hour bike race down the coast followed by another hour and a half of walking back and forth. The machines didn't work, the customer service basically couldn't do anything about it, and they offered no refunds or compensation. If you're on a timetable or a budget, these are a bad idea.\n",

      "Good System, But Be Prepared & Do Your Homework!\n",
      "This was my wife's & my first time using a public-share bike system and we really enjoyed it. Primarily we used it along the lake shore and not downtown itself (we didn't feel safe riding on the streets with so much traffic). In general the bikes were comfortable, easy to use and in good working condition. With that being said you really need to be prepared and do your homework. Once you pay your $10 +/- you can use the bikes all day but only in 30 minute intervals. True, this can be a challenge (that's how they make their $) so you have to know where you're going and if there is a station(s) along the way. I strongly recommend checking out their website and reviewing their policies, maps & videos before using this system. I also downloaded their mobile app which had an interact map showing all of their bike station locations. I've read some complaints saying that the app showed a station only to find, upon arriving to that location, there was no station there. We never had that problem. However like other reviewers have commented, we have rode our bikes to stations only to find that there were no bikes available to use (for example - aquarium, planetarium, museums, pier, etc. / typically in the afternoon & evening when everyone is looking for a way \"home\" from the touristy spots). It was no problem for us since we didn't put ourselves in that situation of relying on a bike to get home from the popular destinations. Since we already had bikes we simply checked our bike back in at the next station, got a new 30-minute use code and rode our bikes to the next station along our route. Once you get the system down it's a lot of fun and a great way to see the Chicago sites!\n",

Docking a bike every 30 minutes can be a bit annoying but even without pre-planning I managed to find a new docking station within 30 minutes. I browsed through different areas of the city with my iPad and the iPhone app when connected to a wifi network and the app showed the docking stations even when offline. The Android app didn't.\n",

We weren't familiar with the area and spent 30-40 minutes trying to get an open dock. Little did we know that right in front of the field (Field Museum) they had employees taking all extra bikes to free up docks for return. I wish that notice came up when selecting that a nearby dock was full and you were re-routed.\n",

      "Excellent Concept, Below Average Implementation\n",
      "The title of the review sums this service up pretty well. Exciting opportunity to have access to bikes in locations throughout Chicago. Reasonable cost to rent, apps make finding stations easy and finding safe bike lanes simple. The apps do tell you where bikes are and how many are at the station, but at rush times the bikes can be cleared out (if you are looking for one) or stations filled (if you'd like to return one) for the location you want and all the surrounding ones. During special events they have staff at locations like the lakefront or train stations, but those are rare. I just am not sure if a city of Chicago run entity or any entity for that matter can fully implement this concept effectively. The amount of staff it might require to truly pay attention to all the stations might be cost prohibitive. In the end, I use it as it is \"fun\" and beats walking, just be prepared to be frustrated 30-40% of the time if you can find a bike or get rid of one when and where you want to.\n",

      "We decided to use the Divvy bikes instead of renting one as A.) It's so much cheaper and B.) We didn't want the bike for that long.The 24 hour pass is $9.95 but you must check your bike in at a check point every 30 minutes to avoid an additional charge (however the charge isn't too bad and still works out cheaper than renting a bike if you happen to go over the time limit.) The first day we used a Divvy bike our closest point was empty, so we walked about 4 blocks to the next point where there were very few bikes left. We jumped on and rode along the lake to Lincoln Park which was lovely. Due to the very hot, humid weather we couldn't bare riding back so hopped on a bus and decided we'd do an evening bike ride later on.In the evening we walked to 3 Divvy bike stops and all were empty, making the $9.95 seem a bit pointless for a 30 minute ride out of 24 hours. Thankfully at the weekend they were offering free 24 hours passes, we located a Divvy Stand but the 2 bikes remaining were broken, so walked to another 3 stops and on the 4th stop finally got a bike! Overall, if you can get a bike and only want it to get to A - B then this is a great way of getting about. It's so much cheaper than renting a bike, however the having to check it in every 30 minutes really takes the fun out as you have to keep clock watching. We did really enjoy riding the bikes and there are plenty of Divvy stands around to check the bike in, but well located stands tend to have no bikes resulting in a long walk to actually get one. I'd definitely use it for a lake front ride but anything more can be a bit of a drag and make sure you do your research to locate a Divvy stand to check your bike into after the 30 minutes!!!I think 30 minutes is too little, even if it got upped to a 45 minute ride it would help a lot more!\n",

      "Seven of us visited Chicago. We stayed downtown and planned to bike to the Lincoln Zoo along the lake. Divvy bikes was recommended by the hotel. It took us a few phone calls and several tries to unlock the bikes. After 20 minutes we finally left the station. Being from out of the country we had never used this system and selected the $9.95 day pass - someone in our group said it may be an additional $2 for the second hour. To my dismay, I was charged $107.78 (Cdn) on my VISA for 2 bikes for just over 2 hours. My sister had the same charge and my other sister was only charged $9.95. Customer service was not friendly and said the charges are clearly listed on the website - which I only saw a week after the fact, however it is very complicated to figure out. In addition, the site mentioned that you had to take the bike to a docking station every 30 minutes - but it took us very long to check the bikes out in the first place and we did not notice any stations while riding north along the lake. There should be a limit on the amount charged and a warning to tourists not to rent Divvy bikes. The only cost that was CLEARLY advertised was the $9.95/day pass. I assume the city must make a lot of money from people unfamiliar with this service.\n",

For $9.95 per 24 hours, you can zip all around. One limitation is the 30 minute limit per bike trip or you get dinged with extra charges. You need to trade in the bike at the next divvy stand before the 30 minutes is up and check out another bike (all on the original fee). Lots of stations in key sightseeing spots so not to worry. We stayed at a large hotel on Michigan Ave and found that the 30 minutes was fine for a ride to the Museum or Millennium Park or around the beaches.

      "Divvy is Chicago's bike sharing system, if you are familiar with other cities systems, this should be easy for you. Check their website and other reviews here for more info. Basic common sense and some planning can help. Bring a helmet, find a bike that fits your height before unlocking it, then you don't have to adjust it, however it's fairly easy to raise or lower most seats. Test that first before unlocking. There are no drink holders, but a thick bungee cord for holding a bag in front. Make sure the your valuables are very secure, as I had a bag slip thru while biking. Always make sure you have a destination station in mind, and a plan B if it's full. You can check online to see what's open, but it can be unpredictable. I always make sure to have several spots open at destination station before I depart. We've encountered a problem returning a bike once, due to faulty mechanism. Things happen, so if you have a plan B, you don't have to worry about it. In general the bikes are comfortable and sturdy if a bit heavy. They have gears and are easy to ride. Obey safe biking laws, and try to use the bike lanes. Make sure to time your trip, to accommodate 30 min. limit. There are plenty of stations so you can bike and stop to explore the city with ease and convenience. Join Divvy for small yearly fee or take advantage of a day pass.

      "I called customer support after finding out I was supposed to dock every 30 minutes. I wanted to see what they charged and if it could be waived. I purchased the 24 hour pass and had the bike for 4 hours and the overage fees somehow were $62. This does not seem fair or reasonable. Customer service would not do anything, so I asked to speak to speak to a supervisor. She thought the fee was within reason, but agreed to reduce it to half. She said that the only way to get it fully waived is to email support. The overage fee and charges are very misleading. Had I known it was this much I would have rented a bike for $23.\n",

      "We rented this for the last couple days that we were in Chicago. I wish that we had tried it sooner. The premise is fairly self-explanatory. There are numerous spots around the city to rent these bicycles. Most are no more than a 15 minute ride apart from each other. Many are much less. For less than $10 for a 24 hour period, you can use these an unlimited amount of times. The only caveat is that you must check in at a station every 30 minutes and request a new code if you want to ride longer. We use this time limit to plan our day. We used the wonderful app on our phones to find where we wanted to go and where the closest station was at. The only time that we ever ran into an issue, was when the stations were completely full. In this case, you request a 15 minute extension for no charge and ride to the next station. We were able to get through town with ease, and saved numerous taxi trips. The bikes are well-maintained, and comfortable. This was a great way to ride along the lake and enjoy the weather.\n",

We went to go to Navy Pier and the station was full but a representative from Divvy was there to check the bikes in anyway. We trusted her putting in the information and taking the bikes. A few days later we check the bank account and they charged us for full day use, even though we only took the bikes from the station were we stayed to Navy Pier, which is about 15mins. We called to get our money back because the bill was over $100. They said it is our problem because we can't proof that we actually dropped of the bikes at that time. In the end we got some of it refunded but not all. We guess the lady forgot to press a button or whatever. We recommend to always put them in the station and make sure it locked.

      "You must be 16 to rent a bike and you can only rent 2 bikes per credit card, so you need to plan ahead if you come with a family. We brought just our 8 year old's bike, planing to rent for the rest of us so we didn't have so many bikes on the car for our cross country trip. We also brought our own helmets. The other thing to know is that it is $9.95 for a 24 hour pass, but if any trip is longer than 30 min, you get charged more so you need to plan to take several short trips. We loved going on the lakefront path, but it was tricky to find. There is a cyclefinder app to help find the bikes and also a timer to help avoid the exra charges, and Google maps has a way to turn on bike paths, to help plot the best routes. We went from the south side to the Art Institute, Navy Pier, Lincoln Park, and Chinatown all on bikes. Great way to cover a lot of ground without parking and also getting some exercise!\n",

      "Great concept that we were excited to find since my wife was pregnant and not wanting to walk excessively. This allowed us to take in a whole lot more of the Lake front/downtown area with a nice leisurely bike ride. However there was a trail of frustrations that hopefully can be ironed out for future riders.1) The station we had planned to use first had no bikes...Adler Planetarium - probably because not a big dropoff spot but a frustration none-the-less. We walked to Shedd.2) I checked in at the Shedd station before going in so that the process would be quicker after and rented 2 bikes. After our visit at the museum The Shedd station credit card reader wasn't working. Several people were around trying to get bikes and some were phoning but the only suggestion was to go to the Field Museum station (approx 10 minute walk). We had already paid for the day rental so we went there to see.3) The Field museum station was fully stocked with bikes however the people around the station indicated that this station wasn't reading credit cards either. Someone phoned and it was suggested that we walk to Michigan avenue another 10-15 minute walk. Would have been nice if the operator wouldn't send us to a faulty station. They must have known because someone told us it was down all day.4) Michigan station - we finally got a bike and got to ride down Michigan. Stations were well spaced here and we had no problems docking and checking in. 5) We walked through Taste of Chicago to another station but they only had 1 bike. My wide rode the bike and I jogged to Navy Pier. We got another bike.6) We rode along the lake to 360 Chicago and then headed back to Adler. When we checked in at another station it took our bikes but wouldn't read our cards. We walked 10 minutes to another station and it had no bikes. We walked to another station on Michigan and finally found bikes. The bikes took us a long ways but failed at getting us back. So much for my wife not walking much. If you use this system be prepared for unreliable stations and unpredictable availability.\n",

We struggled and we watched many many grown functional intelligent adults not to able to sign up for a new bike try or get a bike that's already been used. It is such a poor system from start to finish and the bikes don't work that well . When you do final fine one that works well it's great ride around the city but man it's such a painful.concept.

      "Divvy is a great way to get around, especially during the two weeks we have good weather here in Chicago. In case you can't take five minutes to read the details of your rental, here you go:1. It's $7 for 24 hours, in 30 minute increments, meaning you have to re-dock your bike every half hour or incur charges. People think this is a rip-off, but this is a bike SHARING system. If you could take the one bike for 24 hours, no bikes would be available. 2. Each station has a map showing where the other stations are. Most stations downtown are within a 2 minute bike ride, maybe a bit more in the neighborhoods. In any case, you shouldn't have a problem finding a station within 30 minutes, unless you're trying really hard not to find one. There's a Divvy app you can download that shows you where the stations are, and how empty/full they are. 3. Check your bike for flats first, and adjust the seat!4. Finally, you can save a ton by not paying for parking at the most popular attractions in the city.\n",

      "So start with the positives - this is a great idea and a great way for tourists to tour/get around the waterfront area in Chicago (which is beautiful btw). However, that said, it does not work well on a busy beautiful Saturday/Sunday afternoon when everybody wants to ride a bike! So here is our experience -We easily picked up 4 bikes at a downtown location near South Michigan Avenue. The 30 minute check in time flew by and we went to check in our bikes at a location on the waterfront. It appears that location's machine was not working well - there was a guy there trying to fix it - the racks were full of bikes and there were dozens of people standing around wanting a bike but it appeared nobody could get one! Our precious 30 minute time slot was quickly running out and finally at the last minute a few spaces opened up and we were able to quickly put our bikes on the rack so we didn't get charged the extra money. But then the lineup for the machine to re-check out another bike was a mile long! So we decided we would walk to the next location (how far could it be right?) When we got there, there was 1 lonely bike in the rack but no line up at the machine! So now there were people coming back with their rentals, racking them up and then checking them back out immediately (which is what we would have done at the last location except we couldn't get near the machine!) So again we walked to the next location - right at Navy Pier - it was a zoo with lots of bikes and lots of people - so this time we stood in line and waited to get our ticket to recheck out our bikes. We finally got our new codes and went to check out our bikes - 3 out of the 4 codes worked so 3 of us had our bikes - the 4th code would not work so 3 of us are standing there wasting minutes of our precious 30 minute time period waiting for the 4th person to get the attention of an attendant who happened to be there and get his bike out! We used up that 30 minutes, racked the bikes up for the last time and swore we would not do that again!So how could this be better? First of all - they need a much better system for rechecking out the bikes every 30 minutes. You should not have to rack your bike and then get in line to get a new ticket. And 30 minutes is really no time at all on a bike - could the rechecking period not be made at least 60 minutes? So - try it if you want - but beware those nice sunny days especially on the weekend!\n",

The system of getting tickets with new codes for getting bikes is inefficient and fills your pocket with garbage4. Do locals even use these? I am not convinced. You guys need to put more stations along the Lakefront Trail. This is where everyone wants to bike. Do you want confused tourists getting honked at in Chicago traffic...NOPE. 5. The on street bike infrastructure does not match the number of stations.

Most of the places that we wanted to visit were within 30 minutes of each other. These are bulky, three-speed cruiser bikes, not meant for exercise riding..For exercise or distance riding there are regular bike rentals available along the water front.Suggest downloading the Divvy bike app before you go as it will help you find the next bike station. There are penalties for not returning the bike every 30 minutes so you need to keep track of time and location of bike stations. If you want to use a bike all day, it is more convenient to rent a regular bike. A regular bike will also get you a helmet, something that does not come with Divvys.\n",

The system works although sometimes you have to wait and try several times to get the bikes, but in general the rides are in ok shape and work properly. Good system. \n",

It's a great way to get around the city-just be sure to turn them in every 30 minutes. The lake path around Navy Pier was under construction.\n",

      "This is a fantastic way to get around. There are plenty of stations throughout the city, so you can easily get your bike checked back in within 30 minutes. Many of the streets have bike lanes, so it was just fine riding around. In some of the more popular areas (for example, around Lakeshore Dr.), sometimes the stations can be filled up or have nonworking stalls, which can be a bit of a pain. However, most are fine and the bikes are in fairly good condition. This allows you to cover WAY more ground than walking, and you can get to all the attractions without the hassle of parking or dealing with cab fare/public transit. Highly recommend this!\n",

We finally got the answer. 'You don't have a US credit card!' If we only would have known that these services are only for those who posess a US credit card.

      "We tried these out one day on a visit to Chicago and used the bikes for a ride along the lake side bike trail that runs along the shore of Lake Michigan We rode from the Edgewater area, south to the Oak Street Beach downtown docking our bikes about 3 times to make the trip since we stopped to do a little site seeing along the way. You can rent the bikes for 7.00 a day, the down side being that you have to park them at a docking station every half hour or incur additional fees. The stations are all over the place and as long as you time your ride , you really can do it for just the 7.00 for the day. I would suggest printing off a map of the docking stations before you ride. The bikes are simple 3 speed bikes designed mostly for sightseeing and commuters and are built like tanks. Too big for kids and they do take a little while to get used too. The ride along the lake is beautiful however.\n",

      "We were excited to rent these bikes to ride along the Lake Michigan Waterfront. At $7 for 24 hour hours this is quite a bargain!. The downside is the technology and the requirement to return the bike to a kiosk and \"re-rent\" every half hour. We kept the bikes for two hours and loved our ride along the lake-- near Oak Street Beach and North. However, we had problems returning the bikes and getting a \"green light\" to show we had. In two hours, we had to call divvy bikes for help twice. A helpful hint is to download an app about biking chicago. This app will show you where nearby Divvy stations are located, how far away they are, how many bikes are available at a particular station and will also let you set an alarm to let you know how much time you have before you need to return the bikes to a kiosk. A great way to see the sights and get some exercise. Remember--helmets do not come with these bikes. \n",

I expect this is because of the chip and PIN functionality that most cards (outside the US) now have. I tried it with a swipe-only pre-paid card I had from Aus, that was accepted by the 'dip' machine, but the transaction still failed, likely because I couldn't put in a US postcode.Would have been fun, shame it wasn't designed with travellers in mind!I called their help desk, they confirmed it wasn't a fault with the station, they said 'yes overseas cards work' but they didn't realise that most overseas cards now have chip and PIN. If you have an old swipe-only card maybe it would work.Very disappointing!Also strange how it said $7 on the sign, but when you start with the machine transaction it straight away becomes $14.\n",

      "I approached my Chicago biking experience with a plan - bike as far as I could along the lakefront without over doing it. I rented a bike a few blocks West of the lake and biked in the bike lane on Illinois avenue until the lane ended and I had to become one with the traffic - a tad daunting for a tourist, but I managed. It also took me awhile to locate the lake front bike path from Navy Pier, but once found, I had a great ride to Lincoln Park and back in just over an hour. I have no idea what the charge for this might have been, but it was worth it. A beautiful day and a beautiful fellow tourist to help me re-dock the bike at the end of the ride. I overshot the curb cut at one point by a few feet due to pedestrian traffic and my idea to lift the bike over a curb was met with a surprise - these bikes weigh a ton! Lifting it even six inches was a mighty feat. Also, some of the \"flipping\" around I do on my bike at home to change directions from a resting point is not going to happen with these heavy 3-speed jobs. Not sure I would trust the availability, reliability and/or speed of these bikes to deliver me from Spot A to Spot B, but a loose, casual goal for one was a beautiful way to spend an hour with the rest of humanity on a lakeside Saturday and I am grateful these bikes were available for that purpose. It would have taken me 3 hours to walk the same distance/see those same sights, so that is a deal almost any way you slice it.\n",

Station had broken bike returns , the bikes simply wouldn't lock when trying to return , so I had to find another station to return then walk back 6 blocks. On the bright side I was able to explore the city and ride down lake shore all for 7 bucks.  \n",

      "What confusion! Thank goodness there's someone who works for the company at each kiosk we went to, because it was confusing to sign up the first time, it was really confusing to figure out where the next kiosk was located (we did the app, but the map didn't say, for instance, that you had to go under a bridge and over to get to the kiosk...it just showed a dot on a map. 30 minutes is WAY too short a time period to get to the next kiosk!! Plus, do out-of-towners a favor and put some markings on the pavement or put up signs leading to your kiosks! Other people on Divvy bikes were asking US where to find the next stop, and we were no help.Also, we are tall, and the bike was uncomfortable for my 6'4\" husband. You can raise the seat, but not the handlebars, so his neck hurt after about 40 minutes. As other reviews have mentioned, it would be easier to just rent a bike for how ever many hours you wanted and ride up and down the lakeshore. That part was awesome...can't wait to do it again.

Maybe a 1 hour window would be smarter. So many miles of trails and the views along Lake Michigan made the ride a great experience. If we were to do this again we would probably look to rent bikes for the day or a set time and not worry about the every 30 minute restart. Overall a good idea but needs to be better executed.\n",

      "This is a cool idea for getting around the downtown area and other areas close by. We rode around a lot over 6 days for relatively cheap. The idea is that you can rent a bike for 24 hours for $14. You pay the one time fee with a credit card and it gives you a code to enter on the bike dock. This unlocks the bike and off you go. The pros - cheap, many locations all over, an app that is supposedly great for locating bike stations (we were having personal app issues). Cons - you have to \"return\" your bike every 30 mins in order to avoid overage charges (you can do this as many times as you want within your 24 hour rental period), you then \"re-rent\" your bike and get a new code to unlock the bike (you must insert your original credit card so that they know you are the right person). You have to find a docking station where you are before the end of your 30 minutes - there are a lot but not always right in front of you when you need them and having to look at the website on your phone is not necessarily convenient, not all the docking spots work - sometimes you get a new code to rent the bike and it won't unlock (you have to make sure beforehand that the light on the dock is yellow). Sometimes it won't even let you return the bike because the docking space is not working. Then you have to either find another location and/or call the number listed on the machine. Sometimes the credit card reader is not working so you have to find another location - this happened several times for us and it was very frustrating. We called the number listed and they apologized and said they were having issues and added more time on our account for the trouble. All in al, I liked this idea and if everything had been working we would have rated it an excellent. Since there were issues I gave it only a Very Good. \n",

      "The Chicago Divvy bike system is a fantastic idea--in theory. You buy a 24 hour pass for $7. You get a code from the kiosk, enter the code into the bike rack, then remove your bike--in theory. Then, you can ride for 30 minutes before returning it to a station, where you return it to the rack, dip your credit card into the kiosk for a new code, then remove your new bike from the rack--in theory. Unfortunately, the kiosks are bogged down, the bike racks don't always lock and recognize a return, the lines for the kiosks are long and more often than not, the racks are either all full or empty, so you have to go to another station. We spent an entire day using Divvy and called customer service 5 times to fix code issues or to issue new codes because the bike racks didn't recognize our return.

Something nice is that there is a map of nearby locations at each station, including a circle showing how far a 5-minute walk would be.The bikes are really heavy (probably because of the technology needed for the rental), so it made it a little difficult to ride and make tight turns.

      "Apparently we have been using the DIVVY Bikes (Blue Bikes) all around the downtown Chicago area to get around. There is a convenience and pleasure to having access to these bikes in a lot of locations. There is also a lot of room for improvement for the bike user. During the month of July, we have encountered these problems along with others encountering the same problems. First you get only 30 minutes from point A to point B, to find another DIVVY bike stand. This does not give you enough time to unload your bike, especially if you are new to the DIVVY and have to locate a drop off. 30 minutes about time you are on your bike and headed out you will lose at least 5 mins. If you are with a few people, they too have to check out and if there is a line of people, which we have encountered at various locations, your time is ticking aways. Then when you get to another location and there is a line you have to wait to checkout another bike. The screens you have to go through are numerous and confusing especially to tourists and foreigners, they don't have a zip code or a easy phone number, along with reading all the acceptances you have to accept from 1 screen to another and there have been a few occasions credit cards work at one location and don't at the next, along with have to pay more than $7 if you go over the 30 minute check in, which adds up quickly. We got to the point where we avoided checking in because to check out again and wait in the line of people who don't understand the lengthy checkout process, gets frustrating. Also, after a month of these encounters, we walked to 2 locations in 1 day to find no bikes in the racks to be checked out. Talk about being stranded in a city! Too expensive, not enough time to ride should be 1 hour from point A to B, stock the bikes and make the screen more customer friendly for everyone to use!\n",

      "The way it works... Go to a station, and $7 gives you a \"day pass.\" However note that in order to make sure that people return bikes, and there's always a supply, they limit you to 30 minutes in any one stint before they start adding extra usage fees. You can trade in and out as much you want for the day, as long as each trade is 30 minutes or less. Our observation is that there were always enough bikes, but because the check-out process at the station is a little long, you can end up spending too much time in line waiting for people to get checked out. I think I would just incur the usage fees in the future to avoid the lines (the usage fees start small and then escalate at over an hour). They have an app where you can see the tons of different Divvy stations.We were there on a busy, gorgeous Saturday and rented our first bike at Millenium Park and traveled to Navy Pier and then up the lake shore up to Briar Theater to see Blue Man Group for a total of around 5 miles with one trade in the middle. Note that if it's a weekend, and you think it will be gorgeous to go to the lake shore, so will everyone else. Factor a fun, but pretty slow ride into your calculations. Also make sure you're pretty comfortable riding a bike in general - there are lots of pedestrians and bikers to navigate, and presumably you won't be wearing a helmet. Overall, we had a blast and would definitely recommend this as a way to navigate the city.\n",

I would never take this if I had a set time that I wanted to be somewhere, but it was ok for the weekend, which is what I was using it for. However, the stations almost never worked. Spanish seemed to work more often than us than English. The process of renting needs to be made faster, and they should put more than one machine at the more popular stops. Once they work out the issues, I will use the bikes all the time.\n",

      "Family Vacation with 2 Families\n",
      "Two families with 5 kids ranging from 10 years to 15 years of age. We had a blase riding bikes along Lakeshore Blvd for 2 days. Rode up to Lincoln Park zoo and further north and then down south to the Field Musuem and Shedds Aquarium.Would have like to have rode down to the Science and Engineering museum, but due to events in that area at that time, we were not able.I will list the Pros and Cons below;Pros - can be a low cost. Easy to ride, plenty of bikes and station to pick up and turn in bikes. Can adjust seat heights and riding along Lakeshore Blvd was very scenic and fun. After the 1st day I figures out to ride the bikes for about 30 to 60 minutes and then dock bikes. Checking out bikes was easy if card machine is working. We were able to rent the bikes for about 15 dollars a day if checking in as required. Cons - You can only ride for about 30 minutes or you will inccur overtime charges. Overtime charges are not that bad for 30-60 minutes or even up to 90 minutes, but anytime after that can be expensive. You have to dock you bikes and then you can check them out again. But if you were like us with 8 bikes, you might come up to a station that does not have 8 docking stations ( so then what do you do - you want to turn in your bike but no places to dock so you end up going to another docking station). Next you have to charge the bike on a credit card and only two bike per credit card max. If you were like me with 4 then I had to use two credit cards. At times the machine would not read one of my credit cards so I had to use my friends credit card to obtain the bike. You have to make sure when you dock your bike that you make sure the light turns green or your bike will not be docked and you could inccur high charges. If you keep the bike 24 hours without docking then the cost can be as high as $100 plus. Last day we rode up to the Shedds aquarium and was hoping to ride back once musuem closed, but when we went to the bike station, all the bikes where checked out. Would not recommend riding bikes in the city as a little to dangerous.\n",

      "On a weekend trip to Chicago this summer, we discovered Divvy bikes. The regular cost is $7 for 24 hours (a HUGE bargain!) but was on sale this weekend for $5! We were excited to rent bikes for our group (7 of us) and ride around town. our first experience was a bad one, unfortunately. You can only rent two bikes per credit/debit card, which we think is really dumb and inconvenient. Some of the bikes would not \"unlock\" from the station (it is self-serv), so, in a nutshell, after over an hour, we could not rent the bikes (and had paid some $35 on various credit cards.) Apparently , the problem had been with that particular bike station (there was MANY, MANY many of these staions around town.) We tried to get bikes (under the same rentals) at a different time and station, and all worked fine. Riding around town was a fantastic experience (as are the bike lanes) and we learned so much in doing so. This is an incredible concept and bargain, but you need to work out the kinks!! Allow as many bikes per card as you want AND have a way of knowing whether the bike/station is functioning properly before you insert money and attempt rental. GOOD IDEA!!\n",

Which would have been great but the adler station wasn't working and we had to ride our bikes a 1/2 mile to the field museum and walk back the half of mile. When we tried to use them in the afternoon, the machines were down again and we walked to 5 different stations to find a guy taking the bikes because the station was full. However we could not get any bikes and we left to walk all of millennium park and Michigan ave. The guy from Divvy said that we could call the 800# which I already did. Customer service is in Canada and was no help at all. They said a tech would be out in an hour. Whoever runs the DC bikes has it all figured out. I would not recommend for convenience.\n",

      "Very Disappointed, I rented two bikes from the museum campus and rode them to Navy Pier. Once I made it to that terminal, the station was down and a tech was there to fix the issue. However, I was informed by the workers I can leave the bikes with them and they will text the Supervisor the code on the bikes to let them know we were on time to avoid extra fees. Now my issue is the next day I was charged extra fees so I called customer service and explained my situation. The First rep “Your case will be escalated and someone will contact you within 24 hours. Never got a call back The Second Rep I explained my situation again. I even ask did the previous rep leave notes she stated “NO” and insured me she noted everything plus she will give me a call back the next day if no one has contacted me back. Never got a call back The Third time I call I spoke with a supervisor (which probably was not) I explained myself again, why because there were no notes and this person said he will refund the fees. I emailed customer service got the same response.  “Thank you for contacting us. Your case has been escalated and is currently being reviewed. We need more time to obtain more information about the station involved. We will be contacting you soon about the status of the refund request. Thank you”I called again spoke with another rep I explained the situation once more. At first he could not find my information, and then he said the last time I rode was in 2012 which is very funny because Divvy just had a one year anniversary. Now the first and second rep I spoke with stated they are not authorized to issue refunds, however, the last rep said he issued a refund (I don’t believe that either). Ok so no one leaves notes nor did the Supervisor issue a refund. Basically when a bike station is down no one reports the issue?Divvy Customer Service is horrible…\n",

      "I work in the Loop and commute via Metra. My wife and I took the BNSF Saturday morning express to the Loop, hop on a Divvy around Union Station, and do our relays to lakefront, museum campus, and Cermak Chinatown. CHI Bikes app is helpful in determining what station to go next. We will do six to ten Divvy relays before catching later afternoon BNSF express back to the western 'burb.Divvy can do a better job in providing a more detailed downtown Chicago station map. The one I found on the website only covered North Ave to Museum campus. There is only one station on the Lakeshore Drive side of Grand Park, can use couple more to be tourists friendly.There are a lot more designated bike lanes compared to five years ago, but in some places the bike lane is not in a continuous stretch. In the absence of bike lane such as a crossing a narrow bridge overpass, sometimes we opted to ride on the sidewalk rather than competing with cars and CTA buses. Overall, my wife and I enjoyed Saturday biking around Chicago lakefront. We plan do couple more bike outings in the coming months: far-north route to 4800 north / Lawrence; and far-south route to Hyde Park UC/Museum of S&I.\n",

Boy, was I surprised!The commute from the Loop down to Mc Cormick would have been $5 each way on the electric train, probably $20 for a cab and simply too far to walk (3 miles?). By bike it was an easy 10 minute trip while you rode along the banks of Lake Michigan. It was spectacular and such a great way to get some modest exercise while enjoying the glorious Spring weather.I also used Divvy to try out a great Indian restaurant across town and to later rent a car at Union Station. It was just to convenient and affordable, I just couldn't believe it. If you're tired of staring out of car windows or noisy trains, give these Divvy bikes a try.

      "Divvy is awesome BUT... what you need to know before you rent\n",
      "Before we get a summer full of tourists reviews about how frustrating Divvy is and how the 30 minute time limit is too short, I thought I'd be a helpful Chicagoan and give some background and tips.First, Divvy was never meant to be a service for tourists to ride up and down the lakefront all day. Divvy is essentially for what is referred to as \"the last mile\". For example, my dentist is a mile from the brown line stop so I can walk 20 minutes or I can jump on Divvy. Many Chicagoans also commute on them (if their office is a ways from Union Station for example). Personally, I ride it the roughly 3 miles into downtown from home and back which saves me a crowded train ride and cuts my commute by 20 minutes. So there's some background.If Divvy can also provide a fun and interesting way to see the city for tourists, that is just an added benefit. When I see comments complaining about the 30 minute limit and saying that \"what people use Divvy for is to see the lakefront\" I suspect the commenter is not familiar with urban areas and does not understand the service.So how and why can you use Divvy on a trip to Chicago?1. you're in a small group (< 4). Most Divvy stations rarely have 4+ bikes available. Why? Because bikes come and go and people are jumping from one place to the other.2. you're comfortable on a bike. Divvy bikes are heavy...so that people don't steal them and because they were never meant to be used to toodle around the lakefront for hours. I run marathons and it took me a week of commuting for my quads not to burn. Also, Chicago drivers are getting better but they still tend to speed around cyclists and not look before opening doors.3. you understand the system. $7 for 24 hrs does NOT mean you get the bike for 24 hrs. Divvy doesn't want bikes out of the system for 24 hrs. Also, they don't want you locking them up (or potentially getting them stolen). Re-dock the bike and get a new one when you need it. (Yes, I understand the lines can be long and check in is a process. Because the system is aimed towards annual members who can grab a bike and go that last mile...)4. you've downloaded an app to find stations and available bikes. Divvy doesn't have an app but they do share data freely so many apps are available by developers using the data. This will allow you to plot out where you're going and ensure there are bikes and/or free docks. If you don't know what an app is, I definitely don't recommend that you Divvy =)If you're in a sizeable group and/or want to ride around the lakefront all day, parking it, picnicking, visiting the zoo, etc, rent an actual bike. I don't know the services' names but I'm certain there is at least one on Navy Pier and area bike shops likely do the same.\n",

I was shocked at how much I could see in such a short time. You definitely get a different view of the city riding down the streets than you would riding the L or sitting in the backseat of a cab. There are quite a few apps to help you find local stations, just make sure your phone doesn't run out of battery! It also helped that my friends, the locals, knew where docking stations were. Customer service isn't great, but if you can't dock your bike for some reason, they can extend you another 15 minutes. There are a LOT of stations around, so the next one is usually only 5 minute walk away.Most of the city is pretty flat so it was a very easy ride, especially for me and I am quite out of shape and don't do any regular exercise. This was definitely a fun experience and I'd absolutely recommend it to anyone. I hope other cities I visit have similar programs!\n",

      "I am from Chicago and a member of the Divvy program which is run the same way as the Capital Bikes program in D.C. along with some other city bike programs.Things to know:*You can buy a 24 hour or 3 day pass*This pass is good for unlimited use in that time frame however, you must re-dock your bike every 30 minutes in order to not be charged excess usage fees*You swipe a credit card to get started following the onscreen instructions*You will receive a 5 digit code which you can use to unlock any of the bikes at the station*Be aware that if a bike needs servicing, the seat may be turned around to show that it should not be selected or the red light will be lit so you cannot un-dock it*I suggest you set your seat height, numbered for future rental use, and any bags in the open sided basket before you enter the code to remove the bike*To remove the bike you may have to lift the rear of the bike to angle it out of its dock*Get on, make sure the bike work, watch for traffic and roll*Re-dock your bike, go back to the kiosk and re-swipe your credit card to get a new release code to take a bike back out. The wait time to re-dock and get a new bike is about 30 seconds I believe. Use the same credit cardI highly recommend you download the free app CycleFinder which will show you the location of other docks and offers a timer. There are 3000 Divvy's and about 300 stations mostly in the Loop, Near north, north and near west sides of the city. There are some south in Pilsen and Hyde Park as well. It’s a great way to roll around Chicago, however you need to be certain you stay on streets and not end up on Lake Shore Drive. Rules of the road apply and you should not ride on Michigan Ave. as well as a safety precaution. Be smart, there are plenty of bike lanes and easier streets to ride to get to where you need to go. Do not leave your bike unattended as you are responsible for it. Be courteous when you ride and do not run over pedestrians, they have the right of way over cyclists. Have fun and be safe!If you are a cyclist and interested in riding with others, please check out ChicagoCyclingClub.Org for scheduled free rides in and around Chicago\n",

If you want to get around town and not hoof it, this will do the trick. 30 minutes isn't a lot of time to gain a real long distance unless you are on Lakeshore trail. A bike map of Chicago would have been helpful. Dearborn goes one way north with a dedicated SAFE bike lane. I would guess there is a south bound as well. The bike is a BEAST. Heavy and not great for weaving in and out of large crowds. Found it much more enjoyable early in the AM with no one around. These stations are all around, and some are staffed with employees to help. Some of the bikes I had trouble adjusting the seat. They are rentals, and as Seinfeld said, \"give me the insurance because I am going to beat the h#ll out of this\". I liked it, wife did not if that helps.\n",

      "I am not a visitor so I was not at a busy site. There was a little bit of learning the first time I used it and it was dark adding to my confusion. Once I I got the hang of it it was great. I picked up a bike when I got off the subway at the Illinois Center, dropped the bike off a work. At lunch ran an errand to a book store - dropped the bike off 2 blocks away and then found a divvy next to the store. Rode back to the Illinois center to renew my driver's license. Rode back to work. then rode back to the El when the day was over.It looks like they are expanding the system. More bikes are at the Divvy locations near me - looks like it is doubled. One hang up was when there was someone video taping the system and I had to shoo her away so I could get a bike. I had no trouble with my credit cards but it is good to know about the 2 bike limit per card. I am planning to buy the 1 year membership for $75. Sounds like a good deal. I can use it everyday to ride from El to work.One concern - you need to bring your own helmet.\n",

      "While on a trip to downtown, having family from out of town, we rented five bikes on Lake Shore Drive. We found the $7/ day price was reasonable and bikes were solid but that is where good part of review ends. Onto the bad part. First, at busy locations there is always a line. Many are first time users, like us, so check out takes forever. With only one terminal be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes. In addition, card readers on the terminal are horrible and reject most of transactions. As credit card swipe is the last step in the check out, you go thru multiple screens entering info to get \"can't read your card\" message at the end. Many patient folks tried number of times but others walked away. Second, if you are renting multiple bikes, you need multiple cards as there is a limit of two per card. After the check out you get a code to unlock your bike, but as the check out process takes forever, you may get code on one card, but by the time you get another one on another your five minutes may be up on the first one. As the customer service on the phone couldn't help you need to get in line again to get a set of new codes....another 15-20 minutes. Third, the 30 minutes limit puts you always in rush not knowing where the stations are or if there will be space to return them causing a bit of anxiety. They will charge you $2 per bike if you don't \"check them in\" before your 30 minutes are up. Fourth, getting or returning 5 bikes can be a huge challenge as either there are not enough bikes at the station or not enough empty ports to return them. In summary, rent at your own risk. Be prepared to got thru pains but riding the bike in the city is fun.\n",

      "Terrific way to see Chicago assuming you can go with the flow and deal with chaos. This new bike system deserves support, because it’s much more ecological and fun to ride bikes than to travel like snails on buses or, even worse, moles in the underground subway. Instead of identifying and catching the right public transport, we decided one day to try out the Divvy bikes and simply head in the direction of the Willis Tower. Because it was Easter Sunday, traffic was minimal, and it was great to take advantage of the weather outdoors. Once we arrived, we locked up the bikes in the nearby station, walked around, and acted like tourists. Then we decided to ride across town to get a view *of* the Willis Tower from the Hancock. So as customary, we dutifully reentered the same credit card into the dispensing machine, renewed our codes, chose two new bikes, adjusted the seats, and rode quickly through different sections, along the river, etc. It was all very pleasant.Unfortunately, the Achilles’ heel of Divvy Bikes is the system, itself. It’s new and has issues. First and foremost, it’s not always easy to find docking stations. There may be an App for this, but we didn't have it. As a result, we were always at the mercy of our eyesight, someone in the neighborhood, or our sixth sense. Don’t assume that just because you want to go to an attraction, there’s going to be a place to park right next door. And a Divvy Bike isn't something you want to park just anywhere. For one thing, you get penalized after 30 minutes. For another, you’re liable for $1,200 if it gets stolen. Second, it’s invariable that things can and will go wrong. For example, after we left the Hancock Tower, we couldn't find a docking station. When we finally did, it wouldn't accept our credit card. The system – like many others in Chicago – was plagued by software upgrade quirks, at least this is what was explained to me over the phone by one of the many Divvy folks whom I called during our two rentals. On this particular occasion, we had to walk to the next docking station which was several blocks away and, again, hard to find. After at least a mile of searching, we found one, but by that point, we felt as if we could have made it home by foot.The next day, we docked our bikes at the museum plaza near the Field Museum. It had taken nearly 30 minutes to get there. Unfortunately, to re-rent bikes, we needed to wait in a line of 10 people, some of whom were trying to rent for the first time, all of whom were having problems. The machine was being uncooperative (because of the aforementioned software update issues), and each person tried at least twice before giving up. After waiting for three of four people to fail, WE gave up and walked back to the lake on our own. Eventually, since there weren't any other docking stations, we walked all the way home.On the last day, we tried Divvy bikes again. This time, we rode from the Hotel to the Lincoln Park Zoo along Lake Michigan. It was a great bike ride and required making one bike exchange along the way. There was a Divvy representative there to greet folks and check to see if everything was going alright. At that point, everything was, but when we got to the zoo, we discovered that, contrary to what we had been told, there was place to park. So again, I called Divvy bikes and explained the situation. They granted us an extension so that we could at least spend time at the zoo, albeit with bikes in tow. Finally, on our way back, I got a flat tire, so it took even longer get both bikes back to the closest docking station (which we found out of luck). Once they were docked, I called Divvy Bikes, and they removed the charges, but we were obligated to take a snail bus home from the beginning of Michigan Avenue. The Divvy folks – all of whom were heavily accented -- provide good service and were quite helpful, but they're at the mercy of the Divvy system. Twice they decided that the “resolution” was simply to reimburse us. Frankly, though, $7 isn't much of a hardship, so a refund doesn't make a huge difference. All in all, I believe the concept of Divvy Bikes is fantastic, and I’m glad there are as many bikes as there are today. When it works, it's great. Who can beat riding bikes around the city? Unfortunately, it’s nowhere near the level of perfection required by tourists. Hopefully they can fix the software issues, add more docking stations in less conspicuous places, and maybe introduce an app that can guide you in the right direction and even allow you to renew codes from your own mobile device. Additionally, I would welcome the option of hour-long rentals instead of 30 minutes – say for $12 per day instead of $7 -- which would help happy wanderers relax instead of constantly worrying about where to park.\n",

      "Decided to buy a travelzoo voucher to go around Chicago without moving the car and paying for parking. Great deal $4 for 24 hr rental. You can use this for up to 30 mins each time and it is unlimited. Sounds weird cause you want to use the bike for more than 30 mins but it works perfect. The bikes are good for visiting places and dropping them at their stations which are almost every 3 blocks in downtown Chicago. So we went to Navy Pier drop the bike, come back and grab the bike and ride to magnificent mile and drop the bikes, do shopping, then grab the bikes, go to the French market, etc. You save a lot of time by moving with the bikes and it is a lot of fun. Normally the price is $7 per day.Also I don't trust Chicago drivers but they are pretty good since there is bikers all over the city. I was uneasy at the beginning but it went away after the first ride.Tip: bring your smartphone cause that helps you find all the stations where to drop and pick up the bikes and also it helps you find the spots you want to stop. Also you need a credit cardNext time I will totally do it again\n",

      "This is a great way to see Chicago at your own pace and on your own itenerary. For a few dollars ($7 when I was in Chicago) you can get a day pass and all you need to do is bike from one location to the next withing 30 minutes. There are plenty of locations all over the city and there is always one close to the major sights. If the location does not have open slots to return the bike, you get another 15 minutes to return it to the next station. Get the online app for your SmartPhone to see where the locations are and how many bikes and open slots are available. Once you return your bike, you can immediately take a new one. Great way to see Chicago if you are a little bit familiar with the city.\n",

I used my credit card and away I went. I am 6 ft 3 and I was able to raise the seat so I was riding comfortably. Three gears made for easy peddling. In the center city you have to be alert, but the marked bike lanes are a big help. As a first time rider I also received a discount coupon from a Divvy attendant who happened to be at my station. I'll be taking another ride with them for sure.\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': 'So I got my first Divvy bike with a 30 mins pass to get to university. The bike was not bad I just had to adjust the height of the seat. Some people said that the bikes are heavy and it is hard to ride them. Well they are not entirely wrong. The bike was heavier than usual and it only had 3 gears so you could not go very fast with it, but I cannot say that it was very hard to ride, it was ok.I got my pass via the Divvy mobile app. You can download it from app store and google play. I am going to be honest with you, the app officially sucks! After refreshing and reseting multiple times I was able to get to the page that gives the pass. After paying the fee the app gives you a code that you enter on the keyboard next to your chosen bike and the dock releases it for you. Then a timer appears on the app that counts your riding time. You can also buy passes at the station but I should warn you that they do only accept credit cards (no debit cards or gift cards).There is a map on the app that shows you where is each station and how many bikes and empty docks it has. When you wanna get a bike you touch the plan a ride button on the app. Since it is 3$ for only 30 minutes you have to be careful and plan your ride ahead and make sure there are empty docks at your destination. When you wanna return the bike you just have to take it to an empty dock and push the bike forward until the dock grabs it. Then a green light appears that means the bike is successfully attached. Be careful if you do not put back the bike correctly you could be charged for a very long time. To make sure, you can refresh the app and the timer on top of it disappears. To sum up, I think that this is a good service that still needs work, but if you are looking for a healthy and cheap way to get around I definitely recommend it.'},\n",

Let me start by saying that the bike I rode was smooth, the experience of riding in Chicago was both exhilarating and satisfying. I highly recommend giving it a try and I hope they remain in service for a long time to come. Today was the first day that I attempted to buy a pass and ride a bike. I bought my pass using the app, located the nearest dock, followed the process of keying in the code to unlock the bike, the lights first turned orange and then green. I put my hand on the handle bar to pull it off the dock and it stayed put. No matter what I tried I could not take the bike off the dock. I realized that the bike never unlocked for whatever be the reason. I looked the FAQs in the app, there is nothing there about troubleshooting unlocking a bike (code correct but dock didn\\'t disengage lock) I called their call center and was on hold for 10 minutes, in the end I did not get to speak with anyone. The app displays the unlock code only once, I could not use the code to unlock a different bike. You are made to provide your phone number and email address however the code is neither emailed to you nor texted. Neither could I purchase another pass. It was all very frustrating, the app just displayed the time elapsed, calories, start point end point. I headed to the kiosk and purchased another pass with the intention of appealing for a refund at a later time. With the new code in hand I successfully unlocked a bike and tried to key in my destination in the Divvy app in order to point to the closest dock to my destination. Lo and behold there was a button at the bottom of the map \"Unlock Bike\" I don\\'t know whether I\\'ll be able to use the loaded pass for my return trip but I will try and see. I wont need a refund if it works. There needs to be better instruction, troubleshooting, the user experience of the app definitely needs a little more thought and improvement. Will I rent another Divvy? Absolutely and so should you!'},\n",

So you will have to use multiple credit cards if you have more than4 to rent.Also, use the divvy locator app to find stations close to where you are and how many bikes are there. So when you want to turn them back in you have to find a station with enough empty spots. Kind of a challenge with a large group. And we had problems at the first station because there were two defective bikes that we couldn’t release from the stand. I ended up calling the customer service line three times and visiting two stands before getting all the bikes. The touch screen at the kiosk was hard to use (screen couldn’t read our button pressing). And once you pay and get the code to release the bikes you only have 5 minutes before it expires. Some would take the code right away and some you had to enter several times before accepting. If you go past 5 minutes you have to re-dock all the bikes and start all over. AND if you plan on taking a nice leisurely bike ride on the Lakeshore Trail, forget about it. There are way too many people that apparently are training for the Tour de France or something because they are flying around at top speeds, yelling at you if you aren’t accommodating them. I had 13 year olds and even though it said you had to be 16, they were fine on these bikes. Easy to ride even though they are well-broken in at this point.

I downloaded the Divvy App on my phone having first checked it would be possible to hire two bikes using the same debit card. We successfully secured the first bike however when I tried to unlock the second bike I was presented with a message saying I couldn’t have a bike at this time. After numerous attempts we tried to use the kiosk but the payment was rejected. I used three Visa cards including an American Express Card. All were rejected.Eventually, I called a number that we found on the App (the telephone number shown on the Kiosk was alpha numerical so would not work in my phone). I’m sorry to say the gentleman I spoke to after a very long wait was super dumb. I explained very clearly and on numerous occasions what I had done but he was unable to think of a solution other than putting the one bike we had successfully hired back into the docking station and starting all over again (I tried this without success). Eventually after 15 minutes I suggested we try a different docking station and rang off. The next docking station was manned by a young women. We explained our problem and she said she did not know why the app would not work for the second bike. She did however say that the kiosks do not accept cards issued from abroad. Can you believe it! When it comes to payment processing the US has always been behind other parts of the world (e.g. chip and pin).She kindly offered us the second bike free of charge. A good solution for now but not for later on in the day or on future days unless we bumped into her again. I have to assume hiring two bikes on one card cannot be done with an international card. We had a great time cycling on the lakeside. We cycled for many miles in a very safe (car free) and beautiful environment. Come on Chicago. We’re not all American you know. You should be trying harder to encourage more tourists to your beautiful city.'},\n",

We rode to Lincoln Park, Wrigley Field, the Bean, Zoo, Navy Pier, Willis Tower, Field House, Art Institute, Soldier Field and several museums. The bike paths were easy to navigate, we saved on transportation and as a bonus had a mini workout!The paths were pretty level and the bikes have gears to help the small inclines we encountered. A few days later when we had to get to our boat ride at the pier, rather than taking an Uber or Lyft, it was easier to get another 24 hour pass. We were at our destination in 10 mins! After dinner and the boat ride we picked up some bikes and rode back to the hotel.

I disputed the charges with my credit card company and they honored my contention and in the end I was only charged $9.95.If you're unfamiliar with the Chicago Metro area Divvy's 30 minute check in requirement and the fallibility of their network may cost you more grief than the convenience of their bicycles.The bikes are 3 speed and are generally suitable for typical short recreational/commuter rides.Their fee structure and use policies need to be more clearly stated and printed on your receipt and at the rental kiosk.\"},\n",

But, be aware that the cost can escalate if you are not careful. The $9.95 will cover numerous rides of under 30 minutes for the full 24 hour period. However, that means you have to renew the bike in under 30 minutes at one of the stations. If you do not, there are additional charges. We had problems with finding a station within thirty minutes and, on one occasion, finding a station with empty slots to renew our bike. Make sure you choose your bike wisely before taking it out of the stall. A few have soft tires, many are greasy and some seats are better than others. You use your credit card to rent and renew the bikes. We used one card for 4 bikes. But, that required that we all stick together so we could renew our bikes. Of course, we didn't think of that so occasionally went our own way. That created problems since our daughters could not renew their bikes. The time penalties are cumulative and can become costly. We found the thirty minute renewal time was not adequate. So, it is your choice to try to stay within the thirty minute renewal or ignore that requirement and pay the price.\"},\n",

With the coupon code, my total was $10.50-something. Then there is a sliding scale for the length of your ride: 30-60 min is $2 extra, etc. but as long as you dock the bike at a station by 30min per ride you are not charged extra. Using the bikes for transportation along the boardwalk(?) on the water nearby the Navy Pier worked well for me, my teenage sister, adult sister and uncle. We had no extra charges for leasurely riding from Navy pier to Belmont. We were all thankful for the 3 gears that you can easily change on the right bike handle for going up and down the little inclines along the path. What a beautiful invigorating ride! The seats are adjustable and the ride is comfy. I don't usually ride a bike and my butt wasn't sore like it is after riding sometimes.

Thankfully, one gave us 2 off the book bikes until we found another station!2) The time starts rolling as soon as you get your bike. In a few cases, we unlocked on, then it took 2-3 minutes to get the second out. That time counts against you.3) At night, the stations aren't lit, so we drove around for 45 minutes just looking for one! (hence an overage charge).

There are so many bike stations throughout the metro area it's nearly impossible not to pass by one to re-up the 30 minute slot. Made getting through the city a breeze and allowed us to make incredible time to see more than we thought we could! Not all roads have bike lanes but the sidewalks are oversized which made riding them there safe and not a nuisance to walkers. PRO TIP: the 30-minute time limit is their money maker. Avoid paying extra by downloading the Transit App from smartphone App Store and buying a pass for Divvy there. This allows you to immediately get your unlock codes on your phone. Best part -- you can re-dock your bike and IMMEDIATELY get it back (or a different one) for 30 MORE minutes without paying overage.

The pass gives you unlimited 30-minute intervals - maybe good for a Chicago commuter, but not ideal for a tourist. They were unwilling to negotiate the charge at first. After a threat to dispute the charge with my credit card company, Divvy agreed to a one-time 50% refund as a courtesy.

       "  'Entry_Content': 'If you are a tourist visiting Chicago, do NOT use divvy. I\\'m a Chicago native and rented a 24 hour bike pass just to commute to work. I had never used the service before. Unfortunately when I returned the bike 20 minutes after renting it, evidently it \"didn\\'t lock properly\" even though I was physically unable to remove the bike from the lock (I checked). Because of this, I was charged $80 for the time it took for an associate to notice the problem, even though I had returned the bike within the 30 min period. For reference, the annual pass is $99. I was so disappointed with the customer service and the exorbitant fee Divvy charged, especially when the name of the pass (24 hour pass) is extremely misleading for tourists. I would not recommend this service under any circumstances, because the mistake I made was impossible for a first time user to know, and it was extremely costly to do so. '},\n",

After 20-30 mins of hold time, the supervisor offered me to take 50% refund, which I refused to.I will not ride the bike again & will not recommend it. Divvy is making money with dishonest ways.

The other issue is that you have to dock your bike every 30 minutes or else you get charged an additional amount, which depends on how much longer you had between docking beyond 30 minutes.

Locals probably get year memberships but visitors can get one day passes $9.95 which gives you unlimited 30' or less rides. Rides over 30' costs extra, but Chicago center is a small (relatively) manageable city for a visitor most stations are less then 4 mi apart. The stations near big attractions like Millennium Park may be low on bikes but just wait and people start dropping them off. You have to use the same credit card at each station to identify yourself and get a new code. Bike codes unlock the bike. The few downsides: no helmet rental so BYOH and the kiosks don't respond well to touch as they should. The bikes are heavy and durable and are the step in kind - unisex. They fit most any height - I'm less than 5' and the hubs 6'. We used them to go from Lincoln Park, to 3 locations downtown, to Old Town and to different areas of lincoln Park. All easy. Good roads. Night lights in the front res blinkers in the back. Importantly - download CHI Bike app and it will always tell you the closest station as well as a map of all stations. Pretty convenient. \"},\n",

I love this concept of 24 hour membership and free rental. The stations' spacing makes it easy to get to destination without having to go over the 30 minute free rental. For longer destination, its easy to stop at station and quickly check same bike out for continued ride and another 30 minutes free. Did this in DC recently and had a similar good time. The bikes are heavy though and have limited top end gearing so that 15 mph is about as fast as you'll cruise, even if you're a strong biker. The three speed shifters have all worked well and allow for easy slow speed take offs and climbs. Easy quick-release post allows for quick seat adjustment (remember, about a 90% leg extension is about what you should be aiming for to allow the best efficiency.) The tire pressure has been good on all the bikes I've tested and subsequently chosen fir each trip.No helmets is the one down side to the system. I hope this concept is taken to every major metropolitan city in the world. We have a good one in my hometown, Denver but i haven't tried it here cuz this is where my bikes live with me.\"},\n",

I found it to be accurate in terms of alerting me to the number of Bikes and return docks available at each station around Chicago, which was a blessing in terms of helping me determine which dock was nearest with the most Bikes (for me to start my ride) and how far I should ride to if I needed an extended trip (based on where Bikes were most available to restart my 30 minutes).

The Divvy Bikes seemed to be located all over the city and the pricing scheme made it the cheapest touristy thing we did in The Windy City ($9.95 per bike for 24 hours as long as we returned the bike in 30 minute intervals, but we could check out as many bikes as we wanted within the 24 hour period.) It was brilliant as long as the Divvy Bike rental place you wanted to return your bike to wasn't full (then you'd have to find another spot). Slightly lift the bike to get it out of the docking slot and don't be too gentle when shoving it back in, so it clicks. \"},\n",

What you don\\'t realize is that lower on the kiosk it says that if you don\\'t dock the bike EVERY 30 mins, fees will apply. We rented 2 bikes for 4 hours & I got a $127 charge on my card! When you call CS, they tell you the bikes are made for short commuter trips that take no more than 30 mins. And if you want it for 24 hrs, you have to dock it every 30 mins. Divvy, let me ask you, who would rent a bike for TWENTY FOUR hours if they had to constantly dock it?? It doesn\\'t even make sense. If you have to dock it every 30 mins, then only rent it out for THIRTY MINUTES. As a tourist, you don\\'t know the city, we got lost several times & finally when we saw a docking station, we gave up after 4 hours. Not as easy to bike around a city you don\\'t know as it seems. But we didn\\'t mind since it was only $9.95. WRONG. I called CS and asked for a manager, I spoke with a manager who was very polite & eventually refunded me 50%, which means I got charged $54 for something I thought would cost me $20. I said to him, \"You can\\'t tell me that you don\\'t get this call once or more everyday from other tourists.\" And he pretty much agreed it is a huge problem. He\\'s even suggested to Divvy to change their kiosks. Divvy, this is criminal behavior. You need to make your fees MUCH CLEARER. Maybe don\\'t make $9.95 for 24 hrs so bold. You are taking advantage of people who come to rent a bike for a day & get financially taken for a ride as well. Make it clear, Divvy is for LOCALS who want a quick ride.

The big difference is, as a tourist in Chicago, you have to purchase a daily pass. The process is a bit tedious, sliding your credit card in and out at the kiosk each time. Often times you have to do it more than once because the reader cannot process your card. I found several kiosks out of service so you couldn\\'t check out another bike.Then the doozy hit. I docked a bike and walked around a bit in Grant park and grabbed some breakfast early one morning. Went to check out another bike and the kiosk said my bike was still out. Worst. Customer. Service. Ever. Was basically told to go back and find my bike and re-dock it because it wasn\\'t properly docked. Was advised by the Divvy Customer Service rep that she does not work for Divvy so she can\\'t address my account or other issues. Was given the bike number and told to look under the seat.Walked 1/1 mile back to dock. Looked at about 8 bikes until I found the one I docked. It was locked in like a baby. Called customer service again. Same representative. Acted like we had never spoken although it was only 10 minutes prior. How many people had she spoken to on a Tuesday morning at 10am? Rrefreshed her memory and she said \\'oh yeah\\'. Told her bike was docked and gave her the name of the dock. Explained it 3 times, spelled the street. (Where are they located????). She said it looks like dock is offline. When it comes online I will note the bike as docked. So, now what? How do I get a bike? Will I get credit for the time you think my bike is out.... so many unanswerable questions by the woman who doesn\\'t work for Divvy.Suffice it to say, I ended up walking 2 miles back to my hotel because the rep gave me a code that didn\\'t work and I just couldn\\'t handle calling back and talking to her again.God bless and good luck if you rent a Divvy bike and something happens. Waiting for some massive charge to hit my credit card and maybe I\\'ll be lucky enough to talk to the same disinterested, condescending \"I don\\'t work for Divvy\" customer service rep.Oh, an I wrote an email to Divvy customer service, the email address on their website.

I downloaded the app to my phone, bought the $9.95 day pass, but was told halfway through the day that I hadn\\'t purchased said pass. So then I had to re-purchase a pass using the same exact credit card and ultimately had to dispute the second charge to the CC company.Since Divvy bikes are for \"short trips\", you have to dock the bike every 30 mins to avoid being charged. We tried setting an alarm for every 25 mins so we could find a Divvy station to re-dock the bike and go through the whole process all over again of retrieving an unlock code, or you risk being charged for going over. There is, of course, an option to add on more time by paying more when purchasing your day-pass. Since I was trying to save on cash, this is why we chose to dock (or at least try to dock) every thirty minutes. Half-way though the day, we just gave up and said screw it, and just kept the bikes for however long we needed it. It was better to enjoy our time that way instead of worrying we couldn\\'t find the next station.Most of the bikes were rideable, some had obvious signs of wear-and-tear, some we couldn\\'t take out because they were reported as \"damaged\" (and therefore you cannot unlock said bike). I would have liked to see a basket on the front and someplace to keep my water bottle secure. There is a little bungee cord on the front so you can place something there, but it won\\'t fit anything as large as a backpack.Yes, I would use these again. Yes, I would purchase more time when I buy the day pass. Ultimately, you get a good view of the city by bike, a good workout, and it\\'s better than Chicago having no bikes at all!'},\n",

Download the Transit App (as of this version, it's green and like a sideways S) which tracks EVERY version of public transportation but is great for the Divvy. Not only does it show all of the numerous bike stations, but it keeps track of how many bikes are available. So, you grab your day permit, it gives you a simple code, unshackle a bright blue Divvy, and off you go exploring. There are plenty of bike stations in the downtown area, no more than 5 blocks apart I'd guess. And bike lanes everywhere. And downtown is not very hilly at all. The best thing is you can turn in a Divvy at one end of a neighborhood, stroll a few blocks enjoying the city, then you use the same credit card as your membership to get a new code and a new bike. One word to the wise - downtown is full of cars, taxis, users, city buses, tour buses, and especially pedestrians.

In any case, Divvy charges by the half hour. When going to pay the $10 for the 24 hour pass, the machines explicitly indicated the price. However, in the fine print section of the screens, they include a clause that indicates that one must dock the bike every 30 minutes, presumably for some sort of \"check in\". I did not see this clause as it was discreetly hidden in the fine print and received a bill for $80 the next day. This is not really acceptable for tourists in that they must pretty much be going station-to-station and checking in every half hour, rather than enjoying the ride and beautiful weather that Chicago boasts in the summertime. Also, it\\'s a bit dangerous having to check every destination point in a city that may not be familiar to tourists. In the end, I was not helped by customer service neither by email nor telephone as the fine print pricing was much more accurate than the deceptive large print pricing that misleads customers as to really knowing how long to expect their rides to be.

If you do not visit a Divvy station every thirty minutes, the costs will pile on. But the app does a good job reminding you when there is 5 mins left and points you to the next closest station. When you do return to a station to reset the 30 minute clock, simply reinsert the bike into the station and dip the same credit card you used to get the bikes. There machine gives you a new release code and you are good for another 30 minutes. Also, if you get to a station and there are no empty spots, you simply dip your card and it gives you an extra 15 mins.

The first 30 minutes are free and the first 60 minutes cost $2. After that you are getting into bigger bucks, e.g. 90 minutes for $6.To stop the clock you need to dock your bike at any station. And you can check out the very same bike that you just checked in.- To check out a bike. Since time is money, get the bike ready first: adjust the seat height, put your items in the front basket... Then enter your code. If you plan to ride with someone, enter your code simultaneously. Once you get a green light, the easiest way to undock a bike is to lift it up by its saddle.- To check it in. First verify the station you want to go to has empty docks via the Divvy app. Once you are at an empty dock, roll the bike in and lift slightly the handlebar until you see the green light on the left side of the dock station. That's CRITICAL. If the bike is not checked in correctly, the clock is still running and you will not be able to check out another bike.- 30 free minutes Vs. $2 for 60 minutesIt may be a better deal to pay $2 and get 60 minutes of riding than try to dock every 30 minutes. 60 minutes give you more range and allow you to get to your real destination. Of course, if you see a Divvy station along the way, dock your bike by all means. To get the most value, map your route first even before checking out any bike. The Divvy app can help you do that.- Practice docking/undocking Since the first 30 minutes are free, hold down your horses and spend 5 minutes to practice docking and undocking at your very first station. Then take off.- Last but not least do not ride on sidewalks. It is against the law, annoys pedestrians and gives Divvy a bad rap.Keep these tips in mind while you are enjoying your rides around town(s). In Summer 2016 Divvy is expanding to Oak Park & Evanston.\"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': \"We tried to use a Groupon on 3 bikes and what a nightmare for several reasons: The system to check out bikes is too lengthy even without the Groupon. I could only use 1 credit card for each bike, therefore I used 3 credit cards, then not knowing which is for what bike. The touch screen you have to input all the information is not touch sensitive, so you end up reentering and pushing harder for all the information it is asking you, several screens to go through, while a line is forming behind you. At the end of trying to rent 3 bikes it took us almost the 30 minutes to get the bikes only to have to re dock the bikes at the same station, yet we would have to wait in the line of disgruntled customers after we took so long. 30 minutes for anyone whether a commuter and especially for a tourist which it seems to attract is way too short. Plus we ended up getting charged over $30 on each credit card for keeping the bikes for 2 hours, since we wanted to avoid the nightmare of having to re dock them every 30 minutes due to the confusion of 3 credit cards and a line of people at the stations. Also there are not always even bikes or dock slots open. So, if you are a tourist for the day in Chicago, we recommend avoid the DIVVY bikes due to the fact of long time to go through the screens and it doesn't take all credit cards and the time limit of 30 minutes, you really only have 20 minutes once you get going to find the next nightmare dock. They are not helpful in refunding either. This is not the only poor experience we have had so be warned to stay away from DIVVY until they improve their customer service in many aspects.\"},\n",

We rode them from the Field Museum to the Art Institute, then up the lakefront to the beginning of the Magnificent Mile. Chicago drivers seemed pretty tolerant of bikes but it is a busy city so it helps to be comfortable biking in traffic. You are not supposed to bike on the sidewalk. The lakefront path is a very pleasant ride.The key to bikeshare is to use them for point-to-point travel of less than 30 minutes, not a leisurely bike ride, as the charges increase after 30 min. It's also a very good idea to download the app as it'll tell you where the docking stations are located - and importantly whether there are any available bikes or open spots to dock.

We parked by a station with some open bikes, and were excited to check them out. To our dismay, we learned that you are charged extra for every half hour you have the bikes checked out. So we came up with a plan to stop and switch out bikes every half hour or so since you are not charged extra. This worked at first, but was a huge pain and instead of being able to take a nice ride, we were biking as fast as we could to get to the next station. We stopped after about an hour to go check out the beach and left our bikes at the station. After spending a few minutes there, we decided to head back, this time deciding that we wouldn't stop along the way so that we could enjoy the ride. But this time, the machine wouldn't read either of our credit cards. We called customer service and they just told us to walk to the next station. We were pretty annoyed about this since we only paid for two hours of parking and needed to get back. But we walked to the next station anyway. Once we got there, it read my credit card, but said we still had a bike checked out! We called customer service again, and they told us we had to go BACK to the last station to check on the bike, even though we had all checked our bikes and made sure they were secure. So one of us headed to the car, while the rest of us had to go back to the station. Long story short, our 2 hour leisurely bike ride turned into a one hour bike race down the coast followed by another hour and a half of walking back and forth. The machines didn't work, the customer service basically couldn't do anything about it, and they offered no refunds or compensation. If you're on a timetable or a budget, these are a bad idea.\"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': 'This was my wife\\'s & my first time using a public-share bike system and we really enjoyed it. Primarily we used it along the lake shore and not downtown itself (we didn\\'t feel safe riding on the streets with so much traffic). In general the bikes were comfortable, easy to use and in good working condition. With that being said you really need to be prepared and do your homework. Once you pay your $10 +/- you can use the bikes all day but only in 30 minute intervals. True, this can be a challenge (that\\'s how they make their $) so you have to know where you\\'re going and if there is a station(s) along the way. I strongly recommend checking out their website and reviewing their policies, maps & videos before using this system. I also downloaded their mobile app which had an interact map showing all of their bike station locations. I\\'ve read some complaints saying that the app showed a station only to find, upon arriving to that location, there was no station there. We never had that problem. However like other reviewers have commented, we have rode our bikes to stations only to find that there were no bikes available to use (for example - aquarium, planetarium, museums, pier, etc. / typically in the afternoon & evening when everyone is looking for a way \"home\" from the touristy spots). It was no problem for us since we didn\\'t put ourselves in that situation of relying on a bike to get home from the popular destinations. Since we already had bikes we simply checked our bike back in at the next station, got a new 30-minute use code and rode our bikes to the next station along our route. Once you get the system down it\\'s a lot of fun and a great way to see the Chicago sites!'},\n",

During special events they have staff at locations like the lakefront or train stations, but those are rare. I just am not sure if a city of Chicago run entity or any entity for that matter can fully implement this concept effectively. The amount of staff it might require to truly pay attention to all the stations might be cost prohibitive.

We didn't want the bike for that long.The 24 hour pass is $9.95 but you must check your bike in at a check point every 30 minutes to avoid an additional charge (however the charge isn't too bad and still works out cheaper than renting a bike if you happen to go over the time limit.) The first day we used a Divvy bike our closest point was empty, so we walked about 4 blocks to the next point where there were very few bikes left. We jumped on and rode along the lake to Lincoln Park which was lovely. Due to the very hot, humid weather we couldn't bare riding back so hopped on a bus and decided we'd do an evening bike ride later on.In the evening we walked to 3 Divvy bike stops and all were empty, making the $9.95 seem a bit pointless for a 30 minute ride out of 24 hours. Thankfully at the weekend they were offering free 24 hours passes, we located a Divvy Stand but the 2 bikes remaining were broken, so walked to another 3 stops and on the 4th stop finally got a bike! Overall, if you can get a bike and only want it to get to A - B then this is a great way of getting about. It's so much cheaper than renting a bike, however the having to check it in every 30 minutes really takes the fun out as you have to keep clock watching. We did really enjoy riding the bikes and there are plenty of Divvy stands around to check the bike in, but well located stands tend to have no bikes resulting in a long walk to actually get one. I'd definitely use it for a lake front ride but anything more can be a bit of a drag and make sure you do your research to locate a Divvy stand to check your bike into after the 30 minutes!!!I think 30 minutes is too little, even if it got upped to a 45 minute ride it would help a lot more!\"},\n",

For $9.95 per 24 hours, you can zip all around. One limitation is the 30 minute limit per bike trip or you get dinged with extra charges. You need to trade in the bike at the next divvy stand before the 30 minutes is up and check out another bike (all on the original fee). Lots of stations in key sightseeing spots so not to worry. We stayed at a large hotel on Michigan Ave and found that the 30 minutes was fine for a ride to the Museum or Millennium Park or around the beaches. No problem and the kids liked the freedom to explore. And you know that teenagers are hard to please!'},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': \"Divvy is Chicago's bike sharing system, if you are familiar with other cities systems, this should be easy for you. Check their website and other reviews here for more info. Basic common sense and some planning can help. Bring a helmet, find a bike that fits your height before unlocking it, then you don't have to adjust it, however it's fairly easy to raise or lower most seats. Test that first before unlocking. There are no drink holders, but a thick bungee cord for holding a bag in front. Make sure the your valuables are very secure, as I had a bag slip thru while biking. Always make sure you have a destination station in mind, and a plan B if it's full. You can check online to see what's open, but it can be unpredictable. I always make sure to have several spots open at destination station before I depart. We've encountered a problem returning a bike once, due to faulty mechanism. Things happen, so if you have a plan B, you don't have to worry about it. In general the bikes are comfortable and sturdy if a bit heavy. They have gears and are easy to ride. Obey safe biking laws, and try to use the bike lanes. Make sure to time your trip, to accommodate 30 min. limit. There are plenty of stations so you can bike and stop to explore the city with ease and convenience. Join Divvy for small yearly fee or take advantage of a day pass. I surprised my husband with a mystery biking adventure all planned with various divvy locations. I now use Divvy exclusively for around town biking, the convenience saves me from lugging my heavy bike down 2 flights of stairs.\"},\n",

There are numerous spots around the city to rent these bicycles. Most are no more than a 15 minute ride apart from each other. Many are much less. For less than $10 for a 24 hour period, you can use these an unlimited amount of times. The only caveat is that you must check in at a station every 30 minutes and request a new code if you want to ride longer. We use this time limit to plan our day. We used the wonderful app on our phones to find where we wanted to go and where the closest station was at. The only time that we ever ran into an issue, was when the stations were completely full. In this case, you request a 15 minute extension for no charge and ride to the next station. We were able to get through town with ease, and saved numerous taxi trips. The bikes are well-maintained, and comfortable. This was a great way to ride along the lake and enjoy the weather.'},\n",

The other thing to know is that it is $9.95 for a 24 hour pass, but if any trip is longer than 30 min, you get charged more so you need to plan to take several short trips. We loved going on the lakefront path, but it was tricky to find. There is a cyclefinder app to help find the bikes and also a timer to help avoid the exra charges, and Google maps has a way to turn on bike paths, to help plot the best routes. We went from the south side to the Art Institute, Navy Pier, Lincoln Park, and Chinatown all on bikes. Great way to cover a lot of ground without parking and also getting some exercise!\"},\n",

We walked to Shedd.2) I checked in at the Shedd station before going in so that the process would be quicker after and rented 2 bikes. After our visit at the museum The Shedd station credit card reader wasn't working. Several people were around trying to get bikes and some were phoning but the only suggestion was to go to the Field Museum station (approx 10 minute walk). We had already paid for the day rental so we went there to see.3) The Field museum station was fully stocked with bikes however the people around the station indicated that this station wasn't reading credit cards either. Someone phoned and it was suggested that we walk to Michigan avenue another 10-15 minute walk. Would have been nice if the operator wouldn't send us to a faulty station. They must have known because someone told us it was down all day.4) Michigan station - we finally got a bike and got to ride down Michigan. Stations were well spaced here and we had no problems docking and checking in. 5) We walked through Taste of Chicago to another station but they only had 1 bike. My wide rode the bike and I jogged to Navy Pier. We got another bike.6) We rode along the lake to 360 Chicago and then headed back to Adler. When we checked in at another station it took our bikes but wouldn't read our cards. We walked 10 minutes to another station and it had no bikes. We walked to another station on Michigan and finally found bikes. The bikes took us a long ways but failed at getting us back. So much for my wife not walking much.

If you could take the one bike for 24 hours, no bikes would be available. 2. Each station has a map showing where the other stations are. Most stations downtown are within a 2 minute bike ride, maybe a bit more in the neighborhoods. In any case, you shouldn't have a problem finding a station within 30 minutes, unless you're trying really hard not to find one.

       "  'Entry_Content': \"So start with the positives - this is a great idea and a great way for tourists to tour/get around the waterfront area in Chicago (which is beautiful btw). However, that said, it does not work well on a busy beautiful Saturday/Sunday afternoon when everybody wants to ride a bike! So here is our experience -We easily picked up 4 bikes at a downtown location near South Michigan Avenue. The 30 minute check in time flew by and we went to check in our bikes at a location on the waterfront. It appears that location's machine was not working well - there was a guy there trying to fix it - the racks were full of bikes and there were dozens of people standing around wanting a bike but it appeared nobody could get one! Our precious 30 minute time slot was quickly running out and finally at the last minute a few spaces opened up and we were able to quickly put our bikes on the rack so we didn't get charged the extra money. But then the lineup for the machine to re-check out another bike was a mile long! So we decided we would walk to the next location (how far could it be right?) When we got there, there was 1 lonely bike in the rack but no line up at the machine! So now there were people coming back with their rentals, racking them up and then checking them back out immediately (which is what we would have done at the last location except we couldn't get near the machine!) So again we walked to the next location - right at Navy Pier - it was a zoo with lots of bikes and lots of people - so this time we stood in line and waited to get our ticket to recheck out our bikes. We finally got our new codes and went to check out our bikes - 3 out of the 4 codes worked so 3 of us had our bikes - the 4th code would not work so 3 of us are standing there wasting minutes of our precious 30 minute time period waiting for the 4th person to get the attention of an attendant who happened to be there and get his bike out! We used up that 30 minutes, racked the bikes up for the last time and swore we would not do that again!So how could this be better? First of all - they need a much better system for rechecking out the bikes every 30 minutes. You should not have to rack your bike and then get in line to get a new ticket. And 30 minutes is really no time at all on a bike - could the rechecking period not be made at least 60 minutes? So - try it if you want - but beware those nice sunny days especially on the weekend!\"},\n",

The system of getting tickets with new codes for getting bikes is inefficient and fills your pocket with garbage4. Do locals even use these? I am not convinced. You guys need to put more stations along the Lakefront Trail. This is where everyone wants to bike. Do you want confused tourists getting honked at in Chicago traffic...NOPE. 5. The on street bike infrastructure does not match the number of stations. You need more lanes and cycle tracks because Chicago drivers are insane and scary and the tourists get scared and ride on the sidewalks like idiots. \"},\n",

There are penalties for not returning the bike every 30 minutes so you need to keep track of time and location of bike stations. If you want to use a bike all day, it is more convenient to rent a regular bike. A regular bike will also get you a helmet, something that does not come with Divvys.'},\n",

You can rent the bikes for 7.00 a day, the down side being that you have to park them at a docking station every half hour or incur additional fees. The stations are all over the place and as long as you time your ride , you really can do it for just the 7.00 for the day. I would suggest printing off a map of the docking stations before you ride. The bikes are simple 3 speed bikes designed mostly for sightseeing and commuters and are built like tanks. Too big for kids and they do take a little while to get used too.

In two hours, we had to call divvy bikes for help twice. A helpful hint is to download an app about biking chicago. This app will show you where nearby Divvy stations are located, how far away they are, how many bikes are available at a particular station and will also let you set an alarm to let you know how much time you have before you need to return the bikes to a kiosk.

I rented a bike a few blocks West of the lake and biked in the bike lane on Illinois avenue until the lane ended and I had to become one with the traffic - a tad daunting for a tourist, but I managed. It also took me awhile to locate the lake front bike path from Navy Pier, but once found, I had a great ride to Lincoln Park and back in just over an hour. I have no idea what the charge for this might have been, but it was worth it. A beautiful day and a beautiful fellow tourist to help me re-dock the bike at the end of the ride. I overshot the curb cut at one point by a few feet due to pedestrian traffic and my idea to lift the bike over a curb was met with a surprise - these bikes weigh a ton! Lifting it even six inches was a mighty feat. Also, some of the \"flipping\" around I do on my bike at home to change directions from a resting point is not going to happen with these heavy 3-speed jobs. Not sure I would trust the availability, reliability and/or speed of these bikes to deliver me from Spot A to Spot B, but a loose, casual goal for one was a beautiful way to spend an hour with the rest of humanity on a lakeside Saturday and I am grateful these bikes were available for that purpose.

       "  'Entry_Content': 'This is a cool idea for getting around the downtown area and other areas close by. We rode around a lot over 6 days for relatively cheap. The idea is that you can rent a bike for 24 hours for $14. You pay the one time fee with a credit card and it gives you a code to enter on the bike dock. This unlocks the bike and off you go. The pros - cheap, many locations all over, an app that is supposedly great for locating bike stations (we were having personal app issues). Cons - you have to \"return\" your bike every 30 mins in order to avoid overage charges (you can do this as many times as you want within your 24 hour rental period), you then \"re-rent\" your bike and get a new code to unlock the bike (you must insert your original credit card so that they know you are the right person). You have to find a docking station where you are before the end of your 30 minutes - there are a lot but not always right in front of you when you need them and having to look at the website on your phone is not necessarily convenient, not all the docking spots work - sometimes you get a new code to rent the bike and it won\\'t unlock (you have to make sure beforehand that the light on the dock is yellow). Sometimes it won\\'t even let you return the bike because the docking space is not working. Then you have to either find another location and/or call the number listed on the machine. Sometimes the credit card reader is not working so you have to find another location - this happened several times for us and it was very frustrating. We called the number listed and they apologized and said they were having issues and added more time on our account for the trouble. All in al, I liked this idea and if everything had been working we would have rated it an excellent. Since there were issues I gave it only a Very Good. '},\n",

Unfortunately, the kiosks are bogged down, the bike racks don't always lock and recognize a return, the lines for the kiosks are long and more often than not, the racks are either all full or empty, so you have to go to another station.

Something nice is that there is a map of nearby locations at each station, including a circle showing how far a 5-minute walk would be.The bikes are really heavy (probably because of the technology needed for the rental), so it made it a little difficult to ride and make tight turns. Overall, we had a blast using the bikes. We rode up the Lakefront Path, which is a must-do when visiting Chicago. We used the bikes to go to Rib Fest and do some sight seeing.

There is a convenience and pleasure to having access to these bikes in a lot of locations. There is also a lot of room for improvement for the bike user. During the month of July, we have encountered these problems along with others encountering the same problems. First you get only 30 minutes from point A to point B, to find another DIVVY bike stand. This does not give you enough time to unload your bike, especially if you are new to the DIVVY and have to locate a drop off. 30 minutes about time you are on your bike and headed out you will lose at least 5 mins. If you are with a few people, they too have to check out and if there is a line of people, which we have encountered at various locations, your time is ticking aways. Then when you get to another location and there is a line you have to wait to checkout another bike. The screens you have to go through are numerous and confusing especially to tourists and foreigners, they don't have a zip code or a easy phone number, along with reading all the acceptances you have to accept from 1 screen to another and there have been a few occasions credit cards work at one location and don't at the next, along with have to pay more than $7 if you go over the 30 minute check in, which adds up quickly. We got to the point where we avoided checking in because to check out again and wait in the line of people who don't understand the lengthy checkout process, gets frustrating. Also, after a month of these encounters, we walked to 2 locations in 1 day to find no bikes in the racks to be checked out. Talk about being stranded in a city! Too expensive, not enough time to ride should be 1 hour from point A to B, stock the bikes and make the screen more customer friendly for everyone to use!\"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': 'The way it works... Go to a station, and $7 gives you a \"day pass.\" However note that in order to make sure that people return bikes, and there\\'s always a supply, they limit you to 30 minutes in any one stint before they start adding extra usage fees. You can trade in and out as much you want for the day, as long as each trade is 30 minutes or less. Our observation is that there were always enough bikes, but because the check-out process at the station is a little long, you can end up spending too much time in line waiting for people to get checked out. I think I would just incur the usage fees in the future to avoid the lines (the usage fees start small and then escalate at over an hour). They have an app where you can see the tons of different Divvy stations.We were there on a busy, gorgeous Saturday and rented our first bike at Millenium Park and traveled to Navy Pier and then up the lake shore up to Briar Theater to see Blue Man Group for a total of around 5 miles with one trade in the middle. Note that if it\\'s a weekend, and you think it will be gorgeous to go to the lake shore, so will everyone else. Factor a fun, but pretty slow ride into your calculations. Also make sure you\\'re pretty comfortable riding a bike in general - there are lots of pedestrians and bikers to navigate, and presumably you won\\'t be wearing a helmet.

Rode up to Lincoln Park zoo and further north and then down south to the Field Musuem and Shedds Aquarium.Would have like to have rode down to the Science and Engineering museum, but due to events in that area at that time, we were not able.I will list the Pros and Cons below;Pros - can be a low cost. Easy to ride, plenty of bikes and station to pick up and turn in bikes. Can adjust seat heights and riding along Lakeshore Blvd was very scenic and fun. After the 1st day I figures out to ride the bikes for about 30 to 60 minutes and then dock bikes. Checking out bikes was easy if card machine is working. We were able to rent the bikes for about 15 dollars a day if checking in as required. Cons - You can only ride for about 30 minutes or you will inccur overtime charges. Overtime charges are not that bad for 30-60 minutes or even up to 90 minutes, but anytime after that can be expensive. You have to dock you bikes and then you can check them out again. But if you were like us with 8 bikes, you might come up to a station that does not have 8 docking stations ( so then what do you do - you want to turn in your bike but no places to dock so you end up going to another docking station). Next you have to charge the bike on a credit card and only two bike per credit card max. If you were like me with 4 then I had to use two credit cards. At times the machine would not read one of my credit cards so I had to use my friends credit card to obtain the bike. You have to make sure when you dock your bike that you make sure the light turns green or your bike will not be docked and you could inccur high charges. If you keep the bike 24 hours without docking then the cost can be as high as $100 plus. Last day we rode up to the Shedds aquarium and was hoping to ride back once musuem closed, but when we went to the bike station, all the bikes where checked out. Would not recommend riding bikes in the city as a little to dangerous.'},\n",

You can only rent two bikes per credit/debit card, which we think is really dumb and inconvenient.

We tried to get bikes (under the same rentals) at a different time and station, and all worked fine.

Boy, was I surprised!The commute from the Loop down to Mc Cormick would have been $5 each way on the electric train, probably $20 for a cab and simply too far to walk (3 miles?). By bike it was an easy 10 minute trip while you rode along the banks of Lake Michigan. It was spectacular and such a great way to get some modest exercise while enjoying the glorious Spring weather.I also used Divvy to try out a great Indian restaurant across town and to later rent a car at Union Station. It was just to convenient and affordable, I just couldn't believe it. If you're tired of staring out of car windows or noisy trains, give these Divvy bikes a try. You just may change the way you get around downtown Chicago forever!\"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': 'Before we get a summer full of tourists reviews about how frustrating Divvy is and how the 30 minute time limit is too short, I thought I\\'d be a helpful Chicagoan and give some background and tips.First, Divvy was never meant to be a service for tourists to ride up and down the lakefront all day. Divvy is essentially for what is referred to as \"the last mile\". For example, my dentist is a mile from the brown line stop so I can walk 20 minutes or I can jump on Divvy. Many Chicagoans also commute on them (if their office is a ways from Union Station for example). Personally, I ride it the roughly 3 miles into downtown from home and back which saves me a crowded train ride and cuts my commute by 20 minutes. So there\\'s some background.If Divvy can also provide a fun and interesting way to see the city for tourists, that is just an added benefit. When I see comments complaining about the 30 minute limit and saying that \"what people use Divvy for is to see the lakefront\" I suspect the commenter is not familiar with urban areas and does not understand the service.So how and why can you use Divvy on a trip to Chicago?1. you\\'re in a small group (< 4). Most Divvy stations rarely have 4+ bikes available. Why? Because bikes come and go and people are jumping from one place to the other.2. you\\'re comfortable on a bike. Divvy bikes are heavy...so that people don\\'t steal them and because they were never meant to be used to toodle around the lakefront for hours. I run marathons and it took me a week of commuting for my quads not to burn. Also, Chicago drivers are getting better but they still tend to speed around cyclists and not look before opening doors.3. you understand the system. $7 for 24 hrs does NOT mean you get the bike for 24 hrs. Divvy doesn\\'t want bikes out of the system for 24 hrs. Also, they don\\'t want you locking them up (or potentially getting them stolen). Re-dock the bike and get a new one when you need it. (Yes, I understand the lines can be long and check in is a process. Because the system is aimed towards annual members who can grab a bike and go that last mile...)4. you\\'ve downloaded an app to find stations and available bikes. Divvy doesn\\'t have an app but they do share data freely so many apps are available by developers using the data. This will allow you to plot out where you\\'re going and ensure there are bikes and/or free docks. If you don\\'t know what an app is, I definitely don\\'t recommend that you Divvy =)If you\\'re in a sizeable group and/or want to ride around the lakefront all day, parking it, picnicking, visiting the zoo, etc, rent an actual bike. I don\\'t know the services\\' names but I\\'m certain there is at least one on Navy Pier and area bike shops likely do the same.'},\n",

In just a couple hours, we were able to see most of the sites in the Loop, down to Navy Pier, and around Museum Campus. I was shocked at how much I could see in such a short time. You definitely get a different view of the city riding down the streets than you would riding the L or sitting in the backseat of a cab. There are quite a few apps to help you find local stations, just make sure your phone doesn't run out of battery! It also helped that my friends, the locals, knew where docking stations were. Customer service isn't great, but if you can't dock your bike for some reason, they can extend you another 15 minutes. There are a LOT of stations around, so the next one is usually only 5 minute walk away.Most of the city is pretty flat so it was a very easy ride, especially for me and I am quite out of shape and don't do any regular exercise. This was definitely a fun experience and I'd absolutely recommend it to anyone. I hope other cities I visit have similar programs!\"},\n",

The wait time to re-dock and get a new bike is about 30 seconds I believe. Use the same credit cardI highly recommend you download the free app CycleFinder which will show you the location of other docks and offers a timer. There are 3000 Divvy's and about 300 stations mostly in the Loop, Near north, north and near west sides of the city. There are some south in Pilsen and Hyde Park as well. It’s a great way to roll around Chicago, however you need to be certain you stay on streets and not end up on Lake Shore Drive. Rules of the road apply and you should not ride on Michigan Ave. as well as a safety precaution. Be smart, there are plenty of bike lanes and easier streets to ride to get to where you need to go. Do not leave your bike unattended as you are responsible for it. Be courteous when you ride and do not run over pedestrians, they have the right of way over cyclists. Have fun and be safe!If you are a cyclist and interested in riding with others, please check out ChicagoCyclingClub.Org for scheduled free rides in and around Chicago\"},\n",

A bike map of Chicago would have been helpful. Dearborn goes one way north with a dedicated SAFE bike lane. I would guess there is a south bound as well. The bike is a BEAST. Heavy and not great for weaving in and out of large crowds. Found it much more enjoyable early in the AM with no one around. These stations are all around, and some are staffed with employees to help. Some of the bikes I had trouble adjusting the seat.

       "  'Entry_Content': 'While on a trip to downtown, having family from out of town, we rented five bikes on Lake Shore Drive. We found the $7/ day price was reasonable and bikes were solid but that is where good part of review ends. Onto the bad part. First, at busy locations there is always a line. Many are first time users, like us, so check out takes forever. With only one terminal be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes. In addition, card readers on the terminal are horrible and reject most of transactions. As credit card swipe is the last step in the check out, you go thru multiple screens entering info to get \"can\\'t read your card\" message at the end. Many patient folks tried number of times but others walked away. Second, if you are renting multiple bikes, you need multiple cards as there is a limit of two per card. After the check out you get a code to unlock your bike, but as the check out process takes forever, you may get code on one card, but by the time you get another one on another your five minutes may be up on the first one. As the customer service on the phone couldn\\'t help you need to get in line again to get a set of new codes....another 15-20 minutes. Third, the 30 minutes limit puts you always in rush not knowing where the stations are or if there will be space to return them causing a bit of anxiety. They will charge you $2 per bike if you don\\'t \"check them in\" before your 30 minutes are up. Fourth, getting or returning 5 bikes can be a huge challenge as either there are not enough bikes at the station or not enough empty ports to return them. In summary, rent at your own risk. Be prepared to got thru pains but riding the bike in the city is fun.'},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': \"Terrific way to see Chicago assuming you can go with the flow and deal with chaos. This new bike system deserves support, because it’s much more ecological and fun to ride bikes than to travel like snails on buses or, even worse, moles in the underground subway. Instead of identifying and catching the right public transport, we decided one day to try out the Divvy bikes and simply head in the direction of the Willis Tower. Because it was Easter Sunday, traffic was minimal, and it was great to take advantage of the weather outdoors. Once we arrived, we locked up the bikes in the nearby station, walked around, and acted like tourists. Then we decided to ride across town to get a view *of* the Willis Tower from the Hancock. So as customary, we dutifully reentered the same credit card into the dispensing machine, renewed our codes, chose two new bikes, adjusted the seats, and rode quickly through different sections, along the river, etc. It was all very pleasant.Unfortunately, the Achilles’ heel of Divvy Bikes is the system, itself. It’s new and has issues. First and foremost, it’s not always easy to find docking stations. There may be an App for this, but we didn't have it. As a result, we were always at the mercy of our eyesight, someone in the neighborhood, or our sixth sense. Don’t assume that just because you want to go to an attraction, there’s going to be a place to park right next door. And a Divvy Bike isn't something you want to park just anywhere. For one thing, you get penalized after 30 minutes. For another, you’re liable for $1,200 if it gets stolen. Second, it’s invariable that things can and will go wrong. For example, after we left the Hancock Tower, we couldn't find a docking station. When we finally did, it wouldn't accept our credit card. The system – like many others in Chicago – was plagued by software upgrade quirks, at least this is what was explained to me over the phone by one of the many Divvy folks whom I called during our two rentals. On this particular occasion, we had to walk to the next docking station which was several blocks away and, again, hard to find. After at least a mile of searching, we found one, but by that point, we felt as if we could have made it home by foot.The next day, we docked our bikes at the museum plaza near the Field Museum. It had taken nearly 30 minutes to get there. Unfortunately, to re-rent bikes, we needed to wait in a line of 10 people, some of whom were trying to rent for the first time, all of whom were having problems. The machine was being uncooperative (because of the aforementioned software update issues), and each person tried at least twice before giving up. After waiting for three of four people to fail, WE gave up and walked back to the lake on our own. Eventually, since there weren't any other docking stations, we walked all the way home.On the last day, we tried Divvy bikes again. This time, we rode from the Hotel to the Lincoln Park Zoo along Lake Michigan. It was a great bike ride and required making one bike exchange along the way. There was a Divvy representative there to greet folks and check to see if everything was going alright. At that point, everything was, but when we got to the zoo, we discovered that, contrary to what we had been told, there was place to park. So again, I called Divvy bikes and explained the situation. They granted us an extension so that we could at least spend time at the zoo, albeit with bikes in tow. Finally, on our way back, I got a flat tire, so it took even longer get both bikes back to the closest docking station (which we found out of luck). Once they were docked, I called Divvy Bikes, and they removed the charges, but we were obligated to take a snail bus home from the beginning of Michigan Avenue. The Divvy folks – all of whom were heavily accented -- provide good service and were quite helpful, but they're at the mercy of the Divvy system. Twice they decided that the “resolution” was simply to reimburse us. Frankly, though, $7 isn't much of a hardship, so a refund doesn't make a huge difference. All in all, I believe the concept of Divvy Bikes is fantastic, and I’m glad there are as many bikes as there are today. When it works, it's great. Who can beat riding bikes around the city? Unfortunately, it’s nowhere near the level of perfection required by tourists. Hopefully they can fix the software issues, add more docking stations in less conspicuous places, and maybe introduce an app that can guide you in the right direction and even allow you to renew codes from your own mobile device. Additionally, I would welcome the option of hour-long rentals instead of 30 minutes – say for $12 per day instead of $7 -- which would help happy wanderers relax instead of constantly worrying about where to park.\"},\n",

      "Hired the bike for the first time last weekend to got to the park for a couple hours. Thought I'd pay 12$ or something for the whole day. Ended up being charged $47 for 2.5 hrs !! Called customer service and spoke with a super aggressive lady that wouldn't even let me speak. Obviously I was told that I had accepted the terms and conditions at the kiosk, hence I was on the hook. Not sure what the intent is to have such a service in the city - if it is to reduce pollution we are not moving in the right direction - I will never use it again ! This is what I call a legalized robbery...\n",

      "My husband and I wanted to spend the day exploring the cherry blossoms in Central Park. We had numerous problems with using citibikes. First of all we needed 2 bikes. We are from out of country so we’re only using my phone due to roaming fees. You can only rent 1 bike on your app??? What??? We had to use the kiosks to rent the other one and it wasn’t easy - took us about 10 minutes to finally get another one!! Now we only had 20 minutes before having to return the bike to a station (they only give you 1/2 hour before you have to dock your bike). Because you are not able to use your bikes on the smaller paths in Central Park, we rode for 15 minutes then had to walk our bike through a path to get to another docking station. Same deal - dock our bikes, get another code through the app, and takes a while before I could get the second one from the kiosk. So we ride again for 20 minutes then look for the next docking station. We get to it only to find there are NO BIKED available at that station. Yes we could ride to the next station but the app shows no bikes there either. And of course you are incurring extra fees of $4 for every 15 minutes you are over the 30 minute. Oh and on the kiosk - I could only buy a 3 day or week pass, not a one day!!! Again - WHAT?!?? So anyway we ended up walking for the second half of the day even though we had paid for a day pass!!! NOT user friendly, 1/2 hour is NOT long enough, kiosks need to be more user friendly (at every kiosk I had people asking ME how they worked), we incurred extra fees because we could not get to the next kiosk in 30 minutes. I really felt like this was a huge money grab and we did NOT get value for the money we spent. We likely actually rode the bikes for about 45 minutes and felt like we were always having to look for the next station. I would search a bike rental place next time and rent by the hour or day! Not cool at all Citibike!!!\n",

      "While on a 4 day trip to NY my husband and I were a little apprehensive about cycling in a big city but on day 3 we gave it a go and it was the best decision! Getting from A to B was so much easier and we opted to spend the extra and always used the electric models. The bikes were such a quicker option and by ensuring we docked every 30 mins we were never charged additional fees. We used them again on Day 4 to bike across the Brooklyn Bridge, a quick Pizza stop and bike back - an amazing experience with great memories!When we return next year we will get 3 day pass now we know how it works - make sure you download the App beforehand and get use to it - the map showing available docks & electric bikes is invaluable.Really good affordable fun! \n",

      "We rented two bikes to get us around NYC. As you can't hire two bikes via the app we had to do one online and one via the kiosk which was annoying but not a huge issue. We first took out the bikes to cycle back over Brooklyn Bridge which was lovely, there is a docking staton at the other side so this was nice and easy. Once we got into the city however, our experience changed somewhat. The roads are so so busy and so are the cycle lanes (which are hard to find even when you use the app). We ended up coming out of the city and cycling up from battery park to West 46th street along the side of the Hudson. This riverside park has a brilliant cycle lane and is much quieter and safer than trying to battle the traffic in the city.The bikes are very heavy and can tire you out easily if you aren't used to cycling.They are however, good value for money, easy to use and there are lots of bike parks. 30 mins is nowhere near long enough though!! I wouldn't recommend them in Central park as the bike lanes are very limited and cycling on footpaths is not allowed, plus, by the time you get into the park and get going, it's time to start heading out to swap the bike before your 30 mins is up!\n",

The system was confusing for us and thankfully a maintenance person happened to be nearby to help us pay for and unlock our bikes. The Citi System is good for getting from point A to point B, but that is all I would recommend them for. The bikes have to be \"re-checked\" out every 1/2 hour and it was difficult to find a station to do this is when you don't know the city you are in. Also the bikes were a bit stiff to ride with no turning radius. I guess I would recommend this to a local who needed a quick trip to work or the grocery. Not necessarily tourist friendly, IMO.\n",

You would either have to be diagnosed with a terminal disease and have only one day to live or have a death wish to die on 42nd and 8th ave if you decide to rent bikes in this city... my LORD!!! Everyone goes in every direction all the time, red lights mean nothing and everyone thinks honking at everyone will actually DO something. Well it doesn't.... The guy you're trying to teach a lesson to isnt getting it..... so get over yourself.We rented two bikes, and unfortunately this app will not let you rent two bikes at the same time.... so we had to use the app for one and the kiosk for the other..... so that is something they could change for sure.The bikes were in good condition, some better then others. The seats with the holes in them were less comfortable then the ones without. The basket in front had a strong bungee cord which held your stuff down pretty good.When we first got to the first station, we didn't know where to put the code..... your code will only have a 1 or 2 or 3 in it. And the key pad is on the left. The kiosk prints out a 5 digit code which after you enter it the light turns green.... HELPFUL TIP.... after it turns green, you have to lift up the bike a few inches so you can unlock it.... they don't tell you that anywhere either...... We didnt have any problems finding bike stations to pick up and drop off. The later in the day it gets however, certain stations around Time Square and Chelsea Market were clear out. I guess that's what the valet Service was for ? NOT sure....Helpful tip??? Try not to go over the 30 min time limit!!!!! IF you do, they charge $4 for EACH 15 min interval you run over. If you have to drop off and pick up right away, just wait to the two minutes to sign it out again. When docking your bike gently put the bike in and lift a few inches so it registers it and make sure the light turns green before you walk away.It's a cool way to see the city, I'm betting that I expended a LOT more calories then what they told you (that was a cool thing on the app) as my adrenalin was pretty high... I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at one point or another..... I would use this service again, it was a little less terrifying around Washington Square and in Greenwich Village, but midtown was not fun during rush hour..... yikes And good LORD buy and where a helmut!!!! \n",

      "Be Aware of Extra Charges\n",
      "Recently returned from NYC and used Citi bike for our group of four tourists. While the initial process seemed very reasonable and easy, in actuality we had a few issues. 1. You have to \"dock\" your bike in every 30 minutes. This seems like a lot of time until you have trouble finding a docking station with room for your bike. For each 15 minutes in excess of the 30 minutes, there is an extra $4 charge which adds up if you can't find a space to dock your bike before you run out of time. You will have to ride to the next station, where the same problem may repeat. For example, our group was able to dock two bikes at one station, but there was no room for the extra two bikes so two of us rode to the next station. Then we had to walk between stations to meet up. 2. On our return trip we stopped to dock our bikes and found plenty of spaces which was good. Unfortunately, when we tried to release the bikes and continue, the card machine was not working and we could not unlock the bikes. Not to be deterred, we tried walking to the nearest Citi bike station...however, there was only one bike available there. We then walked to the next station and same problem, only two available bikes. At this point we gave up and called an Uber to take us back to our hotel. In the end, instead of an economical day of riding, we ended up with extra charges for the bikes and the cost of an Uber ride. Kind of a ripoff! On the plus side, the bikes were very comfortable to ride and in good shape. Not sure if we would use Citi bike again.\n",

Be a good rider and be aware of your surroundings, ride on the street and not the sidewalk, let people around you, and watch for people/vehicles on your sides. Be assertive for your safety and efficiency -- the safest place to bike is often in the middle of a lane, but move to the side when it is safe. Watch for people opening doors (especially from ubers/taxis) and taxi drivers moving to the curb to pick up hailers. Use the bell to alert others of your presence (including people jay-walking at crosswalks). The Citymapper app provides convenient directions for bike share.\n",

We use these bikes everyday, multiple time a day but as of late I feel the reliability and quality has gone down. Eight times out of ten there are either no bikes to be found or there are nothing but unusable bikes at stations. We were also so excited when they introduced the electric peddle assist bikes, but I almost feel like it’s a bad joke. Every time you find one at a station you are left disappointed to find that it is also red lighted and not in service. I feel they need to get a better system in place to keep high demand areas better stocked and keep good, usable bikes in service. Overall we like the service and will continue to use it, but would like to see it better maintained. \n",

Yes you have to return it every 30 minutes but there are stations everywhere a tourist would want to go and the staff make sure you know how to use the bike.\n",

We went all over NYC... with bike lanes and CitiBike stations literally everywhere, there couldn’t have been a simpler experience. I would definitely recommend biking Central Park, biking to the Met from there, biking along the piers, and across the Brooklyn Bridge. We had the best day! I’m shocked at some of the reviews below. People seem to be complaining when they themselves don’t dock a bike correctly. The light turns green when you dock it right. Very easy. \n",

      "My older teen and I used this service and it was pretty fabulous. The price was good and it was relatively easy to learn the system. However it was hard to figure out how to rent two bikes because the app thinks it doesn’t offer that functionality yet. At the kiosk station near one of the checkouts it said, “do you want to rent another bike?” So it seems a little dumb the brain does not know what the hand is doing. Also it would be great to have some sort of indicator on the bike of how long you’ve rented it because checking a phone while riding is obviously dangerous. We have younger children who were not with me so it would be great if there were an option for kids to ride. Understandably that’s not their market but as one of the more legitimate rentals out-of-towners would appreciate that.\n",

The bikes are a three speed bike so it is difficult to find the sweet spot for cycling in changing terrain. The bike seems to have more drag in the power train system than what it should be. This maybe connected to the generator to power the LED light around the bike.Having said that, they are perfect for use around the park. You can access them right outside the park, bike around the park, return the bike and be on your way.\n",

My route is not the key, the point is that I was able to do a segmented trip around Manhattan hitting many of my favorite spots. Just keep an eye on your watch so that you dodge the extra charge for going over 30 minutes. There are so many more docking stations than when I first used the system years ago.

      "We wanted to rent these seemingly nice bikes to ride through Central Park. I used the kiosk to buy the tickets for a \"24 hour rental\", only to find out after about the every 30 minute dock requirement unless you want to be charged more incrementally bases upon how far over the 30 minutes you go. Why on earth would we rent bikes for a 24 hour period and have to come back every 30 minutes?! Then the \"ambassadors\" showed up to the desk and told us of the alternative. Shouldn't one be there at all times to advise people? He said we could call the number on the kiosk to see if we could cancel that. Called, explained, denied. Terrible customer service on the call, and also there with the ambassador. By this time we had already wasted 20 of the 30 minutes so we docked the bikes and went elsewhere. Waste of $24 and our time. We just wanted to ride for an hour or two through the park, which no matter what we wouldn't have been able to do with the ridiculous 30-minute time limit. I saw the response about keeping availability of the bikes, but any time we passed by any of these rentals, they were always at least 3/4 full. I'd really like to get my $24 back. Because of this, I would not recommend. There are many other rental options for a flat time period and rate.\n",

If that isn’t bad enough, by chance, we returned the bikes we were finally able to rent at one of the stations that wasn’t functioning earlier in the night. We watched both bikes light turn green to signify they were docked, only to be told hours later that one didn’t dock. At 11pm at a night, after docking the bikes at 7:50, we were told our only option was to go back to the docking station and “redock” the bike, after being told by the agent they saw us attempting to dock the bike in the system. I have never in my life experienced a more flawed system, nor a more worthless customer service team. There was zero responsibility taken by the customer service team for the blown tire (poor service and maintenance), the non-functioning docking system (again, poor service and maintenance), or the way we were spoken to by the agents.

I called customer service and was told that i locked the bikes in at 32minutes. I asked to speak to an advisor so maybe she can do something on my behalf because it was really not intentional and it was my first time using those bikes and i wanted to really be positive about the experience. Also, I was maybe a minute late, but im human and its hard to hit the second mark, so it was so frusterating that i wasnt helped and after the phone call i felt so horrible the way i was treated by the supervisor. I mean, I might not have been a minute late, it just sometimes takes time until the bike gets locked into place which may have taken up these crucial few seconds to be charged extra. The woman I spoke to on the phone was pretty rude to me. I wish there would be someone i could speak to other than her to explain myself and to get a more understanding and helpful response.So overall my biking experience was great, but customer service and the supervisor was really mean to me.\n",

For example, to get from Midtown near Central Park to Washington Square, 30 minutes isn’t enough time if you obey traffic signals. Over 30 minutes it just keeps charging your credit card overage fees of $4 at 15 minute increments.Go figure a bank gets into bike rentals and figures out a way to charge you extra fees!!!But just like your credit and bank accounts if you keep close tabs and a nice cushion you can avoid extra fees. But sometimes crap happens even to the best of us and you get dinged. What sucks is if the place you planned to stop doesn’t have any empty docks. You can get a 15 minute extension to find another station but it is still inconvenient and it just kind of sucks. Most of the busy tourist places have a few dock stations within a few blocks but it still ruins your mojo.The other scenario that sucks is when you need to dock and there are no other bikes at that station. You don’t want to be a jerk but you also don’t want to give up the bike if you are trying to get somewhere. There is a 2 minute waiting period until you can check a bike out again, specifically so if someone is waiting they can take it. Fine if you are in a cool place but shady if it is dark out and you aren’t so sure about your surroundings. So you look at the app and try to stretch it to a station with more bikes...hope you make it on time!!!Overall, I would use it again but it might not be for everyone. \n",

      "Great ride on citibike on New York streets but cautious of every 30 minutes docking when u t a day pass for new visitors\n",
      "We just thought to have fun with ride and see the beauty of the newyork streets .. it was soooo easy to book your bicycle with citibike using ur credit card and mobile number.. but only tedious part was docking back for each 30 minutes when u take day pass with rent of @12$+tax total 13+$.. If u don't dock ur bicycle within 30 minutes of ur each ride then u will be charged 4$ for each 15 minutes u spent after every 30 minutes of beginning of ur each ride.. which means we r forced to dock ur bike within 30 minutes time frame.. which makes u clicking clock in ur brain .. when u r a first time vistor u miss enjoying ride as u always forced to think of docking ur bike rather njoying ur ride... but u will get plenty of docking stations all the time in ur way where ever u rome in new York City..Except that u will enjoy a lot on bike ride..I suggest first time vistors at least do a one time bicycle ride in NY street for a first time visitor.. don't worry u have nice and plenty of dedicated line to ride in almost all streets.Regards,Krishna\n",

      "We walked from Times Square to one of many Citi Bike kiosks in the city... we walked practically straight over on 42nd to 1st street then 1st down to 35th.The area between 41st and 38th is an empty lot and I would avoid the area after dark however, it was safe enough in the day.We rented it from the kiosk at FDR Drive & E 35 St and we rode down alongside the East River to Front St & Peck Slip... Google map directions state it's about 19 minutes however we took our time, stopped for water and took some photos so for us it was about 45 minutes...For us to dock where we did, you will have to cross the road just above Peck Slip... which is just after you get under the Brooklyn Bridge.It's a great way to see the majority of the bridges and just have a relaxing day in New York without the hustle bustle of the busy New York streets.I would highly recommend this for anyone going to visit New York and just do something outside of the steropical tourists, which we were anyways, but found out about this so it definatey took us out of that 'sterotype' mode.The online Citi Bike map is awesome to use and the mobile phone app is awesome as well because you can see how many bikes are at a certain kiosk as well as any open docks. Very easy to rent the bikes... most if not all rental areas are stations that accept credit cards; you get a code and then enter that code on any bike dock, remove the bike and awayyyyyyy you go!!!!\n",

      "Make sure you understand the rules before you sign up!!!! I got a day pass for $12 USD and actually got 2 of them over the course of 48 hours because it was cheaper than buying all those single rides. Keep in mind that it's unlimited <30 min trips! All you have to do is bike for 29 mins and then put it into the dock, wait 2 mins, then take it out again! that simple! but if you don't, then you're just inviting insane charges on your credit card. I used it all day for 2 straight days and probably covered like 45 km biking around Central Park, midtown, downtown, Brooklyn and all the way up the west side highway, among many other neighbourhoods. It's so easy to use it's crazy! Also get familiar with the bikes before you set off. Some of the newer ones have an updated gear system where you just turn the crank and there's really no set gear it just progressively gets harder or easier, which I liked better than having 3 separate dedicated gears to go through. The seats were comfortable and easy to adjust if need be. No complaints. It was 100% more fun and easier and cheaper than riding the subway, but not quicker so keep that in mind. You can literally go anywhere you want with these things, there are 0 boundaries! and for that price, it is a no brainer!\n",

      "So, I used to love renting a citibike to go around the city but what happened last Saturday really pissed me off. First, they said they were offering a “free” ride from 9 am- 3 pm because it was “Earth Day” so I decided to take advantage of it. I signed up, then received an email where I had to click on the link to get my free pass. I clicked on it and did everything it asked me to, which was basically get the app and sign up. Then there was no further instructions on the email or the app. I went ahead and used my card to get the bike because I figured they would link the card/ phone number with the pass I “downloaded”. I proceeded to enjoy the day and made sure I returned the bike before the 30 minutes went up so I wouldn’t get charged and even waited 2 minutes in order to get another bike. I returned the last bike around 2:40 pm. Made sure the light turned green, as usual and that was it. Then 2 days later, I looked at my bank account and there was 2 charges from Citibike, one for $13 and another one for $48!! I called to see what those were about and was told that the $13 was the daily pass. I explained I had signed up for “Earth Day” and she says “you should have called us so we could tell you how to get the code for that.” When I said there was no instructions telling me I was supposed to call, she said there was nothing she could do because I used the bike and I was supposed to have called. I let this one slide, even though I didn’t like the fact she can see I signed up for it and the hours I had a bike and still does nothing about it AND we’re supposed to guess what to do instead of receiving an email with clear instructions to call them, but whatever... I did use the bike, so that’s fine! When I asked about the $48, the lady said it was because I did not return the bike for 2 hrs!!! I DID!!! And I waited for the light!! I told her where I returned them and I even waited for the 2 minutes to get another bike!! She said all she could do was to refund me $8!! Are you serious??? This is so sad!! I used to love riding these in the city! \n",

      "We got the $12 day pass. The pass allows for unlimited 30 minute or less rides. Take a few minutes prior to using CitiBike in becoming familiar with the smart phone app. This is a very powerful tool. App has a map that displays Citi bike stations. Will display in real time amount of bikes and docking spaces at each station.Used the Citi Bike app in conjunction with NYC department of transportation bike map app . NYC has made great strides in accommodating bicycle travel, and Citi Bike allows you to take advantage of this. For those uncomfortable riding in traffic there are numerous protected bike only paths that are clearly marked on NYC DOT bike map. Suggest prior to taking a ride know your destination station, Manhattan is very easy to navigate. In the event a station does not have any docking station there is an option to get an additional 15 minutes , although I never needed to use that option. If going on an extended ride you can always ride for 29 minutes dock bike.....wait 2 minutes get another code and continue riding. As a tourist didn't mind taking in the sites for a few minutes between rides. In the event you get distracted after receiving your code and you don't enter in time , get another code....that did happen to me. A tip I would like to share is that if you are going to Brooklyn use the Manhattan bridge as opposed to the Brooklyn Bridge. The Brooklyn Bridge on a nice day will be a massive wave of humanity that is difficult to ride through as many do not adhere to staying out of bike lane ! The bikes are heavy, sturdy ,and stable with adjustable seat post with markings that allow for quick setting when changing bikes. Bikes have a front rack that can hold a small day/backpack and be secured with a strap.Summary of our day pass was 6 rides for a total of 18 miles average time of ride 23 minutes. Bike helmets not supplied...bring your own !\n",

      "Citibike is my favorite part of my 4 years in NYC!\n",
      "I have been using Citibike for 4 years in New York City for commuting, leisure, and when family/friends visit the city. It is such a great way for me to commute to work (2 miles through midtown, ~12 minutes). It is much faster, and a much nicer way to travel through the city than by car, bus, or subway. I really enjoy using Citibike to get around the city 7 days a week, and I love getting bikes with family and friends when they visit! It truely is a great way to see the city, as well as getting \"from A to B\" efficiently. I feel that any complaints I have read in these reviews are completely unwarranted, and have been made by people who have not read the agreement or understood the rules. Yearly members have 45 minutes bike rides included, while day trip users get 30 minute rides (before incurring additional fees). These rules are made very clear before purchasing anything. There is a deposit that will be held on your credit card, similar to when you rent a hotel. This is a necessary part of the program.  The Citibike app lets you know exactly where the bike stations are, and how many bikes/stations are available to help you plan your rides in advance. I have had only one or two issues in 4 years with citibike, and have been promptly helped by Citibike staff over the phone. If the 30 minute time limit does not suit your needs, I would plan on paying overage fees, or finding alternate transportation. Citibike really isn't suited for long, leisurely trips. I see it a more of an efficient method for people to get around the city - while enjoying being outside and getting exercise. Hope this helps answer some questions people may have!\n",

You then spend 15 minutes trying to get the code to unlock the bike that you already paid for. After that, you take the bike out (which had sticky residue on the handle bar) and you can enjoy it for about 10 minutes or so before you have to worry about finding another citibank bike location to return it in. GOD FORBID YOU ARE 7 MINUTES LATE TO RETURN IT YOU WILL GET CHARGED 35% OF THE RENTAL COST.

      "This is a great idea. But this issue I found was that some locations (not always tourist areas) had so few bikes.

As there were no other bikes for hire, I then had to walk to another location to get a bike.First time I was so shocked I didn't know what to say. The second time I was prepared, I saw what was about to happen and made a scene. The guy was so shocked I ended up getting \"my\" bike.It is also very easy to go over the 30 minutes and get hit with the additional charges.As a concept it is great idea and I loved cycling in Central Park and down the side of the Hudson River.

      "I'm a bit of a fangirl when it comes to riding bikes through new cities. What better way to explore a city than on a bike? New York citibikes will set you back just $12 (plus like $1.50 tax) for 24 hours of unlimited riding. All you have to do is download their app and buy a day pass. The app shows you where all the citibike stations are on a map and you can go to anyone you like a pick out a bike. You use a code on your phone to unlock the bike and off you go. There is one catch with the day passes. You need to dock the bike every 30 minutes or you will be charged $4 for every 15 minutes extra you spend on the bike. I guess this is done to curb cases of damaged and stolen bikes. It's not so bad to dock them every 30 minutes as there's so many citibike stations around New York. 24 hours of bike riding for $12 is a pretty great deal. I would recommend going to the west side of the island near the cruise terminals and grabbing a bike there. The bike path that runs along the West Side Highway is smooth and easy to navigate, plus the views are amazing. Ride down the West Side highway, through Battery Park and onto the Brooklyn Bridge. If at any point you get sick of riding you can always dock your bike and catch a subway to wherever you need to go. I would highly recommend using citibike while you're in NYC, like I said before the only downside is the 30 minute rides but it's okay as long as you keep an eye on the time.\n",

All that and it’s much less than $0.50 per ride - where can you get such a bargain? Yes, it is important to be aware of drivers - but now with so many of us out there, we have mostly taken our rightful share of the roads. It would be great to have more bike lanes that are protected by parking lanes ... but I guess de Blasio does not feel the “ownership” that Bloomberg did- so it does not seem like further expansions are to be forthcoming. Too bad, but it’s still an excellent addition to our transportation network. Hurray for Citi Bike! \n",

      "Citi Bike is the fastest, safest way to get around NYC. It's the perfect way to explore if you're a new visitor the the city. I've been a member for 5 years and I love it. You can of course buy a daily pass too if you're visiting. But Honestly Citi Bike is best for when you get out of the subway and instead of walking 20 minutes to your final destination, you can bike there in 5min! It's a huge time saver. And if you're worried about safety, don't be! The bikes are designed for you to sit higher up so cars can see you better and New York has some of the best protected bike lanes in the world! oh and the Citi bike App on the App Store or Google Play store keeps you up to date with real time counts so you always know where to dock you bike!\n",

      "This is my second time using Citi Bike. This is the fastest, most economical way to travel around Manhattan. I bought a 3-day pass and it was an enormous value for me. I love the convenience of picking up the bike and dropping it off very quickly then being on my way to whatever activity. The only drawback for me what's some kiosks, for some strange reason were shut down. This left me to have to go to the next kiosk in the neighborhood. The great thing is the app for the smartphone shows you where the kiosks are in your proximity and if they have a bike or a dock where I can leave the bicycle. The latest bicycle model available, allows you to adjust your speed without being limited to only the previously 3 speed increments. This allows you to take hills with ease. I bought a bike helmet at the Goodwill before I came to New York and I leave it at my friend's place for me to use. All in all I'm a very satisfied customer. I just received a $6 discount now for my next rental!\n",

      "Great way to get around Central Park at night\n",
      "Due to this being a business trip to NYC, we only had our evenings free. I wanted to visit Central Park and loved the idea of renting CitiBikes to view more of Central Park than if we were walking. The app was downloaded and we picked out our bikes after being given a code to unlock them. At first we couldn't figure out how to turn on the headlights, but then realized that the headlights and taillights turn on automatically when you start pedaling. There was an open basket up front that had an elastic band to tie things down. Yes, if you don't want to be charged more than the $12 day rate, you need to take it back to a bike station every 30 minutes. This was not an issue for us as there are stations all over the outskirts of Central Park. Fun experience that we would recommend to others. \n",

      "HUGE LETDOWN, charged for their mistakes\n",
      "LOVE the concept of a bike sharing program, but was VERY disappointed with citibike and their customer service. I was charged $164 because the sensor on the bike rack did not register that the bike had been returned. When I contacted customer service to find out where the charge came from they told me they could only refund me $60 of the $164 charge, even though the mistake was due to a faulty sensor/locking system on their bike racks. To make matters worse I rented three bikes that day for a 24 hr period, we were only able to use the three bikes for one trip. As we tried to unlock the bikes for a second trip, it only gave us one access code for one bike, so we paid for three bikes but only received one. VERY disappointing, not just that we werent able to use the bikes the full period we paid for but that citibike was unwilling to work with me to fix their mistake.\n",

      "I'm an avid bike rider and commute to work daily. Citibike advertises itself as a great opportunity for tourists but that's a joke. My daughter and I paid $12 each for a daypass - unlimited 30 minute rides. But the distances you can actually GO in 30 minutes are fleeting. 2 of 3 rides ended up being over the limit. One was 33 and one was 32 minutes. For that extra 5 minutes, we were charged $8.71 each. (They stuck tax on the $4 overage each time.)\n",

      "Citibiking From Harlem to Brooklyn \n",
      "For just $12, saw a lot of great sites in NYC! Started at Harlem 125th docking station, made way to Central Park. Plenty of docking stations to return bike every 30 minutes so as to not incur additional fees. NYC is really bike-friendly with plenty of designated lanes, just use your Citibike app to see where the lanes are. After hiking around the Park, ended up taking subway to City Hall and then grabbed Citibikes for a trip over the pedestrian-congested Brooklyn bridge...use your bell to clear the way! Then rode around picturesque Brooklyn neighborhoods that were all decked out for Halloween, along waterfront for amazing views of lower Manhattan, then into the cobblestone streets under the Brooklyn bridge. After footing around there, got a Citibike and headed back over the bridge. Highly recommend using Citibike if you’re looking for a fun, new, inexpensive way to see the city! Make sure you have the app and be diligent about watching your time and having an idea of where you want to go so you don’t incur those extra fees after 30 minutes! Happy Citibiking!\n",

      "my friend and I spent 6 days using citibikes in September. Like so may say, it was a major highlight of our trip. We did two 3 day passes and purchased the $5 keys so we didnt have to use codes. It's true you can only ride in 30 minute segments but we planned trips and the bikes are EVERYWHERE. Only a few of our trips took two segments. Whenever possible take the westside bikepath along the river. It is very fun and QUICK. Granted we had great weather but we plan to take Citibike whenever we are in NYC again. It was fun and saved us a TON of money. We were in midtown and could go downtown in about 11 minutes. People who complain here did not bother to LEARN how to use the system. Downloading the app and reading beforehand helps a lot. If you are uncertain, try for 24 hours. You will never have more fun in NYC for $12. TRY IT.\n",

      "The best way to get around Brooklyn\n",
      "I have hired similar bikes to this in London so was looking forward to trying it in New York. We had done an organised tour in Manhattan the day before to get our cycle legs and negotiate the extra busy tricky areas. We were staying in Brooklyn and used the bikes to tour Brooklyn, down the Hudson River and to Williamsburg and Greenpoint. The bikes were very simple to use, gears changed easily and were in good condition. There were always bike docking stations within 30 minutes of each one so we had no problem finding a suitable one. Make sure that you know roughly where they are but if you stick to cycle routes there seemed to always be stations. You have to wait 2 minutes between each docking however this gives you time to have a drink and check the next location. On one occasion there were no free docking stands but a quick cycle to the next soon solved that problem. I know some people bemoan this fact but I paid £14 for 24 hours for 2 bikes, travelled miles, visited areas I would not have got the subway to and had a great day. It is nice to be able to dock your bike and leave with no responsibility for it - time for a quick coffee and then back to a new bike. The routes we used were always busy with people and bike certainly seemed to have right of way where we were. I would hire one of these every time I go!\n",

We hired 3 bikes on a Saturday and then all the machines where you need to re-dock every 30 minutes all went down. We wasted time trailing to 5 different machines and eventually gave up. When contacting customer service on return to the UK, they are absolutely appalling; ranging from not replying, then replying requesting the same information on numerous occasions and then failing to find our account or any accurate information about our spend. Ended up reporting them to the fraud dept of our credit card company for not refunding but worse still, for adding many spurious costs - don't touch with a barge pole\n",

You need to ride from kiosk to kiosk to return the bike so you can ride for another 30 minutes?

      "The cycling experience in New York is great. Unfortunately we rented the bike one day and as there were no nearby stations (with free parking places), the half hour ride was impossible, we paid more for late penalties than for the whole day of service. Brooklyn is a bad idea Citi Bike in Manhattan is better, but the risk is that you arrive at crowded stations and you can not leave the bike and end up paying $ 4, $ 8, $ 12 penalty. Half an hour each time is a very bad idea, would be better 45 minutes, so give time to track stations with free places to leave the bike without suffering what I and my friends live.La experiencia ciclista en Nueva York es estupenda. Desafortunadamente alquilamos la bici un día y como no había estaciones cercanas (con lugares para estacionar libres), el recorrido de media hora era imposible, pagamos más por penalizaciones por demora que por todo el día de servicio. En Brooklyn es una pésima idea la Citi Bike, en Manhattan es mejor, pero el riesgo es que llegas a estaciones llenas y no puedes dejar la bici y terminas pagando $4, $8, $12 de penalización.

      "Can be GREAT....Here's LOCAL advice before you choose this option\n",
      "I've been using Citibike since it first started and am a long time NYer. Citi Bike NYC is not for everyone. Some of it is Citi Bike's fault. Some of it is New York's fault. Below is a guide to help you decide if it's right for you.1) 30MIN LIMIT (under 1 year pass)/45MIN LIMIT (annual Pass). The Bike is really cheap, except if you hold it for more than 30 minutes. This is great if you are using Citibike as an alternative form of transport from the subway. Less great if you are hoping for a long bike ride through the city. 2) DON'T USE CITIBIKE FOR THESE ATTRACTIONS: Central park riders will think Citibike is a comparable option to bicycle renters that dot the area. In some ways it is, because the rental companies often charge $30 for 4 hours and you won't likely need the bike the full 4 hours. Central Park is a 6.1mile/10km loop provided you know where you're going. This is a 3 speed, heavy leisure bike. It's actually quite aggressive to try to get around all of Central park in 30 minutes. You can likely find a citibike, get around 2/3rds of it, find a docking kiosk depending on how you plan. A little aggressive, but possible. There aren't Citibike Kiosks yet in Central Park, so you'll be biking in and out, i.e. traffic lights. West Side Highway is a better bet, but watch the clock. Due to weight, traffic lights, and limitations of the bike, I think from 60th Street to Chinatown is the most I can do in 30minutes (about 3.5-4 miles) including undocking/redocking the bike. But I am a marathon runner, who trains regularly for competitions and I know where I'm going and where the kiosks are.3) NO HELMET vs. HELMET. NYers are notoriously bad for using no helmet. At the current moment, you will not get ticketed for failing to use one. 4) BIKE LANES & TRAFFIC RULES. Sometimes you have to ignore them if you don't plan on dying. The US Is behind European Countries for bicycling. The way cars and pedestrians behave, it's more like China, circa 1990 or the Emerging countries of Asia. You have to stay alert. That makes it wild and fun for some, but scares the pants off of others.5) THICK SKIN FOR PEOPLE YELLING AT YOU. NYers are yellers. Cabs, pedestrians, and other bikers will often all exercise their freedom of speech to strongly in their communicate their opinion of one's biking skills. You want to have a humorous attitude toward this and see it as part of the show. 6) BEST AND WORST HOURS. If you're still not deterred, realize that rush hour is the scariest time and early morning (before 7am) is the most serene time. 7) AVOID TIMES SQUARE AND HERALDS SQUARE UNLESS THAT IS YOUR DESTINATION. Even the cars avoid these areas. If you bike in these areas, your issue is pedestrians and they are extremely clueless (sorry... I love you visitors, but you guys tend to be looking up at the buildings, walking in zig zags and at odd angles across the street and it's hard to know what to do on bicycle behind you).8) DOWNLOAD 2 APPS TO HELP YOU. Citibikenyc will tell you in advance whether you're going to a kiosk station with no bikes. This will save you from getting there and burning minutes trying to find an open Kiosk. If there are only 1 or 2 slots, I would not chance it. Citymapper will tell you how long it will take an average cyclist on a heavy citibike can get there. Even if you are a competitive biker, realize pedestrians, construction, and more can get in your way. Until you get a good sense for your timing relative to Citymappers estimates in bicycling, trust Citymapper. 9) DO NOT BICYCLE ON SIDEWALKS. It's way better to bike against traffic than it is to ride on a sidewalk. Pedestrians are more dangerous than cars in this city and you are in the wrong if you hit them vs. a car which will always end up with the ticket. 10) EASIEST CITIBIKE ROUTES. If you just want to check this out and need a path that won't incur overages, get the 24 hour card. Ride along West Side Highway (WSH) doing all the attractions along the Hudson River in order. WSH is by far the safest route, as there are no cars, just pedestrians and other crazy bikers for most of it. Also, you can get a bike at Cityhall or Chinatown and go over to Brooklyn Bridge (preferably before 10am). Park your bike in Brooklyn and check out the water front. Then Ride back on the Manhattan Bridge. Each bridge is 1 very hilly mile. The Manhattan Bridge is slightly less steep and a lot less crowded. If after 10am, walk over the Brooklyn Bridge. May not be as fun to ride it.\n",

      "I saw that almost all the one star reviews had the same complaint. They did not know of the 1/2 hour limit per ride, and they did not know about the credit card hold. In all fairness, this can be a major problem for those that do not know about it. Frankly, a tourist would likely be better off with a rental from a private rental company where they can have the terms clearly explained to them. However, if you live or work in NYC, there is no better bike option. All bikes are in good to great condition, and they do exactly what they are designed to do - give you access to a bike for a short commute within the city. Having the App is essential since it is the only way to know where the bikes are, and where you can dock them when you are done. I found customer service to be completely professional whenever I call and I have no complaints. The Citi Bike has saved me thousands of dollars in the years that I have been using it, and given me hundreds of hours of pleasure! Know the rules before you go, have the app on your smartphone and enjoy!\n",

      "A great way to get around NYC\n",
      "I am a confident commuter cyclist but was very leery of riding in NYC. After passing up several chances in the past, on a free efternoon i bit the bullet and rented a citibike hoping to have time to take in more of NYC tha i vpuld manage on foot. What a great choice. Renting the bike with a credit card was straightforward. I rode up to Central park and turned the bike in, you can't keep the same bike for over 30 min w/o incurring a surcharge. After looking at the statues, i checked out another bike (no new charge, the rental is good for 24 hrs.) And had the most pleasant ride around the park. Again i checked in the bike on cental park west. After scoping out a marked path to the Hudson River greenway, i checked out another bike and headed south, a pleasant ride on a multi use pathway. I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable and functional the 3-speed bikes were. The seats are easily adjutable to approximate a fit. There are no significant hills that require a lower gear. I will certainly plan to use Citibike as an alternative transportation when returning to NY.\n",

      "We LOVE Citi Bike. Don't make the mistake the bad reviews made and you'll have a blast!!\n",
      "We were in NYC to see a concert this week (August 10, 2017). We were near Central Park and decided to rent a Citi Bike. We made the same mistake the people in the bad reviews did, and I understand why they're unhappy. Pick the wrong rental plan and you'll be charged a small fortune. Citi offers a 'Day Pass' and an hourly pass. The Day Pass is not what it sounds like. It is meant for frequent short (30 minute or less) trips throughout the day. It's meant for locals running errands, shoppers, commuters, etc. Keep the bike for longer than 30 minutes and they charge you $4 every 15 minutes. The Day Pass is not what you want when you're on vacation, even though it sounds like it is. We made this mistake since I never read the fine print (which isn't easy on a smart phone, but...). The hourly pass charges $4 an hour, and the clock stops running when you check the bike back into a rack. When you want to ride again you pick up another bike anywhere and the meter starts running again. It's set up so you can shop, have lunch or just relax and only be charged for your actual riding time.Once we figured out that we had the wrong plan (my wife does read the fine print ;-), we went to the Citi kiosk at the south end of Central Park, where we met Tammy, a Citi Bike representative. She was awesome!! She explained the different passes, and told us why the hourly pass was what we needed. She called customer service and got our day pass refunded (minus a charge for the overtime we had run up) and got us set up with the hourly pass. She also told us a lot of great places to ride, gave us a map of the city and the Citi Bike locations, and told us about the NYC CitiStreets festival scheduled for the next day. We wound up staying overnight, renting a bike the next morning and riding down Park Ave (closed to traffic that day) and over the Brooklyn Bridge. Tammy helped me have on of my best birthdays ever- my wife and I can't say enough good things about her. She rocks, and she made us Citibike fans forever.\n",

      "DO NOT RENT: Very very disappointed in this service. They put hold of $104 on what ever card you use. I rented 2 bikes so that was basically $210 from my account that was frozen. This caused a HUGE problem since I have a daily limit, which doesn't work so good when I'm on vacation in NY. The deposit info isn't listed clearly on the rental stand. Once customer service was notified, they said we needed to read the waiver all 50 pages of it, despite a line of 5 people behind my group. The first CSR hung up on me after asking to speak to a manager. The 2nd CSR was so rude! I recommend renting a bike from 1 of the other vendors. The worst part of my vacation. NY was an incredible vacation for me and my friends. Sadly, this caused all 6 of us stress! \n",

      "Got charged ~100$ overtime fees on a daily pass!!!! :(\n",
      "I got a Citibike on Sunday. Since this was my first time ever using one, I called a customer care from bike stand. I mentioned to her that I have never used this service before and was in a rush. I asked her about the plans they offer and if I can take the bike on hourly basis. She mentioned that they only have 1 day, 3 days, monthly and annual plans. Since I needed the bike only for few hours, I went with a daily pass. The customer care representative asked me to spot a kiosk nearby to complete the transaction. What she ignored telling me is that the bike needs to be docked every 30 minutes to a bike stand to avoid a late fee. On returning the bike, I saw a humungous charge on my credit card of 100+. On calling customer care multiple times, every time I was told curtly that 'you need to plan your trip accordingly, '12$ is for system use', 'there is nothing we can do' etc. They adjusted the charge nominally on requesting a first-time courtesy but did not do it completely.This bike service is a complete scam and rip off. The customer agents are rude and this company is in business of making money based on customer's ignorance. With the amount of money they charged me, I could have bought an actual bike and used it forever! I want to question the rationale for this policy. If this is for bike sharing, the customers should be charged overtime only when the bikes there are less bikes available at the stand (similar to demand based pricing of Uber). The whole bike stand where I took the bike from was full! It pains to know that a large bank like Citi is sponsoring such an unethical company bike company! It seems both are not able to earn money by fair and regular business and adopting to such practices. Are consumer agencies listening to customer's plights and can this unfair policy be changed?Why am I being subject to something I was not aware of? Something that the customer care did not care to explain to me completely? I could have opted not to ride the bike that day. How does the charge of $ 100+ plus taxes justify using the bike for few hours in addition to paying a daily rate of $12 plus taxes and being liable for 1200$ for a lost or stolen bike? The company needs to train the customer service agents to give complete information and change the unfair overtime fees policy.I am simply not prepared and ‘cannot afford’ to pay 112$ as a bike rental for a day. I am sure others like you value your hard-earned money as well.\n",

      "My husband and I rented these on our second day in NYC. The first day we rented from a different company and rode through the park, not even realizing that citi bike was an option. We purchased the 24 pass which was around $10 per person. We then rode from Times Square all the way to Pier A and back.Downside is that you can only have the bikes out to 1/2 hour at a time. Since we were going a long distance, we had to make an effort to stop 30 mins in and find a station. Which was fine, except for the times that we came to a station that didn't have any openings to dock the bikes.Overall, it was a good experience and I would do it again.

Though do be sure to dock within 30 minutes each time. But with docking stations seemingly everywhere they are easy to find, especially if you have a smartphone. The main caution is to check your bike before you pull it out of the dock. Most bikes were ok but check the tires, the bell (bell is quite important, you will use it as you are in either vehicle or pedestrian traffic all the time), the gear shift. I had a couple of duds before I wised up. Go for it!\n",

It's really top notch, and I must take my helmet off to Citi Bike for being so responsive to the needs of their customers.If I could pick 3 things to do on a visit to NYC, they'd be #1, bike around using a Citi Bike; #2 go to the Gibson in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and enjoy their namesake cocktail, the Tecate; and #3 eat pizza all the time.\n",

Pop in your credit card- (never use a debit for rentals) and off you go. We thought we could make one loop around the park but with other bikers, walkers, skaters, poor signage we were only able to make it a little over half way before we noticed another citi bike rack. We popped our bikes back in and planned on taking them back out for another 30 minutes. The problem is the person with the original credit card was ahead of us on the path so we couldn't obtain a new code to unlock the bikes again. We ended up walking the rest of the park that day which was fine since the park is so beautiful. Renting from private companies at the park entrance is expensive but worth it if you plan on riding the whole day. \n",

      "First of all if you are a tourist - use your credit card because on page 2 out of 50 is a tiny print preauthorization agreement that you agree to a $110 fee for 48 hours on your card. We used debit and have a limit on our card each day and it halted the use of my card. There are 6 in our group and each was charged that amount. So, Citi used our money for 48 hours totaling $660 for our group). ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! Then when we tried calling to get it off the customer service department was extremely rude (guessing they deal with lots of these calls) and hung up on us. To top it off we downloaded the app to make sure we didn't exceed the 30 min - and didn't matter because we did anyway. We started at the base of the Brooklyn bridge and ended across it in Brooklyn and we exceeded the 30 minutes. (if they know it is going to exceed it to cross, Citi should put a station on the top of the bridge). Along with it being shady, you have 24 hour access to the bikes, but have to dock them every 30 minutes. FINALLY to top it off, my bike was broke and would only go in third gear. If anyone goes in third gear uphill, it was virtually impossible!!!!! Dont waste your money and go with a local bike company!!!!!!!!!!\n",

We biked from the top of central park to the Plaza where we saw some citibike employees. I wanted to ask them for directions and this guy said did you check your bike in? I said I just got my bike. He said you have to turn it in every 30 minutes and I said I rented it for the day. He said you have to check it in, I said that made no sense but went with him to check 3 bikes in only to see we were fined already $24! I was furious and told him I had never had such a thing happen with bike rental. HE THEN SAID WE ARE NOT A BIKE RENTAL! Oh ok - then what the heck are you? I said I am sure other tourists have the same problem and he said that is why they were there. He did not apologize or feel bad. I wrote citibike and got the same response about returning every 30 minutes. The concept is good but the random 30 minute time limit makes no sense. We saw locals even check their bikes in, sit on them for 2 minutes and then go again. As for the bikes themselves, most were in okay shape but if you are a tourist do you research and get a better bike that comes with a lock and let's you use as you wish.\n",

We met a couple that were unaware of this deadline, and had been riding for several hours. I have rented bikes in Paris and other cities in Europe before, no time limit, they work great. NYC needs to reconsider this 30 minute thing. Otherwise, the bikes were durable and solid and although we changed at 10 stations during the day, there was only one station that was full.

Long distance travel and enjoyment is what bikes are designed for. 5 hours later I found out from someone that I was supposed to return it within 30 minutes, which would never had occurred to me, because that totally defeats the purpose of renting a bike. This is just a way to scam ignorant tourists like myself. The bikes are for commuting to and from work, but not for tourists. They charged me $86. Even if I knew about the 30 minutes, it would be very difficult to impossible to try to rush around finding the next docking station, and not at all enjoyable. In 3rd gear, the bike will not even go that fast. All they would have to do is provide a pay by hour option, but instead they prefer to scam tourists.

I weighed up various companies inc Citi Bike which have numerous stations around the city and tourist areas. This seemed a convenient option offering freedom to pick up and deposit wherever.As I realise now it was an expensive option. Stations advertise a bike hire at $12 dollars per day. Sounds good? So I thought. The next half hour is included in the initial charge of $12 then it gets expensive. Let's face it, if your hiring a bike then 30 minutes is nothing if your stopping here and there to take on views, photos etc.Thereafter the rates jump to $4 per 15 minutes X say two bikes, it becomes a pretty expensive hire.On hindsight, I'd go for another option/company like Blazing Saddles even though it reduces hire and return options it'll work out infinitely cheaper plus provision of that all important cycle helmet.\n",

The Citi bike system is misleading & very costly.Go to a regular bike shop if you want to rent a bike in NYC !!!\n",

      "I got a day pass and used it from about noon to 11 at night. I was able to find bike stations all over Manhattan and in Downtown Brooklyn, which made it really convenient. The downsides are: the text messages could be more helpful, like telling you when your bikes were checked out instead of when they were docked, the bikes are good but not great, and sometimes you really want to ride from the financial district to the AMNH, but that's too far for the 30 minute time limit. Definitely would recommend and would reuse on future visits.\n",

      "Great system specially to move around in New York (Brooklyn even more so). I used it to take a long ride in Central Park and it was really nice, although because of the 30 min limit I'd recommend a bike rental (walk around the park and you'll see lots of guys holding 'bike rental' signs). It wasn't super stressful, but I had to keep track of time constantly so I wouldn't exceed the 30 min limit and pay extra (you pay $12 for 24h and $24 for 72 hours). After you dock it, you must wait 2 min in order to be able to pick another one up, which is reasonable, imo.I saw someone criticize that they charged her for not docking her bike properly, and I think she can't complain - I mean, it's not rocket science, you just check that a green light comes up and confirms the correct docking. Otherwise anyone can come and just take the bike away. Someone else said they couldn't find a bike in one of the docking stations. That happens everywhere in any city that has such a system. The app shows you which stations have more units available, so it's​ not really that difficult to plan ahead.\n",

      "Good intentions\n",
      "We bought a one day pass to bike around NYC, there is definitely some good intentions with this idea, but also some annoying issues like, the app not always working, preventing you from getting a bike, only 30 min ride unless you want to pay additional 4$/15 min which is a bit stressful as you always needs to plan the drop off and keep track of the clock. Errors with the bikes and the docks also caused some issues, as if you take out a bike and find out it is broken, you can place it back in the dock but are not allowed to take another bike until you have waited some minutes 3-5, even though you marked it as defect. To improve they should work on the app to solve the instability, to allow one to immediately pull a new bike if it is broken, and allow for more than 30 min ride and or lower the prize for riding outside the included 30 min.If we were to do this again, I would recommend to rent a bike another place where you have it a full day with a lock so you can bike around in your own tempo.\n",

Of course they location where we got it from did not have any space so we had to ride farther away. We docked the bike went home. We leave pretty far away like every one knows there is no citi bike up town. We got home and I got messages that I get extra charged for time. I decide to give them a call. They told me one of the bikes is not docked in. I was confused case there was one code to take the bikes and there have to be TWO messages when you dock the bike. The costumer service told me to go back and dock the bike. I have young kids and I was not able to go back. Apparently they can not do anything to help you with just have extra charges.SO PLEASE WHEN YOU EVER TAKE CITI BIKE READ ALL THE RULES EVEN THERE IS LINE OF PEOPLE WHO GETS UPSET WHEN YOH TAKE LONG TIME.

      "My husband and I just got back from a 4-day weekend in NYC. It was our first time there and other than a list of some things we wanted to see, we had absolutely no plans. As soon as we got into Manhattan, my husband spotted these bike racks and after looking into it a bit, we signed up for the 3-day pass for 2 bikes ($48+ tax). My husband is NOT a city guy, but he just keeps talking about how awesome it was having the bikes. We ended up seeing more attractions than we had ever planned partly because it was so easy to get around and partly because as we were biking, we came across places we wouldn't have even thought of! The only downfall of the entire thing was that you could only have a bike for a max of 30 minutes, which in reality makes sense, it was just a bit annoying when we wanted to ride a long distance. This was such an awesome, unexpected part of our vacation, it was invaluable!\n",

When it says $12, 24 hours and unlimited in the same sentence you expect to pay $12 for as many rides as you'd like within a 24 hour period.. I think it would be a struggle to get between some of the bike docking areas in under 30mins..We had a great time riding the Hudson and East rivers, but I only realised the issue when I just checked my credit card statement and saw an extra charge for $26.13 for a date after I'd left NY.This is really a tourist con and should be avoided..

      "I enjoyed that my friend and I were able to rent bikes for only $16, but that $16 was accompanied by several inconveniences.First, they charge a $101 hold. In order to receive the hold back, I had to call my bank twice. We rode the bikes on Saturday, and I didn't get my hold back until the next Friday. This was tough for me, as I put myself on a strict budget when I travel.Secondly, you pay $12 for unlimited 30-minute rides--NO riding for uninterrupted spans of time! If you want to bike for longer than 30 minutes, you need to find another docking bay within the 30 minute span of time, dock the bike, then request another ride. This can get tricky. My friend and I were extremely cognizant of time and still got charged $4 for returning bikes a couple minutes late.If you want a means of transportation to get from Point A to Point B, then Citi Bike will provide that; HOWEVER, if you want a leisurely bike ride around Central Park or along the Hudson, I don't recommend Citi Bike. The stress of timing myself and finding docking bays to avoid additional fees took away from what should have been an easygoing bike ride.\n",

I had trouble with the phone app. I could not see a map - which made it hard to find a station, but I could see a list of nearby stations - so with some juggling I was able to navigate. For the most part drivers were very careful and stayed out of bike lanes. Couple of double-parked cars, and taxi drop-offs, and delivery vehicles were in the lane(s).

With a one day pass we got our touring and our exercise, dropping the bikes every 30 min at a different station. The amount of stations is pretty overwhelming and is almost impossible not to find one nearby, but sometimes they might be fully occupied with no empty dock to return the bike to.so get and use the app that gives you location, availability and allows you to generate codes and unlock bikes where you need them, in addition to keeping track of time, help generating best course and identify stations.

      "This was my first experience using citi bike. I'd read up online but did not create an account or use the app. I used my credit card to rent 3 bikes - that was pretty easy. It took a minute to figure out where to put the code in, but we were good to go. Having purchased a full day of unlimited 30 minute trips, I set the timer on my phone for 20 minutes & we ventured into Central Park. After we docked our bikes for the first 30 minute session, it took a while to figure out that we needed to get new codes. when I went to get a new code, instead of getting one code good for 3 bikes, which is what I had the first time, I got a code good for one bike. back to the machine. Got a second code good for one bike. then I learned that you have to wait two minutes between getting codes. which means, at best, bike one will \"expire\" 6 minutes before bike three. what the heck is that all about? That was pretty frustrating to say the least. I still see the $303 hold on my credit card, but its only been 24 hours so I will keep an eye on it.Pros: fun way to explore an area without having to lug your own bikegreat way to get from spot to spot if you are enjoying a touristy or casual daycons: not great if you plan on a leisurely ride unless you are willing to pay $4 for every 15 minutes after the check in. While there are lots of check ins around New York city, they are not inside Central park - so we could not, for example, ride around, check in the bikes & walk right into the zoo or the skating rink. you'd have to park them out on the street somewhere and then walk back in. I would do this again if I wanted to cover a good distance without being in a car or a train. but its not cheaper than a taxi across town if you are more than one person.I would not do this again to bike in Central Park - I'd probably rent from one of the many other people there who don't require a 30 minute check in.\n",

      "I love Citi Bike. I use it several times a week in my home neighborhood in Park Slope (Brooklyn) and during the workday in Manhattan. It's ideal for short, one-way trips when you live in New York City. Tourists beware - unless you're comfortable biking in a city and/or familiar with a bikeshare program, it may not be what you expect. Citibike is NOT designed for a leisurely afternoon of sightseeing, and you're limited to using the bikes for 30 minutes at a time. You can use it to get from Chelsea Market down to the West Village. (Stop, walk around, get a bite, then get another bike (unlimited trips per day) and head to a different neighborhood.) But if you're looking to ride around in Central Park, you'd be better off renting a bike for 2 or more hours from one of the bike rental places in or around Central Park.\n",

The phone app is user friendly.The Greenway lets you cycle around the entire island, mostly along the rivers. The parts we biked were traffic free except where you had to cross streets.We also biked up and down busy avenues on specially-marked green bike lanes which often had barriers separating bikers from traffic. Other streets had bike lanes but many of these were somewhat lethal with all the double-parked cars to go around.We did the $12-a-day deal which is inexpensive with a caveat - you have to get a new bike every 30 minutes. This worked OK except for a long stretch on the Greenway along the lower East Side where we didn't see a bike station. It's an extra $4 for every 15 minutes over 30 minutes.The bikes were mostly in decent condition with 3 gears, lights in front and back and a small rack in front to carry stuff.Next time we're in NYC we plan to bike around the entire island - 30 minutes at a time.\n",

Granted I was visiting New York during pleasant weather so this might be a contributing factor to my enjoyment. Also when I visited Harlem, there were almost no citibike stands.

The baskets on the front were definitely a positive and easy to use. Unfortunately, you have to check in every 30 minutes to avoid extra charges. This is what prevented me from giving them 5 stars. This is a major inconvenience especially since Central Park is so huge!! They should have trackers in the bikes if they are concerned with them being stolen, and they should give you at least an hour or more before having to check it in between rides if you rent it for the entire 24 hour, or daily rate. You need at least an hour of cardio on a bike for it to be advantageous, and you don't want to have to worry about where the nearest check in station is, until after that hour is over.Try to fix that, and you will have more users.Thanks.EC.\n",

It was really great. We had no issue with the 30 minutes limit. There were already several station along the bike path. We just choose the stations with high inventory just in case. Keep in mind that you will need to leave the bike for 2 minutes after every 30 minutes. In our case, we needed to rest since it was a very hot day. Also, please keep in mind that it you would like to get another code, for whatever reason, you will need to wait 5 minutes for the old code to expire.Another tip, make sure that your bike is in a good shape before entering the code specially the seats.

As long as you make sure you know the location of the docking stations and use an app to check spaces and bike availability you will find it great. It is the perfect way to get around New York but try and keep to bike lanes. We cycled up to the bike route that runs all along the Hudson. It's a great day out if the weather is good.

Be sure to dock your bike correctly (when you see a green light) Otherwise you'll find yourself in a panicked Taxi ride back to its location hoping you aren't going to be charged $1200 for a lost bike. Some docks are busted.Also: using the website that shows you docking stations and bike availability is not always updated and we would get there to find it completely empty!Last small negative... they dont have baskets or bottle holders.

At more and more stations, bike docks are empty with no bikes available. A lot of stations have bikes in a bad technical conditions, which cannot be used for riding. I found 6 outbof 10 bikes having some failures, which you can only detect when trying it.\n",

      "I have used these in Washington DC so used this time in New York. You have 30 minutes included to get from one stop to the next. This can be stressful at times if you haven't clearly got your destination in mind. You must have a mobile phone to access the maps - essential! Riding in the bikes lanes in NYC was easy and there are lots of stops. Central Park was challenging as the roads for bikes are one way and there are no Citi Bikes in the northern area of the park. On the map there are stations that are coming - but I got confused and went to one and ended paying the penalty for being more than 30 minutes as it seemed to take ages to get back to the correct one.Ride along the waterfront of the river - there is lots to see and not a lot of traffic. But even riding around the streets of NYC you see so much more than you can on foot.Suggestion to Citibike: allow connecting a pay at machine to the app so that you can have an alert when the 30 min time is coming near.\n",

      "See the city by bike\n",
      "It was our second day in New York City. We decided to meet with a friend who lived near by at Central Park. He mentioned that a great way to see the park was with a bicycle. As we made it through the hectic weekend subway routing at Columbus circle. We were quickly approached by several street bike vendors offering us deals. We denied them, mostly because we weren't sure what offer entailed and usually finding bad experience with handing people off the street any money value. We had seen Citi Bike kiosk across the town and thought it would be an easy go to location with plenty of locations scattered across the city. So the whole set up for renting a bike is very easy. Read the instructions, pop in your CC and out comes a code with a receipt. Be sure to add in your cell phone number because if it wasn't for that we would have had a costly bill. So we ordered a 24 hour day pass. For 2 bikes which came to $26.00 something after taxes ( $12.00 a bike ). We had planned to visit a few locations near Central Park and eat. I rate the experience average because of their tricky guidelines that some might not see. If it wasn't for us agreeing to the text message we would have not known that we would of accrued a high bill. The fine print states that you must check in the bike every 30 mins. Which means you have 30 mins to enjoy your bike before you must physically check in your bike at another kiosk. If you don't every 15 mins you will be charge $4.00 per bike. We randomly checked our text and noticed the 30 > symbol we had been over 45 mins which means we built an additional $32.00. ( at this point we wished we had gone with the street vendors that offered us initially at Columbus circle )We quickly rushed our bikes back and checked them in at the nearest kiosk. The plus side of things is that we had a great time riding them. Some of the bells didn't work ( I think we made 4 different bike transfers) and the bikes only have 3 gears. But it was a great way to see the city and Central Park. Very convenient and easy to manage. A few things to note-$101.00 holding charge per bike- no helmets provided - use disinfectant ( handles are kinda sticky)- no bike locks -you can check the bikes in any location - they do have a basket to carry things \n",

      "Great concept; TERRIBLE in reality\n",
      "This is a great concept, but the reality of these bikes and locations is a distant cry from what we annual membership customers are actually receiving. I can't tell you how many times I have approached a bike station only to find that there are zero bikes available. Then, I search the citibike app and realize that there are no bikes available within 1.5 miles of my location. That means that I am wasting my membership. I either have to find an alternate means of transportation (walking, subway, taxi, etc.) or sit around, wasting time, waiting for someone to ride up and dock a bike. Then, I have to hope that the bike that person docks is not broken in someway (which many many of them are).Conversely, I can't tell you how many times I have been on a citi bike and have approached a docking station only to find that dock completely full of bikes… leaving me with no place to actually drop my bike off. Then, I again search the citi bike app only to find that there are no available docks within 1-2 miles. Long story short, at least 75% of the time there are no bikes when and where you need them. And when you need to drop one off, there are no available docking stations anywhere near your destination. Obviously this company is doing almost nothing to distribute the bikes properly and relocate them rapidly and efficiently. On top of all of this, the bikes themselves are terrible. The handlebar grips are ridiculously gross, and there has not been a single ride I have taken (over 100 of them at this point) where I have not had my hands covered in black, sticky rubber when I get off of the bike. The brakes almost never work very well, and the gears are even worse than the brakes.This concept is great, especially in a city like NYC. But this company is run so poorly, that I would highly recommend not wasting your money on either a single ride or an annual membership. It is not worth it.\n",

City Bikes of New York will rent you a bike for 24 hours for 12 dollars but, in the fine print, you must check in every one-half hour or you will be charged $4.00 for every 15 minutes after that until the bike is returned. Now, how many unsuspecting tourists make the mistake of renting a City Bike and find that charge on their cards. Can you imagine crossing the Brooklyn Bridge - back and forth - and checking in with the bike every one-half hour. I highly recommend renting a bicycle from a reputable rental agency - Not CitiBikes of New York.\n",

They are heavy, but probably for good reason to deter thieves; they only have 3 gears, but it's really all that's needed to get around the city for sightseeing purposes. We went all the way up to almost 60th from clear down near Wall Street. We happily pedaled past all the people stuck on West Side Highway in the traffic as we went up the bike path. We took our bikes across on 20th and it was wonderful to have the dedicated bike lane along that beautiful residential street of brownstones. It was easy to pull up the map of different bike stations. We docked our bikes for dinner and then after seeing a movie, went in search of more bikes to head back to our hotel way up on 57th street. It was cool to be able to access another set of bikes within the 24 hour period. We really enjoyed being on the bikes - and agree with other reviews about the usefulness of this transportation mode - you can really whip around the city at a clip which outdoes the subway, cab and own personal car.\n",

      "Our plan for the day was to go over to the 89th Street Community Garden on the Hudson to see a tulip festival and then hire citibike bikes and go for a bike ride along the Hudson River, around Battery Park and then a little way up the East River to Manhattan Bridge and up and over that to Brooklyn for a view back over to Manhattan and a pizza at Juliana's.....when I woke up I thought 'maybe I should just go for a walk in Central Park'...but then I thought 'go on the bike ride, it's something you haven't done..it's always been too cold on previous trips'...so I put the coffee on now and I should be OK....if it not great fun we can just go down the Hudson, dock the bikes earlier than planned and head to Central Park on foot!But....we made it...all the way...by the time we got to the bikes at 79th, I'd psyched myself into thinking we'd just ride down the Greenway on the Hudson and get to Battery Park and that would be enough. But nope, all the way....just goes to show what no prep except for walking about 15,000 steps a day for almost 3 weeks and a carb breakfast of fruit and bagel and two cups of coffee can do. Oh I did have half a very sweet protein bar at the bottom of Manhattan Bridge too...We started riding at 75th ish, loved seeing everyone out and about, including volunteers working on plantings and children playing ball and parents having a great time playing tiggy with their children (even if they did look like they were huffing and puffing a bit). We got to 41st in the first half hour, the bike docking station was full, but there was a Citibike employee there who helped enormously. So then we got to Chambers and West and swapped again. That was a fast ride too, no stopping for photos because we'd walked those two parts of length the Greenway last year in Winter and taken squillions of photos of the art and the remnants of the piers and the views, and because I have probably already taken enough photos of trees in bloom and daffodils and tulips and hyacinths. The next part of the ride was slower, gorgeous park land, I think on the river side of Brookfield Place...not quite sure; could have been Robert F Wagner Jnr Park. A few photos there. Another reason we didn't take heaps of photos is we'd been on the AIANY boat ride around the whole island the other day and I'd taken squillions of photos of the views then. When we got to Battery Park and we decided we could make it all the way, so we swapped bikes at the East side of that Park. We are going to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island on Monday, so we'll be back there then and that's when I will take more photos of trees in bloom and daffodils and tulips and hyacinths. The last bike swap was at Forsyth and Canal. Then we went up and over the Manhattan Bridge, wow - so much better than Brooklyn Bridge. The cyclists and pedestrians are on paths on two different sides of the bridge (mostly) and the path is wide and the incline not too steep. No photos, I wanted to get over without stopping just to prove I could. And I could. We parked the last of the five bikes we each hired at the river end of Parke's Camdan Plaza Park, walked around the corner past the huge line at Grimaldis, got in the short line at Juliana's and was in there 5 minutes.In all it took a little over 2 hours. (It would take much longer to ride it if you stopped for photos..if you want to do this to take photos...I would walk it. There are a gazillion photo opportunities.) The bike docking stations were easy to find...I'd mapped stations on the Greenway and elsewhere so we didn't need to ride in traffic at all. The 30 minute time limit thing without paying extra worked fine. The paths are wide, lines are marked to clearly divide the oncoming bikes from each other, and sometimes the pedestrians and the cyclists. It was a bit of a free for all around a pretty ugly area of construction near the South St Seaport, but mostly it was very easy, very attractive and great. We loved it: 10/10 to Citibikes.\n",

      "Pretty cool idea!\n",
      "We were on a 2 night family trip to NYC, trying to squeeze a bunch of fun in to a limited amount of time. The weather was nice, so we were in Central Park for a bit. My son (13) and I rented two bikes from the CitiBike stand at the top of the park. We road the entire length (mostly downhill) of the park and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, there wasn't a drop off bike rack at the bottom of the park, which is our bad for not sorting that out first. And our phones weren't working right, so we struggled with the app. BUT we were able to get the bikes into a drop off rack about 1/2 way up the park within in the 2nd half hour, so all was good. So you pay $10 for the day (24-hour period). The first 30 minutes are included. The next (and subsequent) 30 minutes cost only $4, so that's pretty affordable. If you're slick (and it's completely legal), you ride for 29 minutes and drop the bike off. Wait a minute or two, and check it back out for the next 29 minutes, which might be free. The trick, though, is knowing where the racks are (and there's an app, we just had cell phone issues). Seems like commuters use the bikes within the city, as we saw the racks at subway/transportation centers. And your $10 means you can hop on/off a bike throughout that day. We didn't take advantage of that, but $14 for an hour seemed pretty affordable for NYC. And it was perfect for the park! Bikes were adult size, so not suitable for little kids. Also no helmets. But all good. Oh with a cute bell on each bike!\n",

      "The idea of bike rental in NYC is pretty great, however, the whole docking the bike every 30 minutes is very difficult. The second you take a bike out, it feels like you need to be thinking about the next docking station. Many times, stations would be full of bikes but none were available for rental. At one point, we walked around for about 45 minutes looking for a station with bikes we could take out, which defeated the purpose of having them. The $200 hold for about a week is just ridiculous.. Not even a hotel or resort charges such a hold for so long. I dealt with it tho, because I was told about it before renting so I knew what I was getting myself into. THE WORST PART IS, that a week after we rented the bikes, and extra charge of $184 was charged to my card. Apparently, one of my bikes \"wasn't returned and someone found it the next day\", which is clearly a lie because I returned both bikes at the same time. I can't begin to describe the frustration I felt when I saw this. The customer service representative was EXTREMELY RUDE and basically said \"it is what it is, nothing can be done\". How convinient for them to say that my bike was found the next day without any proof. They can essentially say what they want and charge you whatever they can get away with. STAY AWAY! I am currently dealing with this charge directly with my bank and will never rent Citi Bike again. \n",

      "I have been a Citi Bike member since its inception. While I liked it from the beginning, I must say they have improved hugely over the last year: there are many more stations, the app is more reliable, the docking stations function better, the bikes are maintained pretty well, and the customer service is fine (the best thing: I don't need them that often anymore...). The re-balancing could be further improved, though. Also, for visitors the 30 minute ride limit is very short. Especially because they typically don't know the city that well and need a bit more time to find out where the docking stations are. Maybe introduce a \"premium\" short rental option: a bit more expensive, but with a 15 minute ride extension? Apart from this, Citi Bike is moving into the right direction. Keep on biking, a great way to move from A to B and to explore the city!\n",

      "We had a few issues with the Citi bike system consistent with what others are saying. We will not use it again.1. The 30 min check in and check out is very restrictive for tourists. Suggest Citi bike make this to 45 mins standard especially for areas like jersey city where there are not many stations, as it's difficult to get between stations in 30 mins. 2. When purchasing the hire, clearly indicate on the screen that you will hold from my bank account a $101 deposit per bike for 10 days (as we were told by customer service - it's in the fine print of the terms & conditions) very sneaky. That's my money you are holding to use as you wish. Unlawful?3.not very clear instructions on how to reset the bike after 30 mins. By chance we found by inserting the credit card each time we could continue our journey. 4. The lock system failed at one stop on one bike. We got it to work 2 mins after the 30 mins time slot expired. When tried to continue the system would only allow 2 of the 3 bikes to work. After 20 min phone call with cust service we could continue after they withdrew the overtime penalty fee. Graciously Do they want tourists to use it or local workers? That's something for their marketing team to work on. It's a great idea but needs some refining of the system if they want the tourist business.\n",

They take this out of your account as Security. Unfortunately it takes up to 10 days to be put back. This meant as I hired three bikes I lost $303 dollars from the Travel Money Bank Card we had brought. By the time I get the $303 back I'll be back in the UKAlso you can only cycle for 30 mins before you have to dock the bike (though you can't take it straight back out for another 30 minutes). This really should be 45 minutes so that you can actually get somewhere before panicking about a docking station.Finally I think I would have paid $1000 dollars for the bikes just to get rid of the hordes of bike touts hard selling their own bikes and fighting and screaming at each other. Just not cricket that sort of carry on. \n",

Citi Bike you need to change your customer info. I'm sure it's the overages that pay for the system.

I contacted Citi Bike and it seemed we did not return one of the bikes securely to the docking station and it was still classed as out on rental. Even though this was technically our fault Citi Bike kindly refunded the additional charge in full.One thing I found while having the bike on hire was trying to locate the docking stations as they seemed to be down side streets..?? So I had an idea which may or may not work.

      "this was our first time using any kind of citi bike service so a word of warning for all newbies - take care to read all the information and note the 30 minute limit! we weren't so careful and got caught out the first day but entirely our own fault so no complaints about that! The whole concept of the bikes is great and the startions are plentiful in the areas we were using them though unfortunatly in the evening time the bikes at the stations just disappeared - during the day wasnt an issue but by 5pm there was a serious lack of bikes in all of the stations around the touristy areas of times square/broadway.I would definitely recommend downloading the free app, that way you can see where there are available bikes closest to you rather than treking from one station to another.Docking and undocking the bikes should be simple and certainly inputting the machines little printout code to unlock the bike works very well, i found the locking a little more tricky, on several occasions i would dock the bike get the orange waiting light then back to red again. eventually my husband took over the docking duty and with the use of sheer brute force managed to dock bikes on first go.Getting the green light is however no guarantee that the bikes are registered back on the system, On one occasion we docked both bikes and half an hour later when we returned to get two bikes again we were refused a code because we apparently still had two bikes out. Calling the number on screen was no help either because the lady in customer services was unable to do anything to help. we were promised a call back within half an hour by her supervisor who apparently would be able to take the bikes off our account but that never came. For all intents and purposes leaving us stranded in Chelsea a few miles from home. We used another card and opened another account but now have to go though the process of fighting fees and getting a refund and having not started that yet I don't know how successful that will be! Overall i think a great service and the reason for the average rating is the shocking customer service which by any standards should be so much better. Also if you are comparing prices to london ($9.95 per 24hrs vs £2) it does look expensive.\n",

      "Last week my buddy and i purchased a 24 hour pass. It was a great experience for arround one hour. Then my friend docked his bike at the station in the Finiancial District and it was locked immovably. But when he tried to rent a new one the system claimed that the bike unlocked and unregistered. The rules says that if you do not dock your bike every 30 minute you'll get charged. And if you lose a bike or destroy it during the rental you'll have to pay 1200 dollars! Basically that seemes fair enough but it means that you're not able to move on as long as the system doesn't approve your bike as locked.So we called the customer service, and they gave us some techniques to get the bike out of the dock but it was docked rock-solid. We tried for 30 minutes while speaking with them on the phone but they could not help us. Neither us or any other customer were able to get the bike out of the dock. If so it would have been no problem to try another dock and move on. But we were stranded.In the end we had to give up but we took some pictures of the docked bike and send the evidence to Citi Bikes . We also informed them about the bike number and the dock number. In spite of that they wouldn't agree to stop our tour. They told us that we just had to wait until a mechaninc would stop by and fix the problem. But they could not tell us when. Thanks for nothing!That meant that we had to stop biking and we did not know how they would charge us. The same evening my buddy called the custumer service again. At that point they told him that the bike still was not registered as locked, but they assured him that they would not charge him for at lost bike. But.....This morning Citi Bike withdrew 1200 dollars from his account! Now we have to fight with insurance companies, banks and a foreign company (we are danes) to get his money back. All because of a miserable customer service. I'm deeply schoked and i have never encoundtered such horrible management in my whole life. I would recommend everyone to avoid Citi Bike i New York City.The biking experience is great though but choose a decent and serviceminded company. Stay away from Citi Bike.\n",

Some docking stations may be full so use the app to find the closest docking station with available spots.- There are no kickstands! Feel this is important in the event you want to stop and take pictures. My biked slipped out of my grip and landed on my leg and gave me a huge nasty bruise =o)- Make sure when you dock that the bike is locked in and the green light turns on indicating bike is locked in. I have read people being charged for faulty sensors which did not receive the bikes but I am sure that may be a rare case.I was basically charged $27.00 for maybe one and a half hours.

You need to get used to the fact that you only have 30 free minutes per ride included in the daily rent of 10 dollars, but actually that makes lots of sense. These bikes are a means for transportation. But you have so many bike stations south of Central Park (for visiting Central Park by bike you will need to hold on longer to the bikes and pay a little extra), that you can pick a new bike whereever you want. I do recommend to download the app, which tells you which stations have bikes and free bike parking available and the latter can sometimes be a problem. But if you end up a full station, the system will give you additional free 15 minutes to find an empty one. Also get yourself a map that shows the bike paths, particularly the \"green\" ones that are separate bike lanes, which are safe. The nicest and very convenient one to get from North to South is along the Hudson River. Bottom line: forget the metro, get on the bike!\n",

      "Nice Alternative to Walking for Tourists if You're On the Greenway\n",
      "After riding the Circle Line, we wanted to check out Chelsea Piers, and then get to Battery Park. It was Saturday morning, the walk was going to take an hour, and we spotted the Citi Bikes. After some debate, we picked up 3 bikes across the street from the Piers and rolled down the Greenway - a dedicated biking and running path along the harbor. The ride was lovely. The bike path is convenient, has it's own traffic controls, and runs along an area that has been BEAUTIFULLY developed. It was a great experience and offered up some incredible views of the city and the Freedom Tower. I would suggest this option to anyone visiting the city. With the following notes...- You need to be a confident rider. Even in the dedicated bike path it can be tricky.- Keep your eyes peeled at every crosswalk. Most people aren't paying an ounce of attention.- Ride the city streets at your own risk! Drivers aren't that concerned with cyclists - I almost got the cab door treatment. My only knock on Citi Bike is the location of the bike racks. They can be tricky to find, they didn't appear on Google Maps, which is the key to my survival, and the map on their website isn't very detailed and doesn't locate you via GPS.\n",

      "Citi Bike turned Very Expensive\n",
      "Citi Bike New York bike rental is a Manhattan wide burb side bike rental company that make it easy to pick up a bike on the spot. It's curbside pay machine makes you believe that if you buy a 24 hour pass that you can rent the bike for 24 hours a one flat rate. What is not crustal clear is that you must re-check the bike in to a curbside rack every 30 minutes. If you don't catch this very important information, the company will charge you a late fee every 30 minutes. My experience was for a rental on July 10th for two hours and forty-five minutes. What I understood to be a flat charge of $10 for a 24 hours rental became a $10 24 hour’s ticket fee plus a $ 53.37 charge for 30 minutes late charges. Citi Bike has a very poor business announcement of how Citi Bike rental charge for their bike rentals. Needless to say, I am highly disappointed of what I thought would be a good experience of viewing New York became a very expensive and frustrating event.I strongly recommend anyone planning of renting bikes from Citi Bike to spend a good amount of time understanding the rental terms.Also, Citi Bike must change their on screen billing information making it crystal clear of their charging terms and conditions.\n",

      "Although they have yet to expand north of 59th street, Citi bikes is an awesome way to navigate Manhattan. 24 hour rental, use bikes for up to 30 minutes for free as many times as you like, surcharges for rides over 30 minutes. You can download an app for your phone that helps tell you where the docking stations are and how many bikes are available at each and how many empty docks there are to turn your bike in. If you get to a full dock you can press a button saying it was full and they let you have more time with no charge to find an empty dock. Believe me its not hard to find the stations they are every where and along the streets and avenues that have dedicated and separated bike lanes. This beats fighting for a taxi or climbing down down down and up up up out of the subways. Love this addition to New York\n",

      "We decided to get a 24 hour pass to ride over the Brooklyn Bridge and explore Brooklyn. Bad move. The Citibike concept is great, for locals, but unless you know the area well and where the stations are it is easy to go overtime. The bridge was packed which made cycling slow and difficult. Finding the next station was also not easy, and in fact one station marked on the map could not be found at all. 30 minutes gets eaten up fairly quickly when you deduct the time to release your bike and the time at the other end to find a station.One pass went to waste as we could not get the pin to release a bike in the first instance.When I got home and checked my credit card statement I found that I had been charged a second amount which effectively tripled the cost of each pass. Needless to say this is being disputed as it far exceeds any overtime fees we may have incurred.We walked the entire way back to Manhatten because the ride over to Brooklyn was so stressful.\n",

      "Improvement needed!\n",
      "For Citi Bikes you pay 10 USD per day, or 25 for a week. You may make as many journeys of 30 minutes if you want. That is also the biggest limitation: if you go over 30 minutes, you pay extra. The advantage is that you don't need to worry if you don't want to use the bike for some time: you don't need a lock, because you can just drop it off at bikepoint.The system is now about a year old, and that means that there are still some problems. Sometimes you find a charging point completely full, or you can't manage to put the bike in. Then you need to look for another charging point. At one point we had dropped off the bikes, but afterwards we could not get another loan: the system had not registered that we had returned them. A phone call (via a gentleman in the adjoining office) has solved everything. You also need a lot of power to get the bikes out or put them back in. That is probably a vicious circle: people use a lot of power, so the system also breaks down. Sometimes lights turn red, but you can still take the bike. Sometimes there is no light, and it's impossible to take a bike. Sometimes it's impossible to borrow a bike because the machine is not working.The concept is certainly good, but still needs to be improved. At the end of the day we were a little frustrated.Back home we saw our credit card was charged more than expected: apparently we were, with one bike, 4 minutes in overtime, it costed us $4+taxes. This was due to technical problems: in the last charging point we could bring back only one bike, all the other locks were broken. We then had to go to another point, what caused the overtime.\n",

      "We saw the bikes around the city and decided to ride them from the Intrepid Museum back to our hotel (Conrad) in the financial district. We were able to pay (although it took a couple of tries) and get the bikes. We then rode to our hotel and dropped the bikes off at a station right outside our hotel. While we didn't have helmets to wear, we were able to ride on a beltway (green way? multi-use path?) that had a bike lane. So we were safe and not riding in the streets (which terrified me, and I ride a road bike in Dallas, TX on city streets). The second time we tried to rent bikes was after we got off the Staten Ferry. At this point we had a lot of issues. Codes wouldn't work, we couldn't get the machine to take our card, etc. After the 2 stations near the Ferry didn't work we walked over to one by a museum. We finally got it to work and got the bikes out. Then we went to take the beltway back to the hotel, but due to construction the path was blocked. We were unwilling to ride on the street, in the dark, so we parked the bikes and took a cab back. We tried to rent bikes again at Central Park, but my friend's code didn't work and we couldn't get the machine to take our card (yet again?!). We finally just gave up and walked around Central Park. Please keep in mind the bikes are heavy (at least 40 lbs) and you can't shift gears. While the idea of renting a bike is great, in reality it didn't really pan out so well.\n",

We also found it silly that yes you pay upfront the day fee then have to redo I your bike every 30minutes and I would of been charged more coz There was no way I could ride from Brooklyn to the nearest docking station in Manhattan in 30 minutes, this service needs to look at the day passes especially for older people who want to take there time getting around. We were then sooo rushed that we didn't get to enjoy the ride across the bridge. We do think it's a great idea if it works. \n",

      "Good idea, limited by operational issues\n",
      "Citi Bike is a company that offers short-term bike rentals (30min) at several hundred different locations throughout New York City. They can be used for transportation, or for sight-seeing.We spent over a month in New York (for work), and the first week we were in town we did a 1 week unlimited pass for Citi Bike. A rental period longer than this was not an option as you need a NYC address for them to ship the key pass to.In theory, this would have been wonderful; however in practice, the system was non-functional. We did 2-4 rides per day for that week, and there was not a single time that the system worked properly. Common issues included:-Machine at bike depot would not read credit card. This is problematic as your 1 week pass is tied to your credit card. Being unable to read your credit card means you are unable to take a bike out. You would often need to insert your card 3-5 times before it would actually read it. This was an issue essentially every time we tried to take a bike out.-The code you were given to unlock a bike would not actually be a functional code. You would receive a code, only to find out that it would not unlock any bikes. You then have to wait 2 min for the lockout period to expire, before repeating the process and getting a new code. This happened about 50% of the time, and on one occasion it took doing this 5 different times before I received a functional code.-There are frequently no (working) bikes available at depots especially during peak hours. Citi Bike says they shuttle bikes around to meet demand, and I saw them doing this; however, it is not enough, and I'd often need to walk to several stations to find a bike to take out.-The website and app information about how many available bikes there are is inaccurate. An example would be the app saying there are 6 free bikes, you walking there, and the 6 bikes all being broken and unavailable to use. This was especially annoying given that finding a bike during peak hours can mean that you are walking to multiple stations.-If using bikes at late hours when there is low demand, it is difficult to find a station that has empty spaces to return your bike. On one occasion we spent over an hour trying to find a station with open spots to drop off our bike. This was made more difficult by the fact that the app would say there were open spots at a depot; however the spots it was saying were open were actually out of service. We tried calling Citi Bike and they had no more information than was available on the app - so they would recommend going to stations that ended up having no available (not broken) spots to return the bike. We were ultimately charged time overage fees for this because we spent so long trying to find an open depot to return the bikes - Citi Bike would not refund this.I would not use it again in its current form. I understand that they are currently being audited by the city for issues with operational expenses and improper equipment maintenance and may be bought out by another company in the near future. They seem like they need many operational improvements before I would use them again.\n"

We are from out of country so we’re only using my phone due to roaming fees. You can only rent 1 bike on your app??? What??? We had to use the kiosks to rent the other one and it wasn’t easy - took us about 10 minutes to finally get another one!! Now we only had 20 minutes before having to return the bike to a station (they only give you 1/2 hour before you have to dock your bike). Because you are not able to use your bikes on the smaller paths in Central Park, we rode for 15 minutes then had to walk our bike through a path to get to another docking station. Same deal - dock our bikes, get another code through the app, and takes a while before I could get the second one from the kiosk. So we ride again for 20 minutes then look for the next docking station. We get to it only to find there are NO BIKED available at that station. Yes we could ride to the next station but the app shows no bikes there either. And of course you are incurring extra fees of $4 for every 15 minutes you are over the 30 minute. Oh and on the kiosk - I could only buy a 3 day or week pass, not a one day!!! Again - WHAT?!?? So anyway we ended up walking for the second half of the day even though we had paid for a day pass!!! NOT user friendly, 1/2 hour is NOT long enough, kiosks need to be more user friendly (at every kiosk I had people asking ME how they worked), we incurred extra fees because we could not get to the next kiosk in 30 minutes. I really felt like this was a huge money grab and we did NOT get value for the money we spent. We likely actually rode the bikes for about 45 minutes and felt like we were always having to look for the next station. I would search a bike rental place next time and rent by the hour or day!

We ended up coming out of the city and cycling up from battery park to West 46th street along the side of the Hudson. This riverside park has a brilliant cycle lane and is much quieter and safer than trying to battle the traffic in the city.The bikes are very heavy and can tire you out easily if you aren't used to cycling.They are however, good value for money, easy to use and there are lots of bike parks. 30 mins is nowhere near long enough though!! I wouldn't recommend them in Central park as the bike lanes are very limited and cycling on footpaths is not allowed, plus, by the time you get into the park and get going, it's time to start heading out to swap the bike before your 30 mins is up!\"},\n",

The Citi System is good for getting from point A to point B, but that is all I would recommend them for. The bikes have to be \"re-checked\" out every 1/2 hour and it was difficult to find a station to do this is when you don\\'t know the city you are in. Also the bikes were a bit stiff to ride with no turning radius. I guess I would recommend this to a local who needed a quick trip to work or the grocery. Not necessarily tourist friendly, IMO.'},\n",

You would either have to be diagnosed with a terminal disease and have only one day to live or have a death wish to die on 42nd and 8th ave if you decide to rent bikes in this city... my LORD!!! Everyone goes in every direction all the time, red lights mean nothing and everyone thinks honking at everyone will actually DO something. Well it doesn't.... The guy you're trying to teach a lesson to isnt getting it..... so get over yourself.We rented two bikes, and unfortunately this app will not let you rent two bikes at the same time.... so we had to use the app for one and the kiosk for the other..... so that is something they could change for sure.The bikes were in good condition, some better then others. The seats with the holes in them were less comfortable then the ones without. The basket in front had a strong bungee cord which held your stuff down pretty good.When we first got to the first station, we didn't know where to put the code..... your code will only have a 1 or 2 or 3 in it. And the key pad is on the left. The kiosk prints out a 5 digit code which after you enter it the light turns green.... HELPFUL TIP.... after it turns green, you have to lift up the bike a few inches so you can unlock it.... they don't tell you that anywhere either...... We didnt have any problems finding bike stations to pick up and drop off. The later in the day it gets however, certain stations around Time Square and Chelsea Market were clear out. I guess that's what the valet Service was for ? NOT sure....Helpful tip??? Try not to go over the 30 min time limit!!!!! IF you do, they charge $4 for EACH 15 min interval you run over. If you have to drop off and pick up right away, just wait to the two minutes to sign it out again. When docking your bike gently put the bike in and lift a few inches so it registers it and make sure the light turns green before you walk away.It's a cool way to see the city, I'm betting that I expended a LOT more calories then what they told you (that was a cool thing on the app) as my adrenalin was pretty high... I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at one point or another..... I would use this service again, it was a little less terrifying around Washington Square and in Greenwich Village, but midtown was not fun during rush hour..... yikes And good LORD buy and where a helmut!!!! \"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': 'Recently returned from NYC and used Citi bike for our group of four tourists. While the initial process seemed very reasonable and easy, in actuality we had a few issues. 1. You have to \"dock\" your bike in every 30 minutes. This seems like a lot of time until you have trouble finding a docking station with room for your bike. For each 15 minutes in excess of the 30 minutes, there is an extra $4 charge which adds up if you can\\'t find a space to dock your bike before you run out of time. You will have to ride to the next station, where the same problem may repeat. For example, our group was able to dock two bikes at one station, but there was no room for the extra two bikes so two of us rode to the next station. Then we had to walk between stations to meet up. 2. On our return trip we stopped to dock our bikes and found plenty of spaces which was good. Unfortunately, when we tried to release the bikes and continue, the card machine was not working and we could not unlock the bikes. Not to be deterred, we tried walking to the nearest Citi bike station...however, there was only one bike available there. We then walked to the next station and same problem, only two available bikes. At this point we gave up and called an Uber to take us back to our hotel. In the end, instead of an economical day of riding, we ended up with extra charges for the bikes and the cost of an Uber ride. Kind of a ripoff! On the plus side, the bikes were very comfortable to ride and in good shape. Not sure if we would use Citi bike again.'},\n",

We were also so excited when they introduced the electric peddle assist bikes, but I almost feel like it’s a bad joke. Every time you find one at a station you are left disappointed to find that it is also red lighted and not in service. I feel they need to get a better system in place to keep high demand areas better stocked and keep good, usable bikes in service.

However it was hard to figure out how to rent two bikes because the app thinks it doesn’t offer that functionality yet. At the kiosk station near one of the checkouts it said, “do you want to rent another bike?” So it seems a little dumb the brain does not know what the hand is doing. Also it would be great to have some sort of indicator on the bike of how long you’ve rented it because checking a phone while riding is obviously dangerous. We have younger children who were not with me so it would be great if there were an option for kids to ride. Understandably that’s not their market but as one of the more legitimate rentals out-of-towners would appreciate that.'},\n",

Why on earth would we rent bikes for a 24 hour period and have to come back every 30 minutes?! Then the \"ambassadors\" showed up to the desk and told us of the alternative. Shouldn\\'t one be there at all times to advise people? He said we could call the number on the kiosk to see if we could cancel that. Called, explained, denied. Terrible customer service on the call, and also there with the ambassador. By this time we had already wasted 20 of the 30 minutes so we docked the bikes and went elsewhere. Waste of $24 and our time. We just wanted to ride for an hour or two through the park, which no matter what we wouldn\\'t have been able to do with the ridiculous 30-minute time limit.

I called customer service and was told that i locked the bikes in at 32minutes. I asked to speak to an advisor so maybe she can do something on my behalf because it was really not intentional and it was my first time using those bikes and i wanted to really be positive about the experience. Also, I was maybe a minute late, but im human and its hard to hit the second mark, so it was so frusterating that i wasnt helped and after the phone call i felt so horrible the way i was treated by the supervisor. I mean, I might not have been a minute late, it just sometimes takes time until the bike gets locked into place which may have taken up these crucial few seconds to be charged extra. The woman I spoke to on the phone was pretty rude to me. I wish there would be someone i could speak to other than her to explain myself and to get a more understanding and helpful response.So overall my biking experience was great, but customer service and the supervisor was really mean to me.'},\n",

You need to plan for that and it takes getting used to but we made it work with just my wife and me. For example, to get from Midtown near Central Park to Washington Square, 30 minutes isn’t enough time if you obey traffic signals. Over 30 minutes it just keeps charging your credit card overage fees of $4 at 15 minute increments.Go figure a bank gets into bike rentals and figures out a way to charge you extra fees!!!But just like your credit and bank accounts if you keep close tabs and a nice cushion you can avoid extra fees. But sometimes crap happens even to the best of us and you get dinged. What sucks is if the place you planned to stop doesn’t have any empty docks. You can get a 15 minute extension to find another station but it is still inconvenient and it just kind of sucks. Most of the busy tourist places have a few dock stations within a few blocks but it still ruins your mojo.The other scenario that sucks is when you need to dock and there are no other bikes at that station. You don’t want to be a jerk but you also don’t want to give up the bike if you are trying to get somewhere. There is a 2 minute waiting period until you can check a bike out again, specifically so if someone is waiting they can take it. Fine if you are in a cool place but shady if it is dark out and you aren’t so sure about your surroundings. So you look at the app and try to stretch it to a station with more bikes...hope you make it on time!!!Overall, I would use it again but it might not be for everyone. '},\n",

Google map directions state it's about 19 minutes however we took our time, stopped for water and took some photos so for us it was about 45 minutes...For us to dock where we did, you will have to cross the road just above Peck Slip... which is just after you get under the Brooklyn Bridge.It's a great way to see the majority of the bridges and just have a relaxing day in New York without the hustle bustle of the busy New York streets.I would highly recommend this for anyone going to visit New York and just do something outside of the steropical tourists, which we were anyways, but found out about this so it definatey took us out of that 'sterotype' mode.The online Citi Bike map is awesome to use and the mobile phone app is awesome as well because you can see how many bikes are at a certain kiosk as well as any open docks. Very easy to rent the bikes... most if not all rental areas are stations that accept credit cards; you get a code and then enter that code on any bike dock, remove the bike and awayyyyyyy you go!!!!\"},\n",

I got a day pass for $12 USD and actually got 2 of them over the course of 48 hours because it was cheaper than buying all those single rides. Keep in mind that it's unlimited <30 min trips! All you have to do is bike for 29 mins and then put it into the dock, wait 2 mins, then take it out again! that simple! but if you don't, then you're just inviting insane charges on your credit card. I used it all day for 2 straight days and probably covered like 45 km biking around Central Park, midtown, downtown, Brooklyn and all the way up the west side highway, among many other neighbourhoods. It's so easy to use it's crazy! Also get familiar with the bikes before you set off. Some of the newer ones have an updated gear system where you just turn the crank and there's really no set gear it just progressively gets harder or easier, which I liked better than having 3 separate dedicated gears to go through. The seats were comfortable and easy to adjust if need be. No complaints. It was 100% more fun and easier and cheaper than riding the subway, but not quicker so keep that in mind. You can literally go anywhere you want with these things, there are 0 boundaries! and for that price, it is a no brainer!\"},\n",

First, they said they were offering a “free” ride from 9 am- 3 pm because it was “Earth Day” so I decided to take advantage of it. I signed up, then received an email where I had to click on the link to get my free pass. I clicked on it and did everything it asked me to, which was basically get the app and sign up. Then there was no further instructions on the email or the app. I went ahead and used my card to get the bike because I figured they would link the card/ phone number with the pass I “downloaded”. I proceeded to enjoy the day and made sure I returned the bike before the 30 minutes went up so I wouldn’t get charged and even waited 2 minutes in order to get another bike. I returned the last bike around 2:40 pm. Made sure the light turned green, as usual and that was it. Then 2 days later, I looked at my bank account and there was 2 charges from Citibike, one for $13 and another one for $48!! I called to see what those were about and was told that the $13 was the daily pass. I explained I had signed up for “Earth Day” and she says “you should have called us so we could tell you how to get the code for that.” When I said there was no instructions telling me I was supposed to call, she said there was nothing she could do because I used the bike and I was supposed to have called. I let this one slide, even though I didn’t like the fact she can see I signed up for it and the hours I had a bike and still does nothing about it AND we’re supposed to guess what to do instead of receiving an email with clear instructions to call them, but whatever... I did use the bike, so that’s fine! When I asked about the $48, the lady said it was because I did not return the bike for 2 hrs!!! I DID!!! And I waited for the light!! I told her where I returned them and I even waited for the 2 minutes to get another bike!! She said all she could do was to refund me $8!! Are you serious??? This is so sad!! I used to love riding these in the city! '},\n",

Take a few minutes prior to using CitiBike in becoming familiar with the smart phone app. This is a very powerful tool. App has a map that displays Citi bike stations. Will display in real time amount of bikes and docking spaces at each station.Used the Citi Bike app in conjunction with NYC department of transportation bike map app . NYC has made great strides in accommodating bicycle travel, and Citi Bike allows you to take advantage of this. For those uncomfortable riding in traffic there are numerous protected bike only paths that are clearly marked on NYC DOT bike map. Suggest prior to taking a ride know your destination station, Manhattan is very easy to navigate. In the event a station does not have any docking station there is an option to get an additional 15 minutes , although I never needed to use that option. If going on an extended ride you can always ride for 29 minutes dock bike.....wait 2 minutes get another code and continue riding. As a tourist didn't mind taking in the sites for a few minutes between rides. In the event you get distracted after receiving your code and you don't enter in time , get another code....that did happen to me. A tip I would like to share is that if you are going to Brooklyn use the Manhattan bridge as opposed to the Brooklyn Bridge. The Brooklyn Bridge on a nice day will be a massive wave of humanity that is difficult to ride through as many do not adhere to staying out of bike lane ! The bikes are heavy, sturdy ,and stable with adjustable seat post with markings that allow for quick setting when changing bikes. Bikes have a front rack that can hold a small day/backpack and be secured with a strap.Summary of our day pass was 6 rides for a total of 18 miles average time of ride 23 minutes. Bike helmets not supplied...bring your own !\"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': 'I have been using Citibike for 4 years in New York City for commuting, leisure, and when family/friends visit the city. It is such a great way for me to commute to work (2 miles through midtown, ~12 minutes). It is much faster, and a much nicer way to travel through the city than by car, bus, or subway. I really enjoy using Citibike to get around the city 7 days a week, and I love getting bikes with family and friends when they visit! It truely is a great way to see the city, as well as getting \"from A to B\" efficiently. I feel that any complaints I have read in these reviews are completely unwarranted, and have been made by people who have not read the agreement or understood the rules. Yearly members have 45 minutes bike rides included, while day trip users get 30 minute rides (before incurring additional fees). These rules are made very clear before purchasing anything. There is a deposit that will be held on your credit card, similar to when you rent a hotel. This is a necessary part of the program.  The Citibike app lets you know exactly where the bike stations are, and how many bikes/stations are available to help you plan your rides in advance. I have had only one or two issues in 4 years with citibike, and have been promptly helped by Citibike staff over the phone. If the 30 minute time limit does not suit your needs, I would plan on paying overage fees, or finding alternate transportation. Citibike really isn\\'t suited for long, leisurely trips. I see it a more of an efficient method for people to get around the city - while enjoying being outside and getting exercise. Hope this helps answer some questions people may have!'},\n",

New York citibikes will set you back just $12 (plus like $1.50 tax) for 24 hours of unlimited riding. All you have to do is download their app and buy a day pass. The app shows you where all the citibike stations are on a map and you can go to anyone you like a pick out a bike. You use a code on your phone to unlock the bike and off you go. There is one catch with the day passes. You need to dock the bike every 30 minutes or you will be charged $4 for every 15 minutes extra you spend on the bike. I guess this is done to curb cases of damaged and stolen bikes. It's not so bad to dock them every 30 minutes as there's so many citibike stations around New York. 24 hours of bike riding for $12 is a pretty great deal. I would recommend going to the west side of the island near the cruise terminals and grabbing a bike there. The bike path that runs along the West Side Highway is smooth and easy to navigate, plus the views are amazing. Ride down the West Side highway, through Battery Park and onto the Brooklyn Bridge. If at any point you get sick of riding you can always dock your bike and catch a subway to wherever you need to go. I would highly recommend using citibike while you're in NYC, like I said before the only downside is the 30 minute rides but it's okay as long as you keep an eye on the time.\"},\n",

The only drawback for me what's some kiosks, for some strange reason were shut down. This left me to have to go to the next kiosk in the neighborhood. The great thing is the app for the smartphone shows you where the kiosks are in your proximity and if they have a bike or a dock where I can leave the bicycle. The latest bicycle model available, allows you to adjust your speed without being limited to only the previously 3 speed increments. This allows you to take hills with ease. I bought a bike helmet at the Goodwill before I came to New York and I leave it at my friend's place for me to use. All in all I'm a very satisfied customer. I just received a $6 discount now for my next rental!\"},\n",

I wanted to visit Central Park and loved the idea of renting CitiBikes to view more of Central Park than if we were walking. The app was downloaded and we picked out our bikes after being given a code to unlock them. At first we couldn't figure out how to turn on the headlights, but then realized that the headlights and taillights turn on automatically when you start pedaling. There was an open basket up front that had an elastic band to tie things down. Yes, if you don't want to be charged more than the $12 day rate, you need to take it back to a bike station every 30 minutes. This was not an issue for us as there are stations all over the outskirts of Central Park. Fun experience that we would recommend to others. \"},\n",

I was charged $164 because the sensor on the bike rack did not register that the bike had been returned. When I contacted customer service to find out where the charge came from they told me they could only refund me $60 of the $164 charge, even though the mistake was due to a faulty sensor/locking system on their bike racks. To make matters worse I rented three bikes that day for a 24 hr period, we were only able to use the three bikes for one trip. As we tried to unlock the bikes for a second trip, it only gave us one access code for one bike, so we paid for three bikes but only received one. VERY disappointing, not just that we werent able to use the bikes the full period we paid for but that citibike was unwilling to work with me to fix their mistake.'},\n",

Plenty of docking stations to return bike every 30 minutes so as to not incur additional fees. NYC is really bike-friendly with plenty of designated lanes, just use your Citibike app to see where the lanes are. After hiking around the Park, ended up taking subway to City Hall and then grabbed Citibikes for a trip over the pedestrian-congested Brooklyn bridge...use your bell to clear the way! Then rode around picturesque Brooklyn neighborhoods that were all decked out for Halloween, along waterfront for amazing views of lower Manhattan, then into the cobblestone streets under the Brooklyn bridge. After footing around there, got a Citibike and headed back over the bridge. Highly recommend using Citibike if you’re looking for a fun, new, inexpensive way to see the city! Make sure you have the app and be diligent about watching your time and having an idea of where you want to go so you don’t incur those extra fees after 30 minutes! Happy Citibiking!'},\n",

Only a few of our trips took two segments. Whenever possible take the westside bikepath along the river. It is very fun and QUICK. Granted we had great weather but we plan to take Citibike whenever we are in NYC again. It was fun and saved us a TON of money. We were in midtown and could go downtown in about 11 minutes. People who complain here did not bother to LEARN how to use the system. Downloading the app and reading beforehand helps a lot. If you are uncertain, try for 24 hours.

We had done an organised tour in Manhattan the day before to get our cycle legs and negotiate the extra busy tricky areas. We were staying in Brooklyn and used the bikes to tour Brooklyn, down the Hudson River and to Williamsburg and Greenpoint. The bikes were very simple to use, gears changed easily and were in good condition. There were always bike docking stations within 30 minutes of each one so we had no problem finding a suitable one. Make sure that you know roughly where they are but if you stick to cycle routes there seemed to always be stations. You have to wait 2 minutes between each docking however this gives you time to have a drink and check the next location. On one occasion there were no free docking stands but a quick cycle to the next soon solved that problem. I know some people bemoan this fact but I paid £14 for 24 hours for 2 bikes, travelled miles, visited areas I would not have got the subway to and had a great day. It is nice to be able to dock your bike and leave with no responsibility for it - time for a quick coffee and then back to a new bike. The routes we used were always busy with people and bike certainly seemed to have right of way where we were. I would hire one of these every time I go!'},\n",

       "  'Entry_Quote': \"Can be GREAT....Here's LOCAL advice before you choose this option\",\n",
       "  'Entry_Content': \"I've been using Citibike since it first started and am a long time NYer. Citi Bike NYC is not for everyone. Some of it is Citi Bike's fault. Some of it is New York's fault. Below is a guide to help you decide if it's right for you.1) 30MIN LIMIT (under 1 year pass)/45MIN LIMIT (annual Pass). The Bike is really cheap, except if you hold it for more than 30 minutes. This is great if you are using Citibike as an alternative form of transport from the subway. Less great if you are hoping for a long bike ride through the city. 2) DON'T USE CITIBIKE FOR THESE ATTRACTIONS: Central park riders will think Citibike is a comparable option to bicycle renters that dot the area. In some ways it is, because the rental companies often charge $30 for 4 hours and you won't likely need the bike the full 4 hours. Central Park is a 6.1mile/10km loop provided you know where you're going. This is a 3 speed, heavy leisure bike. It's actually quite aggressive to try to get around all of Central park in 30 minutes. You can likely find a citibike, get around 2/3rds of it, find a docking kiosk depending on how you plan. A little aggressive, but possible. There aren't Citibike Kiosks yet in Central Park, so you'll be biking in and out, i.e. traffic lights. West Side Highway is a better bet, but watch the clock. Due to weight, traffic lights, and limitations of the bike, I think from 60th Street to Chinatown is the most I can do in 30minutes (about 3.5-4 miles) including undocking/redocking the bike. But I am a marathon runner, who trains regularly for competitions and I know where I'm going and where the kiosks are.3) NO HELMET vs. HELMET. NYers are notoriously bad for using no helmet. At the current moment, you will not get ticketed for failing to use one. 4) BIKE LANES & TRAFFIC RULES. Sometimes you have to ignore them if you don't plan on dying. The US Is behind European Countries for bicycling. The way cars and pedestrians behave, it's more like China, circa 1990 or the Emerging countries of Asia. You have to stay alert. That makes it wild and fun for some, but scares the pants off of others.5) THICK SKIN FOR PEOPLE YELLING AT YOU. NYers are yellers. Cabs, pedestrians, and other bikers will often all exercise their freedom of speech to strongly in their communicate their opinion of one's biking skills. You want to have a humorous attitude toward this and see it as part of the show. 6) BEST AND WORST HOURS. If you're still not deterred, realize that rush hour is the scariest time and early morning (before 7am) is the most serene time. 7) AVOID TIMES SQUARE AND HERALDS SQUARE UNLESS THAT IS YOUR DESTINATION. Even the cars avoid these areas. If you bike in these areas, your issue is pedestrians and they are extremely clueless (sorry... I love you visitors, but you guys tend to be looking up at the buildings, walking in zig zags and at odd angles across the street and it's hard to know what to do on bicycle behind you).8) DOWNLOAD 2 APPS TO HELP YOU. Citibikenyc will tell you in advance whether you're going to a kiosk station with no bikes. This will save you from getting there and burning minutes trying to find an open Kiosk. If there are only 1 or 2 slots, I would not chance it. Citymapper will tell you how long it will take an average cyclist on a heavy citibike can get there. Even if you are a competitive biker, realize pedestrians, construction, and more can get in your way. Until you get a good sense for your timing relative to Citymappers estimates in bicycling, trust Citymapper. 9) DO NOT BICYCLE ON SIDEWALKS. It's way better to bike against traffic than it is to ride on a sidewalk. Pedestrians are more dangerous than cars in this city and you are in the wrong if you hit them vs. a car which will always end up with the ticket. 10) EASIEST CITIBIKE ROUTES. If you just want to check this out and need a path that won't incur overages, get the 24 hour card. Ride along West Side Highway (WSH) doing all the attractions along the Hudson River in order. WSH is by far the safest route, as there are no cars, just pedestrians and other crazy bikers for most of it. Also, you can get a bike at Cityhall or Chinatown and go over to Brooklyn Bridge (preferably before 10am). Park your bike in Brooklyn and check out the water front. Then Ride back on the Manhattan Bridge. Each bridge is 1 very hilly mile. The Manhattan Bridge is slightly less steep and a lot less crowded. If after 10am, walk over the Brooklyn Bridge. May not be as fun to ride it.\"},\n",

In all fairness, this can be a major problem for those that do not know about it. Frankly, a tourist would likely be better off with a rental from a private rental company where they can have the terms clearly explained to them. However, if you live or work in NYC, there is no better bike option. All bikes are in good to great condition, and they do exactly what they are designed to do - give you access to a bike for a short commute within the city. Having the App is essential since it is the only way to know where the bikes are, and where you can dock them when you are done. I found customer service to be completely professional whenever I call and I have no complaints. The Citi Bike has saved me thousands of dollars in the years that I have been using it, and given me hundreds of hours of pleasure! Know the rules before you go, have the app on your smartphone and enjoy!'},\n",

Renting the bike with a credit card was straightforward. I rode up to Central park and turned the bike in, you can't keep the same bike for over 30 min w/o incurring a surcharge. After looking at the statues, i checked out another bike (no new charge, the rental is good for 24 hrs.) And had the most pleasant ride around the park. Again i checked in the bike on cental park west. After scoping out a marked path to the Hudson River greenway, i checked out another bike and headed south, a pleasant ride on a multi use pathway. I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable and functional the 3-speed bikes were. The seats are easily adjutable to approximate a fit. There are no significant hills that require a lower gear. I will certainly plan to use Citibike as an alternative transportation when returning to NY.\"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': \"We were in NYC to see a concert this week (August 10, 2017). We were near Central Park and decided to rent a Citi Bike. We made the same mistake the people in the bad reviews did, and I understand why they're unhappy. Pick the wrong rental plan and you'll be charged a small fortune. Citi offers a 'Day Pass' and an hourly pass. The Day Pass is not what it sounds like. It is meant for frequent short (30 minute or less) trips throughout the day. It's meant for locals running errands, shoppers, commuters, etc. Keep the bike for longer than 30 minutes and they charge you $4 every 15 minutes. The Day Pass is not what you want when you're on vacation, even though it sounds like it is. We made this mistake since I never read the fine print (which isn't easy on a smart phone, but...). The hourly pass charges $4 an hour, and the clock stops running when you check the bike back into a rack. When you want to ride again you pick up another bike anywhere and the meter starts running again. It's set up so you can shop, have lunch or just relax and only be charged for your actual riding time.Once we figured out that we had the wrong plan (my wife does read the fine print ;-), we went to the Citi kiosk at the south end of Central Park, where we met Tammy, a Citi Bike representative. She was awesome!! She explained the different passes, and told us why the hourly pass was what we needed. She called customer service and got our day pass refunded (minus a charge for the overtime we had run up) and got us set up with the hourly pass. She also told us a lot of great places to ride, gave us a map of the city and the Citi Bike locations, and told us about the NYC CitiStreets festival scheduled for the next day. We wound up staying overnight, renting a bike the next morning and riding down Park Ave (closed to traffic that day) and over the Brooklyn Bridge. Tammy helped me have on of my best birthdays ever- my wife and I can't say enough good things about her. She rocks, and she made us Citibike fans forever.\"},\n",

I mentioned to her that I have never used this service before and was in a rush. I asked her about the plans they offer and if I can take the bike on hourly basis. She mentioned that they only have 1 day, 3 days, monthly and annual plans. Since I needed the bike only for few hours, I went with a daily pass. The customer care representative asked me to spot a kiosk nearby to complete the transaction. What she ignored telling me is that the bike needs to be docked every 30 minutes to a bike stand to avoid a late fee. On returning the bike, I saw a humungous charge on my credit card of 100+. On calling customer care multiple times, every time I was told curtly that 'you need to plan your trip accordingly, '12$ is for system use', 'there is nothing we can do' etc. They adjusted the charge nominally on requesting a first-time courtesy but did not do it completely.This bike service is a complete scam and rip off. The customer agents are rude and this company is in business of making money based on customer's ignorance. With the amount of money they charged me, I could have bought an actual bike and used it forever! I want to question the rationale for this policy. If this is for bike sharing, the customers should be charged overtime only when the bikes there are less bikes available at the stand (similar to demand based pricing of Uber). The whole bike stand where I took the bike from was full! It pains to know that a large bank like Citi is sponsoring such an unethical company bike company! It seems both are not able to earn money by fair and regular business and adopting to such practices. Are consumer agencies listening to customer's plights and can this unfair policy be changed?Why am I being subject to something I was not aware of? Something that the customer care did not care to explain to me completely? I could have opted not to ride the bike that day. How does the charge of $ 100+ plus taxes justify using the bike for few hours in addition to paying a daily rate of $12 plus taxes and being liable for 1200$ for a lost or stolen bike? The company needs to train the customer service agents to give complete information and change the unfair overtime fees policy.I am simply not prepared and ‘cannot afford’ to pay 112$ as a bike rental for a day. I am sure others like you value your hard-earned money as well.\"},\n",

Though do be sure to dock within 30 minutes each time. But with docking stations seemingly everywhere they are easy to find, especially if you have a smartphone. The main caution is to check your bike before you pull it out of the dock. Most bikes were ok but check the tires, the bell (bell is quite important, you will use it as you are in either vehicle or pedestrian traffic all the time), the gear shift.

I'm a keen cyclist and so we looked at quick cycling options for a half day or so. I weighed up various companies inc Citi Bike which have numerous stations around the city and tourist areas. This seemed a convenient option offering freedom to pick up and deposit wherever.As I realise now it was an expensive option. Stations advertise a bike hire at $12 dollars per day. Sounds good? So I thought. The next half hour is included in the initial charge of $12 then it gets expensive. Let's face it, if your hiring a bike then 30 minutes is nothing if your stopping here and there to take on views, photos etc.Thereafter the rates jump to $4 per 15 minutes X say two bikes, it becomes a pretty expensive hire.On hindsight, I'd go for another option/company like Blazing Saddles even though it reduces hire and return options it'll work out infinitely cheaper plus provision of that all important cycle helmet.\"},\n",

It wasn't super stressful, but I had to keep track of time constantly so I wouldn't exceed the 30 min limit and pay extra (you pay $12 for 24h and $24 for 72 hours). After you dock it, you must wait 2 min in order to be able to pick another one up, which is reasonable, imo.I saw someone criticize that they charged her for not docking her bike properly, and I think she can't complain - I mean, it's not rocket science, you just check that a green light comes up and confirms the correct docking. Otherwise anyone can come and just take the bike away. Someone else said they couldn't find a bike in one of the docking stations. That happens everywhere in any city that has such a system.

Errors with the bikes and the docks also caused some issues, as if you take out a bike and find out it is broken, you can place it back in the dock but are not allowed to take another bike until you have waited some minutes 3-5, even though you marked it as defect. To improve they should work on the app to solve the instability, to allow one to immediately pull a new bike if it is broken, and allow for more than 30 min ride and or lower the prize for riding outside the included 30 min.If we were to do this again, I would recommend to rent a bike another place where you have it a full day with a lock so you can bike around in your own tempo.'},\n",

This was tough for me, as I put myself on a strict budget when I travel.Secondly, you pay $12 for unlimited 30-minute rides--NO riding for uninterrupted spans of time! If you want to bike for longer than 30 minutes, you need to find another docking bay within the 30 minute span of time, dock the bike, then request another ride. This can get tricky. My friend and I were extremely cognizant of time and still got charged $4 for returning bikes a couple minutes late.If you want a means of transportation to get from Point A to Point B, then Citi Bike will provide that; HOWEVER, if you want a leisurely bike ride around Central Park or along the Hudson, I don't recommend Citi Bike.

Got a second code good for one bike. then I learned that you have to wait two minutes between getting codes. which means, at best, bike one will \"expire\" 6 minutes before bike three. what the heck is that all about?

While there are lots of check ins around New York city, they are not inside Central park - so we could not, for example, ride around, check in the bikes & walk right into the zoo or the skating rink. you\\'d have to park them out on the street somewhere and then walk back in.

Whats more the system doesn't work, it promised 24 hours access..we go 25 minutes and then couldn't access again.After using for 25 mins we put the 2 bikes into a new rake so we didnt incur any extra charges. 2 hours later we tried to retrieve new bikes and couldn't, we kept getting the yellow light. So we gave up. The next day we saw all the charges to our card. 4 days later and lots of emails we still haven't had it fixed. Do NOT USE!\"},\n",

This is a major inconvenience especially since Central Park is so huge!! They should have trackers in the bikes if they are concerned with them being stolen, and they should give you at least an hour or more before having to check it in between rides if you rent it for the entire 24 hour, or daily rate. You need at least an hour of cardio on a bike for it to be advantageous, and you don't want to have to worry about where the nearest check in station is, until after that hour is over.Try to fix that, and you will have more users.Thanks.EC.\"},\n",

As long as you make sure you know the location of the docking stations and use an app to check spaces and bike availability you will find it great. It is the perfect way to get around New York but try and keep to bike lanes. We cycled up to the bike route that runs all along the Hudson. It's a great day out if the weather is good. You can also go across to Brooklyn and dock and pick up bikes there. Just keep an eye on the time to get the best value.\"},\n",

Used by many NY locals with annual passes.Tip- even if you are only using for a few days, you may be better off paying for monthly pass rather than the $12ea p/day.Now the negatives... Be sure to dock your bike correctly (when you see a green light) Otherwise you'll find yourself in a panicked Taxi ride back to its location hoping you aren't going to be charged $1200 for a lost bike. Some docks are busted.Also: using the website that shows you docking stations and bike availability is not always updated and we would get there to find it completely empty!Last small negative... they dont have baskets or bottle holders. Just a gap at front with a rope so have a suitable size bag or bumbag/ fanny pack you can hold your belongings in.\"},\n",

Riding in the bikes lanes in NYC was easy and there are lots of stops. Central Park was challenging as the roads for bikes are one way and there are no Citi Bikes in the northern area of the park. On the map there are stations that are coming - but I got confused and went to one and ended paying the penalty for being more than 30 minutes as it seemed to take ages to get back to the correct one.Ride along the waterfront of the river - there is lots to see and not a lot of traffic. But even riding around the streets of NYC you see so much more than you can on foot.Suggestion to Citibike: allow connecting a pay at machine to the app so that you can have an alert when the 30 min time is coming near.\"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': \"It was our second day in New York City. We decided to meet with a friend who lived near by at Central Park. He mentioned that a great way to see the park was with a bicycle. As we made it through the hectic weekend subway routing at Columbus circle. We were quickly approached by several street bike vendors offering us deals. We denied them, mostly because we weren't sure what offer entailed and usually finding bad experience with handing people off the street any money value. We had seen Citi Bike kiosk across the town and thought it would be an easy go to location with plenty of locations scattered across the city. So the whole set up for renting a bike is very easy. Read the instructions, pop in your CC and out comes a code with a receipt. Be sure to add in your cell phone number because if it wasn't for that we would have had a costly bill. So we ordered a 24 hour day pass. For 2 bikes which came to $26.00 something after taxes ( $12.00 a bike ). We had planned to visit a few locations near Central Park and eat. I rate the experience average because of their tricky guidelines that some might not see. If it wasn't for us agreeing to the text message we would have not known that we would of accrued a high bill. The fine print states that you must check in the bike every 30 mins. Which means you have 30 mins to enjoy your bike before you must physically check in your bike at another kiosk. If you don't every 15 mins you will be charge $4.00 per bike. We randomly checked our text and noticed the 30 > symbol we had been over 45 mins which means we built an additional $32.00. ( at this point we wished we had gone with the street vendors that offered us initially at Columbus circle )We quickly rushed our bikes back and checked them in at the nearest kiosk. The plus side of things is that we had a great time riding them. Some of the bells didn't work ( I think we made 4 different bike transfers) and the bikes only have 3 gears. But it was a great way to see the city and Central Park. Very convenient and easy to manage. A few things to note-$101.00 holding charge per bike- no helmets provided - use disinfectant ( handles are kinda sticky)- no bike locks -you can check the bikes in any location - they do have a basket to carry things \"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': \"This is a great concept, but the reality of these bikes and locations is a distant cry from what we annual membership customers are actually receiving. I can't tell you how many times I have approached a bike station only to find that there are zero bikes available. Then, I search the citibike app and realize that there are no bikes available within 1.5 miles of my location. That means that I am wasting my membership. I either have to find an alternate means of transportation (walking, subway, taxi, etc.) or sit around, wasting time, waiting for someone to ride up and dock a bike. Then, I have to hope that the bike that person docks is not broken in someway (which many many of them are).Conversely, I can't tell you how many times I have been on a citi bike and have approached a docking station only to find that dock completely full of bikes… leaving me with no place to actually drop my bike off. Then, I again search the citi bike app only to find that there are no available docks within 1-2 miles. Long story short, at least 75% of the time there are no bikes when and where you need them. And when you need to drop one off, there are no available docking stations anywhere near your destination. Obviously this company is doing almost nothing to distribute the bikes properly and relocate them rapidly and efficiently. On top of all of this, the bikes themselves are terrible. The handlebar grips are ridiculously gross, and there has not been a single ride I have taken (over 100 of them at this point) where I have not had my hands covered in black, sticky rubber when I get off of the bike. The brakes almost never work very well, and the gears are even worse than the brakes.This concept is great, especially in a city like NYC. But this company is run so poorly, that I would highly recommend not wasting your money on either a single ride or an annual membership. It is not worth it.\"},\n",

They are heavy, but probably for good reason to deter thieves; they only have 3 gears, but it's really all that's needed to get around the city for sightseeing purposes. We went all the way up to almost 60th from clear down near Wall Street. We happily pedaled past all the people stuck on West Side Highway in the traffic as we went up the bike path. We took our bikes across on 20th and it was wonderful to have the dedicated bike lane along that beautiful residential street of brownstones. It was easy to pull up the map of different bike stations. We docked our bikes for dinner and then after seeing a movie, went in search of more bikes to head back to our hotel way up on 57th street. It was cool to be able to access another set of bikes within the 24 hour period. We really enjoyed being on the bikes - and agree with other reviews about the usefulness of this transportation mode - you can really whip around the city at a clip which outdoes the subway, cab and own personal car.\"},\n",

But nope, all the way....just goes to show what no prep except for walking about 15,000 steps a day for almost 3 weeks and a carb breakfast of fruit and bagel and two cups of coffee can do. Oh I did have half a very sweet protein bar at the bottom of Manhattan Bridge too...We started riding at 75th ish, loved seeing everyone out and about, including volunteers working on plantings and children playing ball and parents having a great time playing tiggy with their children (even if they did look like they were huffing and puffing a bit). We got to 41st in the first half hour, the bike docking station was full, but there was a Citibike employee there who helped enormously. So then we got to Chambers and West and swapped again. That was a fast ride too, no stopping for photos because we'd walked those two parts of length the Greenway last year in Winter and taken squillions of photos of the art and the remnants of the piers and the views, and because I have probably already taken enough photos of trees in bloom and daffodils and tulips and hyacinths. The next part of the ride was slower, gorgeous park land, I think on the river side of Brookfield Place...not quite sure; could have been Robert F Wagner Jnr Park. A few photos there. Another reason we didn't take heaps of photos is we'd been on the AIANY boat ride around the whole island the other day and I'd taken squillions of photos of the views then. When we got to Battery Park and we decided we could make it all the way, so we swapped bikes at the East side of that Park. We are going to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island on Monday, so we'll be back there then and that's when I will take more photos of trees in bloom and daffodils and tulips and hyacinths. The last bike swap was at Forsyth and Canal. Then we went up and over the Manhattan Bridge, wow - so much better than Brooklyn Bridge. The cyclists and pedestrians are on paths on two different sides of the bridge (mostly) and the path is wide and the incline not too steep. No photos, I wanted to get over without stopping just to prove I could. And I could. We parked the last of the five bikes we each hired at the river end of Parke's Camdan Plaza Park, walked around the corner past the huge line at Grimaldis, got in the short line at Juliana's and was in there 5 minutes.In all it took a little over 2 hours. (It would take much longer to ride it if you stopped for photos..if you want to do this to take photos...I would walk it. There are a gazillion photo opportunities.) The bike docking stations were easy to find...I'd mapped stations on the Greenway and elsewhere so we didn't need to ride in traffic at all. The 30 minute time limit thing without paying extra worked fine. The paths are wide, lines are marked to clearly divide the oncoming bikes from each other, and sometimes the pedestrians and the cyclists. It was a bit of a free for all around a pretty ugly area of construction near the South St Seaport, but mostly it was very easy, very attractive and great. We loved it: 10/10 to Citibikes.\"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': \"We were on a 2 night family trip to NYC, trying to squeeze a bunch of fun in to a limited amount of time. The weather was nice, so we were in Central Park for a bit. My son (13) and I rented two bikes from the CitiBike stand at the top of the park. We road the entire length (mostly downhill) of the park and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, there wasn't a drop off bike rack at the bottom of the park, which is our bad for not sorting that out first. And our phones weren't working right, so we struggled with the app. BUT we were able to get the bikes into a drop off rack about 1/2 way up the park within in the 2nd half hour, so all was good. So you pay $10 for the day (24-hour period). The first 30 minutes are included. The next (and subsequent) 30 minutes cost only $4, so that's pretty affordable. If you're slick (and it's completely legal), you ride for 29 minutes and drop the bike off. Wait a minute or two, and check it back out for the next 29 minutes, which might be free. The trick, though, is knowing where the racks are (and there's an app, we just had cell phone issues). Seems like commuters use the bikes within the city, as we saw the racks at subway/transportation centers. And your $10 means you can hop on/off a bike throughout that day. We didn't take advantage of that, but $14 for an hour seemed pretty affordable for NYC. And it was perfect for the park! Bikes were adult size, so not suitable for little kids. Also no helmets. But all good. Oh with a cute bell on each bike!\"},\n",

The second you take a bike out, it feels like you need to be thinking about the next docking station. Many times, stations would be full of bikes but none were available for rental. At one point, we walked around for about 45 minutes looking for a station with bikes we could take out, which defeated the purpose of having them. The $200 hold for about a week is just ridiculous.. Not even a hotel or resort charges such a hold for so long. I dealt with it tho, because I was told about it before renting so I knew what I was getting myself into. THE WORST PART IS, that a week after we rented the bikes, and extra charge of $184 was charged to my card. Apparently, one of my bikes \"wasn\\'t returned and someone found it the next day\", which is clearly a lie because I returned both bikes at the same time. I can\\'t begin to describe the frustration I felt when I saw this. The customer service representative was EXTREMELY RUDE and basically said \"it is what it is, nothing can be done\". How convinient for them to say that my bike was found the next day without any proof. They can essentially say what they want and charge you whatever they can get away with. STAY AWAY!

The whole concept of the bikes is great and the startions are plentiful in the areas we were using them though unfortunatly in the evening time the bikes at the stations just disappeared - during the day wasnt an issue but by 5pm there was a serious lack of bikes in all of the stations around the touristy areas of times square/broadway.I would definitely recommend downloading the free app, that way you can see where there are available bikes closest to you rather than treking from one station to another.Docking and undocking the bikes should be simple and certainly inputting the machines little printout code to unlock the bike works very well, i found the locking a little more tricky, on several occasions i would dock the bike get the orange waiting light then back to red again. eventually my husband took over the docking duty and with the use of sheer brute force managed to dock bikes on first go.Getting the green light is however no guarantee that the bikes are registered back on the system, On one occasion we docked both bikes and half an hour later when we returned to get two bikes again we were refused a code because we apparently still had two bikes out. Calling the number on screen was no help either because the lady in customer services was unable to do anything to help. we were promised a call back within half an hour by her supervisor who apparently would be able to take the bikes off our account but that never came. For all intents and purposes leaving us stranded in Chelsea a few miles from home. We used another card and opened another account but now have to go though the process of fighting fees and getting a refund and having not started that yet I don't know how successful that will be! Overall i think a great service and the reason for the average rating is the shocking customer service which by any standards should be so much better. Also if you are comparing prices to london ($9.95 per 24hrs vs £2) it does look expensive.\"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': \"Last week my buddy and i purchased a 24 hour pass. It was a great experience for arround one hour. Then my friend docked his bike at the station in the Finiancial District and it was locked immovably. But when he tried to rent a new one the system claimed that the bike unlocked and unregistered. The rules says that if you do not dock your bike every 30 minute you'll get charged. And if you lose a bike or destroy it during the rental you'll have to pay 1200 dollars! Basically that seemes fair enough but it means that you're not able to move on as long as the system doesn't approve your bike as locked.So we called the customer service, and they gave us some techniques to get the bike out of the dock but it was docked rock-solid. We tried for 30 minutes while speaking with them on the phone but they could not help us. Neither us or any other customer were able to get the bike out of the dock. If so it would have been no problem to try another dock and move on. But we were stranded.In the end we had to give up but we took some pictures of the docked bike and send the evidence to Citi Bikes . We also informed them about the bike number and the dock number. In spite of that they wouldn't agree to stop our tour. They told us that we just had to wait until a mechaninc would stop by and fix the problem. But they could not tell us when. Thanks for nothing!That meant that we had to stop biking and we did not know how they would charge us. The same evening my buddy called the custumer service again. At that point they told him that the bike still was not registered as locked, but they assured him that they would not charge him for at lost bike. But.....This morning Citi Bike withdrew 1200 dollars from his account! Now we have to fight with insurance companies, banks and a foreign company (we are danes) to get his money back. All because of a miserable customer service. I'm deeply schoked and i have never encoundtered such horrible management in my whole life. I would recommend everyone to avoid Citi Bike i New York City.The biking experience is great though but choose a decent and serviceminded company. Stay away from Citi Bike.\"},\n",

Some docking stations may be full so use the app to find the closest docking station with available spots.- There are no kickstands! Feel this is important in the event you want to stop and take pictures. My biked slipped out of my grip and landed on my leg and gave me a huge nasty bruise =o)- Make sure when you dock that the bike is locked in and the green light turns on indicating bike is locked in. I have read people being charged for faulty sensors which did not receive the bikes but I am sure that may be a rare case.I was basically charged $27.00 for maybe one and a half hours.

You need to get used to the fact that you only have 30 free minutes per ride included in the daily rent of 10 dollars, but actually that makes lots of sense. These bikes are a means for transportation. But you have so many bike stations south of Central Park (for visiting Central Park by bike you will need to hold on longer to the bikes and pay a little extra), that you can pick a new bike whereever you want. I do recommend to download the app, which tells you which stations have bikes and free bike parking available and the latter can sometimes be a problem. But if you end up a full station, the system will give you additional free 15 minutes to find an empty one. Also get yourself a map that shows the bike paths, particularly the \"green\" ones that are separate bike lanes, which are safe. The nicest and very convenient one to get from North to South is along the Hudson River. Bottom line: forget the metro, get on the bike!'},\n",

It was Saturday morning, the walk was going to take an hour, and we spotted the Citi Bikes. After some debate, we picked up 3 bikes across the street from the Piers and rolled down the Greenway - a dedicated biking and running path along the harbor. The ride was lovely. The bike path is convenient, has it's own traffic controls, and runs along an area that has been BEAUTIFULLY developed. It was a great experience and offered up some incredible views of the city and the Freedom Tower. I would suggest this option to anyone visiting the city. With the following notes...- You need to be a confident rider. Even in the dedicated bike path it can be tricky.- Keep your eyes peeled at every crosswalk. Most people aren't paying an ounce of attention.- Ride the city streets at your own risk! Drivers aren't that concerned with cyclists - I almost got the cab door treatment. My only knock on Citi Bike is the location of the bike racks. They can be tricky to find, they didn't appear on Google Maps, which is the key to my survival, and the map on their website isn't very detailed and doesn't locate you via GPS.\"},\n",

That is also the biggest limitation: if you go over 30 minutes, you pay extra. The advantage is that you don't need to worry if you don't want to use the bike for some time: you don't need a lock, because you can just drop it off at bikepoint.The system is now about a year old, and that means that there are still some problems. Sometimes you find a charging point completely full, or you can't manage to put the bike in. Then you need to look for another charging point. At one point we had dropped off the bikes, but afterwards we could not get another loan: the system had not registered that we had returned them. A phone call (via a gentleman in the adjoining office) has solved everything. You also need a lot of power to get the bikes out or put them back in. That is probably a vicious circle: people use a lot of power, so the system also breaks down. Sometimes lights turn red, but you can still take the bike. Sometimes there is no light, and it's impossible to take a bike. Sometimes it's impossible to borrow a bike because the machine is not working.The concept is certainly good, but still needs to be improved. At the end of the day we were a little frustrated.Back home we saw our credit card was charged more than expected: apparently we were, with one bike, 4 minutes in overtime, it costed us $4+taxes. This was due to technical problems: in the last charging point we could bring back only one bike, all the other locks were broken.

While we didn't have helmets to wear, we were able to ride on a beltway (green way? multi-use path?) that had a bike lane. So we were safe and not riding in the streets (which terrified me, and I ride a road bike in Dallas, TX on city streets). The second time we tried to rent bikes was after we got off the Staten Ferry. At this point we had a lot of issues. Codes wouldn't work, we couldn't get the machine to take our card, etc. After the 2 stations near the Ferry didn't work we walked over to one by a museum. We finally got it to work and got the bikes out. Then we went to take the beltway back to the hotel, but due to construction the path was blocked. We were unwilling to ride on the street, in the dark, so we parked the bikes and took a cab back. We tried to rent bikes again at Central Park, but my friend's code didn't work and we couldn't get the machine to take our card (yet again?!). We finally just gave up and walked around Central Park. Please keep in mind the bikes are heavy (at least 40 lbs) and you can't shift gears. While the idea of renting a bike is great, in reality it didn't really pan out so well.\"},\n",

We also found it silly that yes you pay upfront the day fee then have to redo I your bike every 30minutes and I would of been charged more coz There was no way I could ride from Brooklyn to the nearest docking station in Manhattan in 30 minutes, this service needs to look at the day passes especially for older people who want to take there time getting around. We were then sooo rushed that we didn't get to enjoy the ride across the bridge. We do think it's a great idea if it works. \"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': \"Citi Bike is a company that offers short-term bike rentals (30min) at several hundred different locations throughout New York City. They can be used for transportation, or for sight-seeing.We spent over a month in New York (for work), and the first week we were in town we did a 1 week unlimited pass for Citi Bike. A rental period longer than this was not an option as you need a NYC address for them to ship the key pass to.In theory, this would have been wonderful; however in practice, the system was non-functional. We did 2-4 rides per day for that week, and there was not a single time that the system worked properly. Common issues included:-Machine at bike depot would not read credit card. This is problematic as your 1 week pass is tied to your credit card. Being unable to read your credit card means you are unable to take a bike out. You would often need to insert your card 3-5 times before it would actually read it. This was an issue essentially every time we tried to take a bike out.-The code you were given to unlock a bike would not actually be a functional code. You would receive a code, only to find out that it would not unlock any bikes. You then have to wait 2 min for the lockout period to expire, before repeating the process and getting a new code. This happened about 50% of the time, and on one occasion it took doing this 5 different times before I received a functional code.-There are frequently no (working) bikes available at depots especially during peak hours. Citi Bike says they shuttle bikes around to meet demand, and I saw them doing this; however, it is not enough, and I'd often need to walk to several stations to find a bike to take out.-The website and app information about how many available bikes there are is inaccurate. An example would be the app saying there are 6 free bikes, you walking there, and the 6 bikes all being broken and unavailable to use. This was especially annoying given that finding a bike during peak hours can mean that you are walking to multiple stations.-If using bikes at late hours when there is low demand, it is difficult to find a station that has empty spaces to return your bike. On one occasion we spent over an hour trying to find a station with open spots to drop off our bike. This was made more difficult by the fact that the app would say there were open spots at a depot; however the spots it was saying were open were actually out of service. We tried calling Citi Bike and they had no more information than was available on the app - so they would recommend going to stations that ended up having no available (not broken) spots to return the bike. We were ultimately charged time overage fees for this because we spent so long trying to find an open depot to return the bikes - Citi Bike would not refund this.I would not use it again in its current form. I understand that they are currently being audited by the city for issues with operational expenses and improper equipment maintenance and may be bought out by another company in the near future. They seem like they need many operational improvements before I would use them again.\"}]"

      "I live in the DC area and we've used the service a couple of times. It's such a great way to show friends the city. We used them most recently a couple of weeks ago for about two hours. We went to dock the bikes (there are guidelines for this, you watch videos, etc. to learn how) and began receiving texts that the bike wasn't docked. We returned to the docking station to make sure it was docked and did all their \"checks\" -- the bikes were docked. We called Capital Bikeshare three times and emailed twice that night, trying to solve the problem, but got no response. The next day we FINALLY got in touch with them and they immediately told us we'd be subject to a $1,200 stolen bike fee (?!). I explained the situation, that we had checked the bikes and tried to resolve the issue, and they said someone had JUST found the bike (?!) so they would make the feee $60 instead. I continued to ask questions and before long, when it was clear they weren't interested in what I was saying, I asked for a customer service number and the name of the representative. She said she didn't have to give me any information and hung up on me. I then contacted Lyft, the company who owns Capital Bikeshare, and was totally ignored for two weeks after multiple customer service tickets. (Keep in mind, they require your credit card info before you ride so they can charge you for anything they want afterward.) Ultimately, these bikes are a fun and cool idea. But know that if you ride them you're opening yourself up to $1,200 in fees if ANYTHING goes wrong (even if their technology fails!) with absolutely no customer service. I am not willing to take that risk, and unfortunately will not be using these bikes again.\n",

      "Worst mistake of renting a bike. We were exhausted from walking and in a sketchy part of town at night, trying to quickly access a bike and didn’t realize what we agreed to. We rode to the Lincoln memorial, parked, walked 5 steps away and took a picture and someone rode off on our bikes. On the scooters (that we used all day but we’re dead at this time) they had GPS’s and you can end your ride immediately if someone takes off on it. We didn’t realize the bikes weren’t like that (first time using it) and were devastated when they were gone, and read the “you’re responsible for up to $1200 if bike is not returned” part. Called customer service immediately and the nice lady reassured me if whoever stole them returned them, she would waive the fee. Well, the man I talked to today said he would not be able to do that and was super rude and said “well I could get my manager to review it but we don’t normally waive fees.. but like at least they returned the bike”... yes we’re SUPER grateful they returned the bikes... but it was 14hrs later (have to turn them in every 30min for no overage charges) so we were charged $94 each for a BIKE that we rode for maybe 20 minutes because we “abandoned it”... at the time I was frustrated because he was making it seem like I was lying to him about the lady saying she would waive the fee, so I said forget it because he was SO rude. It was a good 20 minutes while it lasted but if you’re in DC don’t you dare get off that bike at ALL for anything at all or you’ll be charged out the butt for a bike that isn’t even worth that much money. Rent a scooter, it’s cheaper in the long run and has a GPS. The lady in customer service was awesome, but the man who I spoke to today should not be in customer service at all. Such a shame because we enjoyed the bikes but we will not touch one again due to this awful experience. Find a different bike service. Get a scooter. Anything other than being possibly responsible for a $1200 charge for a freakin bicycle.\n",

We called the company who is of no help. They tell you to call DC police (yep, they’re super concerned over a stolen bike). Bottom line, my credit card was just charged $1200 for a maybe $200 bike.

Confirmed all bikes were locked (could not be moved) and left to tour monuments. Came back 1 hour later and could only take 3 bikes because it said 1 was still out. That serial number was no longer there. We called company. They said it happens all the time and whoever took bike next would be docking it within 30 minutes. It is 24 hours later and the bike is not returned. Now they are telling us to file a police report. Police say it needed to be filed when bike was noticed it was missing and we are no longer in DC. Police also said they get tons of reports that this happens all the time. We are now being held responsible. Look at the screnshot of my texts.

      "This service is an asset, not unlike the Citi bikes you will find in NYC. You will find docks of bikes throughout Washington and with a little patience you will be on one or two of these bikes to explore the city. My only grief was trying to get up and running as that process is far from intuitive. After downloading the app, selecting your bike, I confess it was not clear at first where one enters the code generated by the app to release the bike. Once we got that ironed out, we remained mindful that we only had 30 minutes to get them back to one of the docks, which we did but there was more confusion on our part on how to successfully lock them back up. Thankfully, I had a 13 year old in my company who diagnosed that problem but again, none of this is intuitive. The key is sorting all of that out in advance AND knowing how long you need the bike for. If 30 minutes puts too much pressure on you, I would opt for the longer periods as the increase in rental rate is not that cost prohibitive - it sounds like it is costly otherwise if you poorly estimate how much time you need.\n",

It is extremely sneaky and no one who is going around to see the sites are going to focus on how long they have had the bike out. It is absolutely heartbreaking that a trip of a few hours cost me $38 because I was unaware of their late charge policy. Capital Bikeshare, if you are reading this, please please please change your business model. This is seriously awful. I can either keep the bike for the time period I need or I will have to dock the bike after 30 minutes and rent it again. Your competitors in DC (JUMP specifically) are way ahead of you.

If you do not dock or switch bikes every 30 minutes you will be charged a late fee.I will say there numerous stations to make this possible but to need to set a timer to switch bikes to avoid a late fee makes this not worth it.\n",

We rented at the Jefferson Memorial, road to Lincoln, walked to DAR, road back to Jefferson. The only hiccup was at the Vietnam Vets Memorial the bikes were all gone so we had to walk another block to pick up more (not an issue) and then when we wanted to return them the rack was full back at the Jefferson Memorial. Keep that in mind and think about alternative drop/pickup points an all is good. Bikes were easy to use, a bit heavy but that is to be expected and made for a great time.\n",

The only downside to docked bikes in cities is that you have to dock every 30 minutes or you get charged extra so that adds a little anxiety to the ride but other than that the price is right and saves a lot of steps. It is also great after a large dinner to burn off some calories. We bought the 24 hour pass and road quite a bit but one of the nicest rides was around the tidal basin. They have the basket type area in front but what would also be nice is a bike lock and the option to grab a helmet somewhere. Definitely recommend and have fun!!!\n",

      "My nephew and I rented two bikes right on the mall. They were absolutely the highlight of the trip. I LOVED how much fun it was. I came here to leave a review and was shocked at how awful some of the reviews are. I had such a positive experience.The first place we stopped to rent bikes had a line, and only a few bikes, so we kept walking. About a half mile later, we found another rental spot with lots of bikes and nobody waiting.I did find the cost explanation posted to be very confusing. It was also not easy to read the tiny screen in the bright sun. But in the end, we got it figured out, and rented two bikes. My credit card was immediately charged $4 for two bikes for the first half hour. Let me tell you, the mall is huge. So riding down the sidewalk to the Lincoln Memorial was the best way to travel. We saved so much time! And it was so much fun! I haven't been on a bike for 15 years, and it's true what they say. You never forget how to ride a bike.The only drawback was the fact that there were so many people everywhere. It was hard to ride in that area, because of course, pedestrians have the right of way. The bikes had little bells to warn people you were passing, but most people really weren't paying attention to that. We kept our bikes a bit over the 30 minute limit, and when we docked them near the White House (I found docking locations on google maps) we were charged an additional $4 for the next half hour. Still, $8 for two bikes for 45 minutes was well worth it!I did have a little trouble docking my bike. I kept slamming it into the docking station, but never got the green light. My nephew had a softer touch, and he pushed it just a little bit tighter, and got the green. I liked having that reassurance that the bike was officially returned. I also liked that the docking station had a place to indicate if the bike had any problems associated with it, so it would be checked before being rented out again. I would absolutely get one of these bikes again, but perhaps during a less crowded time of year. I would also recommend the powers-that-be try to simplify the cost structure. It was too confusing.\n",

The code the kiosk gives you is only valid for 5 minutes for the $2 ride, so needless to say I wasn't able to unlock a bike before it expired. Thankfully it was only $2 I wasted! The kiosks do not tell you that a red light on a bike's dock means it cannot be checked out. I went to another station and 3 broken bikes were there but no working ones. Made it to station #3 and grabbed the one working bike of the 5 docked. On the way to finally getting a bike out I saw a few people also pay for bikes they couldn't use and there's no way to refund your money.Once I had a bike though it was pretty nice.

I had downloaded the app and understood that we needed to dock the bikes within the 30 minute time frame and with the map on the app it was easy to plan where to begin our ride so we could end up back at our car later. The entire trip was about 3 hours and we would have kept going except it began raining. Once in the car I got the texts the company sends saying the bikes are docked but I didn't realize until we were back at our hotel in bed that only 3 of the 4 bikes had docked. I called the company and the suggestion I go back to the docking station at 2 am to redock it was laughable. I explained that was impossible since it was the middle of the night, kids are asleep and it's raining out and I knew the darn thing locked in since we tried pulling them out when we docked to make sure they were locked in. They sent someone the next morning and I got a text at 6am the bike docked. I then called them and they took the charge off my Credit Card. Good customer service but having worked for attorneys I knew worse case scenario I could and would dispute the charge and force them to waste the money taking me to court of need be. But only because I knew the bikes locked in with no doubt. Overall go for it.....rent the bikes. Have a blast and make sure you get a green light when docking even if it's pouring down rain.\n",

As others have already said: be sure you understand the pricing structure. Other bikes in the area such as LimeBike can be a bit more convenient (the LimeBike I used came with a phone mount for using maps!) but they aren’t necessarily together in one place, so harder for a family or group to find and use. Also, beware if you’re on a schedule: if a docking station is full, they’ll give you an extra 15 minutes to take the bike to another docking station, so long as you request it from the full docking station. Not a big deal for a tourist but if you’re on a time schedule that could be a big hassle.

We downloaded the app to our phone and there was always a bike stand within a few minutes walk near where we wanted one. My suggestion is to only drive to one monument or place at a time.

We even rode from the Jefferson Memorial to the statue of Iwo Jima. it was really windy and we almost didn't make it there in the 30 minutes so would have been charged extra. We used them a lot the weekend of the March 4 our Lives event because there were so many people around. The bikes were great for us. Just make sure you understand how to use and rent them before coming. They aren't great for younger children. I would use a service like Bike and Roll to make sure to get them a proper fitting bike, helmet, and lock.\n",

      "This was a perfect idea for the summer. There are many bike stands in Washington. You can rent for a day or per hour. You won’t have many bikes available at monuments (lincoln memorial for example was a problem). We arrived there and put the bikes there but when we wanted to continue, none were available at that time. The APP lets you know how many bikes are available at what location. The only things that bothered me as a tourist there: what are the road rules for the bikes (they should add this at every location. Every country has its own rules. Can you ride your bike on sidewalks or in the parks etc.?). No helmets available. And when you get a day pass, you have to enter your credit card every time with your pin. So it wasn’t clear if they were charging me correctly. Other than that, great way to get around.\n",

      "Renting a bike in DC is a wonderful way to explore the city in ways you probably hadn’t done before; especially on traffic-free days like a Sunday or a Holiday. We rented the Capital Bikeshare service nearby the Fed Reserve and returned it Georgetown. The bikes are in excellent shape and the rental procedure is straight forward; note that the service is designed for point A to point B transportation, not for daily continuous use, as there is a 30 minute limit per use. If bike is not exchanged within the 30 minutes, additional charges apply. It’s important to consider the above in comparing with other bike services; also mind that in heavy rental times you’ll have to search through various return sites. When we rented, most returning sites were full: the app facilitates this. Overall, the experience was good, but the somewhat sneaky fee & subscription service left a bad aftertaste, even though they refunded the excess charges. \n",

Easy enough though, just set a timer for 25 minutes and when it goes off, just find a docking station, dock your bike and start the process all over again. The only real downsides are that the docking ports aren’t always where you might want them to be and bikes are not always available. So using the app is of prime importance. Also check out Mobike, another great service where you just ride it somewhere and leave it. Bring your own helmet for none of these services provide them\n",

It is difficult to ride with so may pedestrians. I found myself getting off of my bike to avoid hitting people or while waiting to go across crosswalks. In addition to that, you have to navigate broken pavement and other obstacles.

      "I wish that I had read these reviews before renting the bikes as it would have clarified things. We saw people riding the bikes in town and thought it would be a great way to get around. We did enjoy our experience, but not the fees. They are intentionally unclear. Due to this ambiguity, we misunderstood the daily membership concept from the kiosks and therefore were charged $88 for using two bikes two times (roughly 2.5 hours and 1.5 hours) After calling to inquire about the fees, we now understand that it is $8 for as many trips up to 30 minute over the 24-hour period. Keeping it past 30 minutes costs additional fees, and these fees grow expedentially. The inquiry call did result in some money being credited back. The bike themselves were comfortable and had 3 speeds. We were were visiting the monuments and didn't find the station near the Jefferson memorial. (We were going off our memory from the kiosk by the Washington monument; perhaps the app would have helped.). When we got to Lincoln there were only 2 bikes in the kiosks and we consciously didn't turn in our bikes because we were afraid none would be there when we were ready to leave. If we had understood the concept, we could have checked them back in and then immediately checked them back out.I believe the cost structure is intentionally deceptive and therefore only give them 1 star. However, riding was fun and the metro involves a lot of walking to see all the monuments, so I hope they become more transparent and honest and that they offer a true daily rate.\n",

      "i think capital bike share is a great opportunity where for only few bucks you can use the service all over the city.2 drawbacks1- you need to be careful to return your bike within 30 minutes or else you will be charged alot ! ( you can take another bike from the dropoff dock)2- You need to be careful that the destination station has empty docks, else you will need to ride to another place which might be far from destination and in the process exceed 30 minutes. My recommendation :1- install the app, and always make sure that at least 2 empty docks are free at the desired destination 2- plan 24minute trips, so whatever goes on your way, you will not exceed the 30 min threshold.finally i think this is a convenient way to commute since there are docks/ bikes all over the Washington DC and Virginia., and you do not need to worry to park your precious bike on roads, carry it on buses and metros. or leaving it in unsafe places.Hope this was beneficial\n",

Had to call Bikeshare office because the screens at the stations are small, and scratched up , very difficult to read. But Bikeshare gave me a code to switch to another bike. After having a wonderful time touring DC we ended our day on the river in Georgetown area and put the bikes into a station there. Had a great day. But days later when we got our charges for the bike rental which was to be $8 for a day rental, my charge was $38 and they were charged $40. I called the Bikesare billing office and was told that I needed to return the bike to a station every 30 minutes in order to be charged $8 for the day. This was not clear to us when we rented the bikes. The web page is very deceiving about touring for a day. I was told bu the office that these bikes are for commuters not touring. I think this was a very deceitful business practice meant to gouge tourist. I will not use the bike service again and do not recommend it.\n",

      "I'm surprised with all of the bad reviews on here, the bike share is really not that hard if you follow directions. You sign up at a station using a credit card. You will use same credit card throughout the day to receive a code to unlock your bikes. The most you can link to one card will be two bikes. So if you have a family of 4, you will need two cards. Not a big deal, but can be inconvenient. We did the 24 hour pass for 8 bucks each. Basically, you unlock your bike and you have 30 min to drop off at another bike station. You can literally just drop it off, swipe for another code and check it back out. I don't see why you would wanna keep it out for more since you stop at a museum or memorial and walk around, who would wanna walk around with their bike? The stations are located all over the memorials and cities. I downloaded the app and could click on a station to see if there was docking available and or bikes, and this also gives you a way to plan out your day to see everything. The app is updated in real time. If you happen to get to a station with no docks available, you can request a grace period to find another station. Also when you check your bike in, just make sure the light turns green to know you checked it in correctly. They will also send you a text message. I absolutely loved it, there's no way we would have been able to see all the sights at the mall without this. We didnt miss our 30 min deadline once, so all day it was just $16 for both of us! If i had to do it again, I would have chose to go on a weekday for less crowds, easier to ride. \n",

If you need more than 2 bikes, have another credit card on you.This was a great way to move from the top of the mall to the bottom quickly.The problem came when we returned the bikes. All 3 bikes received a green light to indicate the bike was properly docked. I also received (2) texts. Here is where I messed up. I though that meant the (2) RECEIPTS were successful. However, it actually was each bike, meaning (1) of the bikes was not successfully docked even thought we got a green light. About 30 minutes later I received a text that we were being charged additional fees for being over the 30 minutes. I called and spoke with a gentleman who asked if we were near the bikes. We were not. He said he would send someone to dock the bike. He was very pleasant. This put a damper on our time as we knew \"I Agree\" to the $1200.00 cost of the bike if anything were to happen to it. It was quite the bummer on our trip. About 45 minutes later we received a text that the bike was successfully docked. OMG was I so relieved. The cost of the bikes should have been $6.00 for 3 bikes, but I was charged $2.00 on the one credit card and $4.00 TWICE on the other credit card. Seems others have been overcharged much more so I did not call to dispute the charge. Although it does seem like they make their money by overcharges.The charges do seem confusing on the website and from other reviewers as you can take the bikes out for longer time periods, but it is a small extra charge per 1/2 hour. (makes sense) I just dont see how it adds up to such a large bill as other posters mention. I would do this again, but I would be very cautious in making sure everything has been returned properly and make sure of the charges to my credit card.\n",

      "I rented two bikes for my daughter and myself at Wilson and 31st in Arlington on July 21. We literally had the bikes for 10 minutes -- just enough time to ride to the bottom of the hill and dock them at Arlington Mill Road -- less than a mile away. This was only my second time renting from Capital Bikeshare and I didn't re-dock the bikes properly. I happened to check my bank account on July 22 about midday and noticed a charge of $62 in addition to the $4.00 rental charge from Capital Bikeshare. I called and spoke with two different representatives who explained that one bike was returned five hours later to a station on Four Mile Run and the other had not yet been returned and was still accusing charges. Maurice said they could authorize a one-time courtesy reimbursement of half of the charges -- which could not be finalized until the other bike was returned. I drove down two the Arlington Mill station and located the bike that was parked but not properly docked. I locked it into place and called back to speak with a supervisor. After calling back several hours later, I was told a supervisor would contact me at 11 pm. Irene did call me but said exactly the same. It was my fault for not docking the bike properly, the instructions are clearly printed on the kiosk, and she could only authorize half of the charges refunded. I said I found that outrageous as an annual pass costs less that my total charges -- which amounted to $157.00. I could have purchased a day pass, a three-day pass, or an annual pass for less. I asked to speak with someone above her and was told there was no one. I called back later and asked another representative, Cynthia, for the name of Irene's supervisor. She said Ashley and Irene are the only two supervisors; there is no one above them. I find it extraordinary that a business can blindly rob people, legally. Capital Bike Share is BANKING on novice users to make a docking mistake so they can profit. If they cared about the customer, they would notify customers via text when their time is near expiring -- that would be GOOD business. I never received any notification that the bikes had not been docked properly -- even though that is a question addressed on their FAQ page. If I hadn't checked my back account, that bike would still be accruing charges. I am just asking for a little kindness and compassion. I understand that I made an unfortunate mistake, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Give me an annual pass OR reduce the rate to $25, and IMPLEMENT A NOTIFICATION SYSTEM to customers! I will make sure every online reviewer hears this story and I will never rent from a this company again -- absolutely no humanity!\n",

Impossible in most cases. the sign should clearly spell out the cost of using these bikes. they should not be used by anybody who wants to bike for more than 30 minutes in total. They apply creative billing once you are done and the line-by-line charges are not predictable at all based on what is posted at the racks. If you are sight-seeing, find a different way to get around. It would have been cheaper to bring our own bikes with us on the plane!\n",

      "Awesome Ride Awful Upcharge due to Unclear Procedure\n",
      "My friends and I loved riding these bikes around DC. We were in from out of town and enjoyed getting the exercise and the adventure of finding the bikes at the different docks and heading down from Adams Morgan to the mall. We happily and smugly rode around the enormous mall and covered so much more territory than we ever could have on foot. We stopped and ate at a fun restaurant, parked (not docked) our bikes and fully enjoyed our day... until ...the next day my friend checked her credit card and we got the sticker shock. Two bikes -- $108 for 4 hours of riding! And we signed up for $8 (x2=$16) for 24 hours. What the heck? WE HAD NO IDEA THAT WE HAD TO DOCK THE BIKES EVERY 30 MINUTES AND TAKE THEM OUT AGAIN IN ORDER TO KEEP THE CHARGE AT $8. Had we read Tripadvisor's bad reviews we would have known. Too many people have had this happen to them. Bikeshare refunded half, and their customer service was able to explain clearly on the phone that this is the procedure, but nowhere in the written verbiage does it indicate this odd procedure. The procedure makes sense if one thinks about the bikeshare being a commuter service first, but tourists need better information about this funny check-in, check-out thing. I had checked out the website to see how it worked beforehand, and $8 for 24 hours seemed simple enough. The grid of pricing shows upcharges for time ranges, but the overriding message was $8 for 24 hours and so the upcharges felt like they belonged to a different category. I am disappointed that such a great idea and well executed system cannot simply add this language to their website or FAQs. I have no doubt that tourists like me might have chosen to pay some upcharge for the convenience of having them out for longer, OR we would have enjoyed the challenge of finding docks every 30 minutes like a treasure hunt. I would guess that the 25% of 1 star reviews (at this writing) would be 4's or 5's if they would fix this problem of understanding. AND I think Bikeshare would earn their upcharges with knowing consumers rather than getting the upcharges from consumers who end up feeling deceived. Just so unnecessary. PLEASE note the procedure and the upcharges if you go past 30 minutes without docking, and THEN have a great ride!\n",

      "Renting bikes to sight see is always a good idea, which we (2 adults) did for an evening, paying Cn22.31 for 24 hr \"membership\". We spent 3 hours with the bike, and later, back home we had the very unpleasant charge of an extra Cn$116.30. Thought there was a scam, somebody cloned our card, etc and called the company. We were then informed that you need to park the bike every 30 min and take it out again not to incur extra charges. And those charges get progressively bigger...and where were those stations where you were supposed to \"check your bike in out\" placed? Are we all supposed to ride for only 30 mins and look for those bloody bike stations rather than enjoying the scenery, monuments, etc...? Most people won't do that or go over time by the time they could find such things. Designed to be a perfect scheme to rip people off, who, like us, thought, as in many countries we have visited, we could keep the bike for a determined amount of time for a fixed charge. I noticed as i was posting that I was not the only one that felt to that sad scheme. Taking advantage of people who actually prefer to rent a bike to see the city being ecologically friendly.

The city is very bike friendly.....there are bike lanes as well as ramps on sidewalks. The way this works is you pay a membership fee either for 24 hours ($8) or you can do 3 days ($17) then you pay each time you use the bike. If your ride is less than 30 minutes it is free so the best thing to do is have a plan and once you enter your code to get your bike ride there and drop the bike at the nearest station. Once you set up your initial account then it reads off of your credit card and it is much quicker to get bikes. Make sure when you drop your bike the light is green and the bike is secure before you walk away. \n",

      "The good:We really enjoyed riding the bikes down the Mall to the Washington Monument. The bikes were solid and easy to ride. (Even for short people.) Saved a lot of time and was a fun way to end the first day. The cautionary tales:1) We needed 2 bikes and there were 2 in the rack. However, one had a red light, which we found out meant it was out of order. So, we had to walk one bike to a second station to rent the 2nd bike.2) read the review thread about checking your bikes into the docking station every 30 min. This didn't happen to us, but it easily could have since we used them just under 30 min and we didn't know about that rule.3) Take a video of yourself docking the bikes in. We followed the instructions and our station had the correct sounds & lights, plus the bike was securely docked. (we tried to pull each out). HOWEVER, the docking station must not have been working because after we left, someone took one bike out and kept it for 12 hours. We were charged $97.Fortunately after 5-6 calls they refunded the money (1/2 at first, then the other 1/2).We had lots of documentation of our whereabouts due to google tracking, etc. but could have used a video of us docking the bikes.

      "My boyfriend and I decided to rent bikes through \"Capital Bikeshare,\" as we saw it as a great way to get around to all the monuments in a decent amount of time and it was. That said, the pricing of the bike rental timeframes is totally misleading!! For example, we decided to do the 24hr pass for $8 each, even though we knew we wouldn't keep the bikes for that long. That said, 24hrs for $8; can't beat it, right?! Well, that is definitely not the case and judging from the numerous negative reviews read since receiving an additional $76 charge two days post-docking our bikes for good, we are not the only wrongly informed consumers who have been charged outrageous prices unknowingly. After seeing the additional $76 dollar charge, I typed an email to \"Capital Bikeshare\" inquiring (I will update this review when I hear back) about the charge. I also looked through all of their \"FAQ's\" and \"Help\" portions of their website; however, nothing touched upon this topic. I was extremely concerned, so I went to the ever trusting \"tripadvisor\" for help and learned that Capital Bikeshare does not have a great reputation with consumers and their misleading prices have affected many travelers pocketbooks! \"Capital Bikeshare\" really needs to be upfront and honest regarding their costs and additional charges, and even if these extra charges are listed in the fine print (I have not read this yet), my personal opinion is that they need to make it more visible /noticeable at each docking station, as I have gathered that most often \"Capital Bikeshare\" is a spur of the moment type of purchase; it was for us anyway, and the only rates we noticed were the very low-cost prices front and center and no warning of extreme additional charges. Through my readings on tripadvisor, I noticed that one reviewer stated when she called Capital Bikeshare, they told her that the $8 pass is for 24hrs, but it only covers the first 30 minutes. If you do not want to be charged, you must check in every 30 minutes at a docking station. This to me is complete trickery of Capital Bikeshare. It also creates an inconvenience for the customer, as there are very few docking stations around and I didn't notice a single one near the memorial district, which is largely the area traveled with the bikes. All in all, I will NEVER use Capital Bikeshare again; they are a rip off company!\n",

      "They false advertise a 24hr pass for $8. After paying that, you must redock the bike every 30 minutes so you do not incur additional charges. After keeping our bikes for 4 hours I owed over $60. Advertisement is not readily available. Even on their website it doesn't call out the true cost until the very bottom. I would just be very aware of what you are getting yourself into. \n",

      "Metro can be unreliable and its stations too sparse sometimes. Traffic is too horrible for car or rideshare especially near the Mall. Walking is sometimes not a realistic option between two points.The perfect solution? Biking! But not everyone especially visitors has a bike, so Capital Bikeshare solves that problem!This bike-sharing program is seriously the best innovation I've seen in DC! Years ago when I first got to DC, getting around was a hassle, but with Capital Bikeshare, I could explore more on bike during my 2nd time back in DC. With so many bike docks throughout the city, it's usually not a problem finding an available bike unless you are around super-popular point like Lincoln Memorial.If you have at least a day pass, you can use the bike as many times as you want without extra charge as long as you ride for less than 30 minutes each time. Just make sure if you dock your bike properly (wait for the light to turn green) after you're done or else you'll be charged after 30 minutes! Use the Metro or rideshare to cover the extreme distances, but if you are traversing medium to short distance especially throughout the National Mall, I highly recommend using Capital Bikeshare!\n",

      "These bikes were everywhere and it was a great way to get around as the monuments are very far apart. It is a bit confusing at first...you rent with a credit card and there is a charge for being a \"member\" $8. Then, I think, $2 per 1/2 hour. The charges were a bit confusing. They only allow you to rent 2 bikes at a time and we needed 3 and put them on 2 different cards. They do hold an amount on your credit card (about $100-$150 for each bike). You can return them to any station throughout the city, however, there needs to be an empty space to put it in. This might be difficult sometimes. They don't provide helmets. In the city, you have to ride on the street and there are no bike lanes (not ideal for kids). When you are on the National Mall, you can ride on the paths, however, there are a lot of people and other bikes. Good experience and would do it again.\n",

      "My son and I used bikeshare for a day on the mall. I had visited the website before renting the bikes and the policy of checking the bikes in every 30 minutes was clearly stated. The reviews by people claiming this is a scam demonstrate how many people don't read. There are docks all over the place and the website shows where bikes and docking spaces are available. We actually had an easier time finding bikes than free spaces. Even though we went over time on one segment, it was only an extra 4 dollars and the convenience and fun of the bikes was well worth the $20 we spent. I recommend checking the bikes in and out at every available dock to reset the timer and avoid extra charges. We will definitely do this again on our next visit to DC. \n",

I do not support this company.I do not support this company based on principal of their shady business practices.I do not have enough bad things to say about this company, their people, and their practices...I first rented a bike to take to the grocery store and the touch screens were broken and it was a very poor experience attempting to get a bike rental, given the screen didn't work well. I can only assume based on this experience that maybe they don't upkeep the equipment well enough. Okay, so bad first impression, but once i finally got a bike, it obviously worked fine as a bike should. No flats, no issues, no problems.The second time I rented a bike, it was for a \"24 hour\" period of time, quoted at \"$8\" for the entire period. Now comes the fun part... a few days later i was charged an additional $94!!Apparently, you are supposed to dock the bike every 30 minutes or else you will be charged outrageous amounts for the time (that you supposedly already paid for). This is not disclosed in an obvious location or anywhere in the prompting on the tiny screen in front of you. This is only noted in the extremely long and arduous to read \"Terms & Conditions\" (which by the way is about 156 pages or so, and would take hours to read on the tiny screen provided for you)I immediately called Capital Bikeshare to dispute this charge and see if they would give me a one time waive, considering I did not damage the bike and followed what I had believed were the appropriate procedures. I spoke with 1 lady, Lawanda, who was a smart-alec and not helpful... She was only offering a 50% reduction of my fee and was trying to help get management (UNACCEPTABLE). Unfortunately I had to hang-up for another call coming in. I then had to call back and spoke with Brandy, who could not get her phone off of speaker or was having some kind of feedback loop issue with the audio. That may not have been her fault, but regardless, not helping my frustrations. At this point I am incredibly fed up and disgusted with this company. I have read other reviews online dealing with similar situations I had only realized after the fact.\n",

Caveat #1: Prepare to have someone stay with the bikes as the rest of the group goes to visit monuments (e.g. Lincoln Memorial). Caveat #2: We had great difficulty finding empty spaces to return the bikes, had to go back and forth between sites looking for spaces which resulted in separating the family and wasting an hour of our precious visiting time.

      "We used Capital Bikeshare for one day on a recent trip to DC. The first day we walked around DC and by the end of it we were exhausted. The second day we got bikes first thing in the morning and used them all day! The way it works is you pay $8/per person for 24 hours of access. If you keep your rides under 30 min (not hard, there are loads of stations to trade your bikes out at/you'll want to go inside places and see things!) then the rides are free. If you go over 30 minutes, you have to pay additional charges (not much, I think they said it would be $1.50 for a 90 minute ride). I highly recommend this to tourists, you will thank yourself for saving your feet from walking and saving your bank account from getting taxis/ubers everywhere. \n",

You just have to be mindful of the time and park or check in and out at the next dock within the 30 minutes so that you don't incur additional fees. DC drivers seemed used to sharing the road with bikes as many locals have bikes too. We rode on both sides of the National Mall (our hotel was on the Air & Space side but we rode as far as the White House side) and around the museums and monuments and Capitol Hill. We even took the subway to the station near the Marine Memorial, walked a block to a dock, got bikes and rode 1 mile to the memorial and docked a block from there. Parked there and after spending some time there we checked bikes out again and rode back down to a dock and walked to the Metro station. So easy and fun!\n",

      "We are new to the Bikeshare system. However, after spending a day on the bikes we loved it. The app tells you the locations of the bike racks along with how many stations there are and the current number of bikes at the location. The cost for a bike for 24 hours was $8. This is hinged on you docking your bike at a bike station every 30 minutes. If you accomplish this there will be no additional fees on your credit card. However, if you do what my son-in-law did earlier in the week and not dock the bike the cost adds up fast. There are plenty of bike stations and bikes to get almost anywhere you want to go around the Mall.Also, we took 5 bikes out each time (2 per credit card) and the maintenance was excellent. If there is a problem with the bike you choose you just put it back in the rack and press the maintenance button and someone will fix the deficiency quickly.It was a great day.\n",

      "Renting a bike in a city used to cost $80 or so for the day, but Capital Bikeshare delivers that for $8. The trick is to keep each ride under 30 minutes each and you can ride all day for nothing more than the daily membership charge of $8. This is, more or less, personal rapid transit around a fairly flat city with a decent number of bike lanes, paths, and (outside the center) ride-able sidewalks.\n",

      "I loved the bike share program, especially the cell phone app that shows where the kiosks are and how many bikes are available. It was a little game to figure out where you could get to in 30 minutes to check your bike in and out for another 30 minutes. The bikes were all in good shape. Since my hotel was on a hill, I rode down to Georgetown and then to the mall area (all downhill). It was great to ride in Rock Creek Park. Washington is a very bike-friendly town. When I was finished for the day, I just hopped the metro back up the hill to the hotel.\n",

      "Made Our Trip Amazing\n",
      "My boyfriend and I visited DC for the first time this month to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. Being our first time and looking to keep it as a budget friendly trip, we were a bit nervous about how to navigate the city without spending a fortune on Taxi's or Ubers.Capital Bikeshare was our saving grace. I looked into hop on/hop off tours, bike rentals, segway tours...you name it, but they all came with hefty price tags.Bike Rentals were min $20pp per day. Capital Bikeshare has a 3 days Membership for $17pp. This allowed us to have unlimited trips for free for 30 minutes a trip.This allowed us to visit all of the monuments, museums and even bike the city a bit without any worries and saved us so much time. It was also SUPER hot and we were so thankful we had a bike to get us from point a to point b so quickly rather than spending more time in the humid hot sun.The APP is a MUST!!!! I used this APP all weekend not only for bike locations, but as a general GPS - lol. It was great being able to see where we were AND if there was bikes near by if we wanted to grab one.As highly as I recommend this to anyone visiting DC and how I will look into these services in any other city I visit, there is a slight downside which is why I scored them a 4/5 instead of a perfect 5.The downside is hoping to gosh the location you're going to either A) has bikes or B) has open spots for you to dock the bike. The app tells you how many bikes are available and how many open ports there are and is pretty real time, but it is not completely accurate, especially in the really busy locations. In the super busy locations like near the Lincoln Memorial, they truly need MORE bikes. We had a bike that took us there, docked it, and 20 minutes later when we wanted to move on, there were no bikes at the 2 closest locations. We probably spent a good 40 minutes between both stations waiting for a bike. At one point, we saw 3 bikes available, and in the 5 minutes it took us to walk across the street, they were gone. So then I saw that another station a few blocks away had 9 bikes. While we were walking there I saw it go down to 7, then 6, then 4..only for us to show up as a family was booking the last 4 bikes. This happened to us another time where we saw 4 bikes at a location and by the time we got there only 1 was left. And one time we got back to the station near our hotel and it was full so we had to ride 4 blocks away to dock it. Another couple was with us who didn't have the app. They were going to ride to the closest location which also didn't have any available docks so they followed us to the next one. While this didn't deter us from using it, we know it's just due to it being so popular and such a good option to get around the city, I just wish they had more stations, closer together incase of no docks or no bikes, and more bikes!\n",

      "The DC bike share program is fantastic! And the city itself is incredibly bike friendly- lots of bike lanes and accommodating drivers. When you rent the bike, the first 30 minutes are free, then it's $2 for the subsequent 30 minutes. However, if you dock the bike every 30 minutes you continually get the free 30 minutes. So, ride 30 minutes, dock the bike for 5 seconds and then take the very same bike out for another 30 minutes. There are docking stations all over the place, so it's pretty easy to find them. Remember to pass on the left and ring your bell! \n",

      "Questionable Business Tactics!!!!On July 11, while visiting DC, I rented a bike and returned it within 30 minutes. Upon returning the bike, I locked it in place, pulled it a couple of times to verify that it was safely locked, and walked away. The bike was now in the hands of Capital BikeShare and not mine. Days later, upon reviewing my bank statement, I noticed a $94 withdrawal by Capital BikeShare on July 13, in addition to the $2 for the July 11 rental. I had left DC on the 11th and was not in DC on July 13. When I called Capital BikeShare, I was told that I had used the bike for 14 hours......that I had not locked the bike in properly.......that I should have waited 1 minute for the green light to come on.......that other people had used that bike and I was charged for their use (because I failed to lock it in place).........All made up lies, when in fact I DID verify that the lock was firmly secured before I walked away AND only used their bike for 30 minutes on July 11.After repeated rude attempts to talk over me, \"Corey\" mumbled that he would submit a 50% refund. When I asked how Capital BikeShare was going to refund/correct the unauthorized withdrawal, he admitted that he did not know, and rushed to hang up. From the reviews I have read online, I suspect that this is their normal modus operandi. And they do not issue a receipt.Be aware!\n",

      "5 is a big number when it comes to cycle share. Actually any number bigger than 1 is an issue. We stayed on Capitol Hill and wanted to cycle the National Mall. Stop at the Lincoln Memorial. Then on to Georgetown. Easy. Finding 5 bikes was a bit of an issue, but the stations aren't far apart. The bikes are heavy, but sturdy and well cared for. Cost looks fair. It only becomes an issue if you are over an hour on any one journey. Ours would be easily under. The problem arrives when you want to drop off. The Mall stations were nearly full, though we managed. Georgetown was completely full. There are 4 stations and we visited them all. Only 1 slot was available. That makes a mockery of the system. You get heavily penalised in cost and can't do what you planned. Be careful. \n",

      "There are multiple stations everywhere for these bikes, so it's convenient. Also seemed like a lot of fun so our family wanted to get four bikes. We paid for four, but two wouldn't come out with the codes which were supplied at the kiosk. So, two of us rode the bikes and two of us walked to the next station we saw and immediately put them right back in the station. They just don't work well. Based on these other reviews I'm now seeing, I hope my credit card doesn't get charged for the two bikes we couldn't get out of the rack. Seems fun, but these things were just a pain to operate.\n",

We were using the app to try to find a place to return the bikes. We were in crowded dt DC and had to walk the bikes. The app would say there were open docks, so we would walk blocks only to find they were not open or not working. So we would walk blocks to another to find the same thing. We lost valuable vacation time, we were exhausted, and then to add insult to injury, we saw the bill. $300 for 5 bikes for about 2 1/2 hours. Be careful. \n",

      "I was in DC for work and wanted to cram in as much as I could in a very short period of time. Essentially, I did a self-led monument tour on bike, using the Capital Bikeshare program. It was really easy. I opted for the three day membership (I think this option was around 20 bucks) and then biked my heart out. So here is the deal, you get 30 minutes of each ride free. I downloaded one of the apps (I used D.C. Bikes) that shows you where all of the stations are. This handy app also has a timer that helps you remember when 30 minutes is almost up. So, when the timer hit 5 minutes or so, I looked for the closest station (using the app), docked the bike to return it, and then got another bike. If you make sure to return the bike before your free 30 minutes is up, you bike all over town for just the cost of the membership. A couple more pointers.. pick out your bike, adjust the seat, and know where you are going before you swipe your card. That way, you are ready to go and are not wasting time with all this while the clock is ticking. The bikes are a little heavy, but they get you where you are going. Happy biking!\n",

      "I didn't. That was a mistake on my part. Like everyone else, I thought that the $8 daily fee was reasonable. I didn't think that it would be a problem swapping out bikes. It was! If I were traveling by myself it wouldn't have been a problem. Traveling in a pair was a hassle; I wouldn't even think of traveling with a family or another couple. Like others have written, bikes aren't always available. Other times there aren't any docking stations. The kiosk display is difficult to read. At time you have to push the button extremely hard to get results. Who takes the time to read the 133 screen pages of the rental agreement? Bottom line: It was great breezing around town on the cruiser; however, I wouldn't do it again unless traveling alone. If you must rent these bikes, carefully dock the bike after use; wait for the GREEN light before you leave; don't wait until the last second to swap bikes and if you do follow the instructions to get your 15 minute credit. Customer service reduced my fees; don't take no for an answer if you are a first time user.\n",

Then the light turned red, so I thought, like ANY normal human being, the when the bike was still stuck in the dock and the light was red that I could get a different bike, nope.

We rented them under the assumption they were $8/day, which seemed reasonable, considering the bikes weren't in that great of shape anyway. The signs lead you to believe this is the true cost. If you don't dock the bikes every 30 minutes, it charges you by the minute and it's very expensive. We found docking stations but they were all full so we were not able to dock our bikes at all and had them out for 4 hours, resulting in the $8 PLUS over $60 in overage charges. I called to complain about the misleading nature of this and she said I should have read the sign better. Judging by the reviews on here, this seems to be a common error with people so perhaps this should be advertised better! I wouldn't ever use this bikeshare again.

She told me that a technician would come later to fix it.

We had no issue during these 2 returns, the lights were green, and I was very careful for that after my first experience on Friday I can tell you!!!Today I have been charged of 34 dollars of membership + 78 dollars!!!!!So when I called at 7:30am today, the person told me that I used a bike once for 5 hours!!!!It's impossible. Who is lying? I wonder...The person told me that she was requesting a refund of 50% for that extra charge, but it's not fair I need a full refund of the 78dollars.And the fact that because of the first trip (when the light was red), my mother and I were not able to use the bike afterwards until the person came to fix it.

      "Where would you end up paying $172++ for renting 2 bikes for a day? With Capital Bikeshare... Any regular European would expect the rental to be around $8 for a day, for 1 bike. That seems like a fair and normal charge, right? Would you investigate further and could you ever conceive of being charged $172 on top of the regular rental? Well, watch out, because they can simply slap it on your creditcard. Just like that... So here is where it went wrong for us. We did not understand that we had to dock the bike every 30 minutes. A simple misunderstanding that Capital Bikeshare takes full advantage of. We could have easily docked the bikes, because we used the bike to visit all the tourist sights. However, we were totally unaware that this needed to be done in order to get honored the $8 a day fee. And so, upon leaving Washington, we were presented with a $172 fee. Capital Bikeshare explained us the reasoning behind it, and we explained to them that if we had known of their rules, we would have docked the bikes accordingly. Cut a long story short, they were \"kind\" enough to refund $86. That still left me feeling totally robbed by them though. Will never use them again, and strongly recommend to rent elsewhere, for a day rental. Make sure to research other rental companies, because this one takes full advantage of you not knowing the full rules.\n",

      "Unfortunately I doubt we will ever use a bike share company again, barring the prices drop significantly. At first glance this seems like such a fantastic idea and such an amazing way to see our nation's capital. Unfortunately it is extremely expensive, I could have bought two used bikes on Craigslist in the capital for what we ended up paying for the two bike rental. 2 bikes for roughly 4 hours, came to a total of $124.00. And I do wish they had a water bottle holder. Also my bike kept slipping out of gear. The price really ruins the experience.\n",

      "We planned to see the sights using this scheme- after a vain attempt to get 3 bikes from one station we walked to another and managed. We used these for 40 minutes and then spent several hours at Arlington, getting the metro back to the city and then tried to get a further set of bikes. The kiosk informed us that we still had the bikes and so couldn't get anymore. A phone call to the help line established that 1 of the three had a problem with docking- but they could do nothing about it- we could either get back and sort the problem at the last the docking statiin ourselves or an engineer would look at it some time in the next 48 hrs. Meantime the charge was continuing. Not impressed with this as we have used the same system in London on many occasions with no problems. Will not try it again- we will hire bikes for the day as this is cheaper than the excess charges on this scheme\n",

They said that they would have to send a technician out to see if it was still there. Their computers monitor these things and they could have sent a technician when it \"pinged\" as the lady called it. Better yet, they could check their stations to see if they are functioning when they move around the bikes each day.\n",

      "Great way to traverse the Mall, but be watchful of your time !\n",
      "Capital Bikeshare is great, easy, and fun way to quickly zip around the National Mall taking in all the sights to see. My boyfriend and I took two bikes from the Jefferson Drive station - nearest the Washington Monument, and proceeded on a clockwise tour around the Tidal Basin taking in the Jefferson Memorial, George Mason Memorial, Tidal Basin sights and Cherry Trees, FDR Memorial, MLK Memorial, DC War Memorial, Lincoln Memorial, Reflecting Pool, Vietnam Memorial, 56 Signers of the Declaration and pool, the WWII Memorial, the White House, finally and Capitol Hill before riding our bikes back down the Hill past the Smithsonians and returning our bikes, ultimately back to the same original station on Jefferson Drive. Aggravatingly, between all those sights, there is only one station over between the FDR memorial and Lincoln memorial to park the bikes again and reset the 30 min free window of time. This makes it impossible to pay the $8 for a daily pass and maintain a free charge by staying under 30 mins, as there is simply not enough bike stations to check your bike back in, not to mention you'll find yourself easily spending at least 30 mins or more at each memorial if you really take your time to relax and take in the feeling of each sight. In the end, we were charged much more than we expected, but after doing the math it was the correct charge as advertised. In hind sight, I would do it again as riding the bikes sure did beat walking, (there is no way possible to cover that much ground on foot and not want to kill each other from exhaustion and aching feet), feeling the wind as you bike along, and laughing the whole way riding along made the entire experience on the Mall so much more enjoyable. Just be prepared to spend about $50 a person so you won't feel suckered when you see the charges appear on your card.\n",

      "We rented some bikes as an easy way to make it around to see the monuments in the mall and tidal basin area. We left from the Lincoln memorial where we easily rented two bikes. We rode around the basin and attempted to turn in our bikes by the Jefferson memorial only to find the station full. This shouldnt have been a big problem because you can get an extra 15 minutes if the station is full, but the kiosk was broken. So I called the number for help, and they were unable to provide us with an extra 15 minutes over the phone. Finally we rode back round to the Washington Monument and returned our bikes there. When we went to take out new bikes after touring the monument, we couldnt...not sure why, but it wouldnt let us take a new bike with our codes, so we gave up.

      "We used Capital Bikeshare for the two days we were in DC with our two teenagers, and it was a lifesaver, and so much fun! It allowed us to see all of the sights, more than once, without having to walk everywhere or take other transit. I see some people complaining about the lack of docking stations near the museums, or the cost being high, yet we didn't find either of these to be the case. The key is to read the instructions...you can do so ahead of time online at their website. There is also a free app you can download ahead of time to help you find the docking stations. We found stations near all the places we went (Lincoln memorial, Space museum, capital, our hotel, etc.). To use them the most economically...rent them for 24 hours or 3 days. Then, as long as each time you ride them it's 30 minutes or less until you check it back in to a docking station, there is no charge. So we just got the bike, rode to the next sight we wanted to see, checked the bike in, explored the sight, and then got another bike to ride to the next sight. If you lock it up, then you're going to be paying for all that time that you aren't using it...just find a station, dock it, and get another bike once you're done exploring the memorial or the museum. A couple of times we used the bike over 30 minutes (like when we rode to Arlington Cemetery), and it was just $2 more. THE KEY IS TO CHECK THE BIKE IN, EXPLORE, AND THEN GET ANOTHER BIKE. Our kids loved this, and we did, too. And doing this at night all around the mall to see the beautiful lights was the highlight of our trip. The paths are large, and easy to maneuver on the bikes. And even riding to our hotel or to a restaurant, as long as the sidewalks weren't super crowded, we could just ride on the sidewalks. The bikes have a bell on them, so you can alert walkers that you are approaching. This is the way to go in DC!\n",

We absolutely LOVED the bikes and we rode out to Jefferson Memorial which is hard to get to otherwise.

      "I try to bike in every city that I visit but knowing the horrendous traffic quagmire that is DC I was a little reticent about biking in DC. That was until two days ago when I took Amtrak to DC and decided to give Capital Bikeshare a try. What a great experience. The bicycles are in great shape, the kiosks are easy to use, the response time from the kiosks is quick, and the kiosks are located in very convenient locations. I would suggest that bikeshare find a way to let riders tell the system what maintenance needs to be done to each bike ( a missing bell on one, a slipping second gear on another).I was very brave and road up Mass Ave all the way to 15th Street from the very convenient Union Station Bikeshare kiosk. No muss, no fuss. Parked at 21st and M, went for coffee and then picked up a new bike to travel back across town to 7th and F. Capitol Bikeshare has a great website that makes it very easy to find where kiosks are located, if there are slots available at the kiosk of choice, and helps you plan your trips. I think that from now on when I am in DC I will skip the Metro, bus and cabs - I will use Capitol Bikeshare and have freedom from waiting in underground caverns for crowded subway cars, paying for parking in lots, and searching for elusive parking spaces.Next time you are in DC, give Capital Bikeshare a try.

So if you are going museum to museum you need to lock it to something. If you are seeing this review before you go to DC then bring a bike lock so you can lock it up. We had to skip the museums as I did not feel comfortable leaving the bikes without a lock while we toured. We did ride them from our hotel on H street all the way to the White House, Washington Monument, on to WWII Memorial, Lincoln Memorial and then to the Zoo.

      "Washington D.C. is not a city to ride a bike. The traffic is heavy, and the bike lanes are not safe (if they exist). Even if you decide to hire this bike, be aware that it costs 8 dollars for a day enrolment fee and then - it is free only first 30 minutes, then it is 2 dollars for the next 29 minutes and even more for the time to follow. With the Washington D.C. distances this means you have to pay constantly extra fees. Besides, if you are a tourist, it is always uneasy to find a bike stand (if you do not have mobile with the internet connection with you). It seems that these bike stands are deliberately hidden on the back streets, so you loose time just for looking for them and pay extra. And there are not enough of these stands. You can easily arrive with your bike and find no free slot to park it. Overall impression - Capital Bikeshare wants to earn money on you without thinking about your convenience and safety. In comparison to Vienna city bikes, for example, this provides bad impression. Not a single stand near National Gallery, or Space museum, of Natural History Museum, the most popular places. You have to make circles and circles in order to find a bike stand on the back side of the Orangery (not the most obvious place!) and to walk from there.\n",

      "Worth a try but know how the system works!\n",
      "First lets start off that people need to understand how this system works. Most of the complaints here are because they do not read or understand how the bikeshare works. Do people really think they are getting a bike for $8.00 a day and that is it? It is a membership and if you go over 30 minutes without checking in the bike there will be extra charges.Do keep in mind there will be bike stations that have no bikes or there are no docks. There will be bike that do not work and docks that are broken.You want to make sure if you are riding and pass a bike station to check the bike in,. You can not be sure your destination station will have empty slots. You can get 15 minutes extra time if there is no slots to drop the bike. However you need to know where the next station is. That may also be full. There are maps of the locations at the stations but there is no place at the station that you can check the status. There are apps available for cell phones but they are not that reliable. They are not always up to date or the app does not work. The Capital Bikeshare app it has for itself never worked. Try Spotcycle or others.We had two bikes and rode about 15 miles over the two days and 2 1/2 hours hours of use, It was easy to check in the bike and get the same bike out again. There we a few spots there were no empty slots. What we did if there was only one slot was to check in one bike, get it out again and check in the other bike and get that out again. That we we got another 30 minutes until we could find an open station. One time we had to go to 3 stations before we could return both bikes together. One time we had to check-in and leave one bike and then go drop the the other bike at the coral bike station at 13th and New York Ave then walk backKeep in mind commuters ride the bikes to downtown to work and take them back near their home. We found walking and riding around that most of the bike stations where full around the downtown area and the museums.during the day with people waiting for an empty slot to open up.We used the bike system for 2 days and had a day key card for convenience. We could have got a day membership or 3 day membership but then you have to use a code each time. There is also the question of the deposit charged for each bike. I never got a clear answer from customer service on this. We were not charged a deposit with the day key card.There is also a problem with Capital Bikeshare answering e-mails. They don't respond. Not once did they respond to any e-mails I sent in weeks prior to the trip. I ended up calling most times.. I also brought it to there attention of the negative reviews here and other sites that they should address. They did not seem to care.Still we wanted to give this a try. It worked out fine even with the hassle of finding a open bike station to drop a bike. The bikes are nice and study and easy to use.Give it a try but know how it works!\n",

      "Capital Bikeshare has over 350 stations with 3,000 bikes. There's no better way to see D.C., Arlington, Alexandria, and Montgomery County than by bike. There are stations along the National Mall and Iwo Jima in Arlington, exciting neighborhoods with restaurants and nightlife, and at Metro stations. You can buy a 24-hour or 3-day membership and then each trip under 30 minutes during your membership period is included in the membership price. If your trip extends beyond 30 minutes, there are additional usage fees of $2 for 30 - 59 minutes, $6 for 60 - 89 minutes, etc. Familiarize yourself with the pricing at: https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/pricing/ . Keep your trips under 30 minutes and the membership fee is all you pay.This isn't bike rental, it's bike transit and designed for short transit trips. Use the bike while you need it. Return it once you don't need it anymore. If you want a leisurely bike ride for the day, rent a bike. There are so many stations that Capital Bikeshare can get you where you need to go. Here's the station map: https://secure.capitalbikeshare.com/map/ .Enjoy!\n",

Your 24-hour rental for which you think you are paying $8 when you select that option on the screen is NOT $8. You are actually renting the bike for 30 minutes! The 24 hours is simply the amount of time your access code will be valid. If you keep that bike longer than 30 minutes you're going to rack up some hefty \"overtime\" charges. Apparently, that bit of information is buried in the fine print. Very misleading, in my humble opinion. I will NOT be using this service again!\n",

      "We are a family of 6. This is prob a great service for two people to take advantage of but MAJOR flaws for a family with 4 kids! We started the rental process which is rather cumbersome and takes several minutes per bike. We only wanted to go from the Lincoln Memorial to the Holocaust museum so seemed easy enough. We got two bikes out (clock starts running on rental time as soon as that first leaves the docking station) and discovered the following:- We discovered the hard way that you can only rent TWO bikes per credit card ACCOUNT. Although we had four credit cards between us, we could only rent 4 bikes because they were linked to only two accounts. (our other Visa number was stolen at the start of our trip and that account was shut down). The machine spit out ticket codes and it took quite awhile for us to realize it was simply reissuing the rental code numbers that didn't work. After we gave up and I RAN the entire way in 98 degrees trying to keep up with my kids on their bikes, my husband realized it was just Reissuing the codes that my daughters had already used to release their bikes. By the time we rented the first four bikes, and gave up on the last two, we were probably already 15 minutes into our rental period. When we got to the docking station nearest the Holocaust museum, there weren't enough open slots to dock the four bikes.... so we needed to find another location a few blocks past our destination, return the bikes there, and then come back on foot. (Our kids are 16, 14, 12, & 10.... the 10 year old just barely was able to reach the pedals with the seat lowered all the way. There are no helmets so bring your own)\n",

There were a few times we noticed that the preferred location for drop off or pick up was going to be full/empty so double check the website before and plan your route for your best experience.

If you go longer than that prepare to open a vein and pay in green hulk blood. 5.5 hours cost me 78 bucks? Seriously? I called into my credit card to dispute it and they did a three way call with me to Capital Bike share who said as a courtesy they could remove half the initial 70 dollar charge so they gave me back 35 bucks.

      "So this morning I was charged $62 by capital bike share and I was very upset about that. I was upset because I rented bikes yesterday for me and my friend for 24 hours which was supposed to only be $16. So this morning I called customer service number about the charge and the lady said I was charged $62 because apparently we are supposed to return them every 30 minutes or they would charge fees. First of all I would like to say when we rented the bikes we didn't see that rule ANYWHERE!!! Second of all, I don't think that's a smart rule to have because why should people have to check-in the bike every 30 minutes when most people get it for an all day bike ride. People should not have to worry about finding a capital bike dock station and worry about getting charged if they don't check-in on time. I genuinely feel I’ve been wronged/scammed because again I did not see that rule anywhere on the screen when I was renting the bikes and neither did my friend. And I know they do that on purpose to make more money, mostly targeting tourists. But THIS NEEDS TO STOP NOW!!! Im seeing more and more people complaining about this problem.

      "In one weekend had the extremes of experiences with Capital Bikeshare. One day of rental was fun and we got the hang of returning the bikes every 30mins. Although be prepared to find full bike stations that you have to use the app and be racing to find a location before you get an extra charge. The next day we decided to rent again, biked over to the Botanical Gardens, came out and couldn't check out 2 bikes. Calling customer service told us one bike was still checked out, we had checked both in and got the green light when docking. Since we now couldn't get 2 bikes we had to walk back across town to our hotel and were in poor spirits now that a bike was in our name that we didn't have. Customer service told me they would call me with updates, they never did, I called every hour with minimal updates, had to leave DC not knowing the resolution to the issue. Thankfully bike was returned and they did credit day of rental to me. Although half of my weekend to DC was ruined and their customer service needs significant improvement in how they talk with customers and choice of phrasing in email communications. The right thing to do would have been to let me rent out a 2nd bike so we could have enjoyed the rest of our Sunday. I have since asked around and will use Bike and Roll the next time I return to DC.

      "I’m echoing what others have said, which is that this is kind of a scam. The way the website is laid out seems to be intentionally misleading, stating “Membership and Usage Fees”, with a chart below that clearly shows “24 hour $8”, “3 Day $17”, etc. but you have to scroll down to see that usage fees are listed - and charged - separately. I had the bike for 3 hours and was charged the $8 at the terminal, and then got hit with a $38 charge later on my card. When I called them I was told you have to re-dock the bike every 30 minutes to avoid the fees. We were in DC as tourists and thought the bikes would be a great way to see the memorials, and when we were done we couldn’t find a station with 2 open spots so I had to go a mile out of our way to find somewhere to drop mine. But this was all too bad for me, as the supervisor, Bud, told me. He was clearly unconcerned with my plight and reduced the charge somewhat, but not entirely. In doing some further research I’ve also found that the company has received $16 million in government subsidies as it is supposed to be helping low-income people commute and maintain employment. Good luck with that with the fees they charge! There’s no way anyone on a tight budget could handle these, and the company is clearly looking to make a big, fat profit off anybody who doesn’t read and understand the convoluted rules – while also taking our tax payer dollars. Really, really disappointing.\n",

      "We really enjoyed the bike share. We used it to hop off and on, to get to different points all around the city. You do need to be mindful of the time, as the cost is $8/ day, then charged by the half hour for use. The first 30 min is free, but if you keep it longer than that, the charges add up fast. It is meant to be taken out, ridden somewhere and docked within 30 min. It is $2/30 min after that. If you want to bike more, sign it out again and you get another 30 min free to go somewhere else..... So just remember to dock it every 30 min, as you go from site to site,memorial to museum. It really is very convenient. There is even an app that will tell you how many bikes are available at any given location. A couple other points- only 2 bikes are allowed per credit card, so for our family of four we needed 2 credit cards. Also, if there is a red light on the bike in the dock, it means it is broken and can't be signed out. Bottom line- use it as to and from transportation, dock it while you are in places, and enjoy!! If you want a bike for the whole day, rent from a store, not from this commuter service! \n",

      "As there is no metro coverage in the mall and other memorial site areas a must is to rent bikes--there are rental spots all over town where you pay one first price then can ride for 30 minutes at no extra charge--works great to just keep swapping them out as you go from site to site along the mall and around town. We used it back to hotel as well. Kids do fine on them. Very sturdy if a bit heavy bikes but most of DC fairly flat so no big deal. We did not have helmets and had no prob with that. We used bikes for a couple days working through the memorials etc, then used Metro for longer hops on different days. The bike stations really are all over the place so assuming you have a map or smart phone it is quite easy to hit them before your 30 minutes runs out or don't sweat it if you miss as the price is not much. Service is good if you have a technical glitch--just call and they can reset or tell you what to do. 2 bikes per credit card so families need more than one card.\n",

      "I purchased a one day permit for renting a bike on two separate days. At the terminal the small screen showed 138 pages of terms of condition difficult to read and somewhere in this text the Company claims the bike has to be docked every 30 min to avoid a late fee. I didn't see it or maybe the sun blocked my view at the scren. This has resulted in a late fee of 94 dollars per day as I rented a bike 2 separate days. I rented in the morning and biked around for 5-6 hrs. My receipts clearly states the use is for more than 30 min and paid for 24 hrs use and NOT that I HAVE to dock every 30 min. My 2 day bike rental amounted to 202 dollars and I am shocked this Company still can get away with it. I will definately contact the Tourist Authorities and warn (hopefully put pressure) about this company's business methods.\n",

      "Pros: I love this program. You can rent up to 2 bikes per credit card. Pick up at one location and drop off at any other location (which there are a lot of around DC). It was a lifesaver for us today. We were able to see all of the Tidal Basin, Monuments, and most of the National Mall this afternoon, after the museums closed (at 5 p.m.). They come with a little bell that you can ring and people will move over for you; and a carry area in the front that you can place your stuff in. You get a code after you pay that you type in and unlock the bike. Then, when you're done, you just shove it back into place and wait for the green light....and you're done.A 1 Day, 3 Day, Month, & Year passes are available. The first 30 min are free then there is a fee after that. All the fee information can be found at: https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/Con: Helmets are not available to rent. No bike locks available. *** This is much better than some of the other rental options (like Bike & Roll DC) which charge much more; and have more stringent return requirements (like your bike has to be returned by 6 pm when they close).\n",

      "As I said, this is not a scam. All the reviewers saying this is a scam must have misunderstood, or ignored the pricing guidelines on the website. The pricing can be a bit tricky to follow, and they definitely try to hide the fact that there is a deposit per bike of about $100, but it's there, you just need to read, and you will see it.The bikes were in good shape, the pricing is good, and there were plenty of bikes, and bike docks around the city. I am only taking a point off because my wife and I did run across a bike dock that was full, and we found no simple directions to redeem an extra 15 minutes for finding another bike dock, as stated in the website, so we ended up going into the next half hour because of this.The other star I'm taking off is for the complete lack of either a mobile app, or least somewhat mobile-friendly site. The station map on the Capital Bikeshare website is darn near impossible to use on a smart phone!! The map squishes up into a tiny little part of the screen that is very difficult to use.Overall, it was a good experience.\n",

      "My son and I did a 3 day member rental at $15pp after we walked 10miles in one day and were exhausted. Your 1st 1/2 hour is free each time you rent a bike and then it is about $2 pp. for each 1/2 hr. after that. All you do to avoid the extra fee is ride less than 1/2 hour, dock the bike then re-rent. You get another fresh free 1/2 hour. According to the Bike share website 96% of DC members don't go over a 1/2 hr. ride. They have bike share stations all over the tourist area, the mall, downtown, Chinatown, etc. You can even rent them in Arlington. I would definitely recommend using the spot cycle app or capital bike share app because it lets you know how many bikes are available (or not available) at each station and where the stations are at. They are 3 speed, wide tire, wide seat mountain bikes with quick release seats and front and back automatic lights. DC's bike routes and paths are very easy to access and work great to avoid all the crowds walking on the sidewalks. I would highly recommend this to a family with teens and would definitely do this again when I return to DC.\n",

      "This is a great idea: Bikes can be rented from any of numerous stands, and then returned to any stand when you are finished. It is a very easy process: Pay with a credit card, take out a bike, and then return it. We rented three 3-speed bikes with good sized, comfortable, adjustable seats that were in fine condition. It is a perfect way to get around to see all of the monuments without having to walk.There are two downsides, however, so be prepared. One is unavoidable: the crowds. You will likely have to weave your way through plenty of people, most of whom seem oblivious to bikes. Thankfully, they \"kind of\" move aside when they hear the bell, which is thoughtfully provided on each bike. Second, be very aware of the pricing. The company claims that the first 30 minutes is \"free,\" but that isn't really the case, since you have to pay a \"daily membership\" fee plus fees for each half hour. A two hour rental cost $20, and you can easily eat up two hours just riding around the Mall.Still, this is a wonderful alternative to walking and it is especially welcome on a sunny warm day!\n",

      "We visited Washington last Saturday and it was very hot. We had researched Capital City Bike Tours and knew the drill re the 30 minute 'free' period.We loved the freedom on the bikes and saved our legs, enabling us to cover a lot more ground. A couple of fishhooks that other travellers should be aware of. We visited 4 bike hire stands in Georgetown before we found some with spaces ( there were 4 of us) eventually we had to split up and return two while the others biked off to find another.) it was so hot we were very tetchy and over it by the time we did eventually get rid of our bikes and caught a taxi back to Foggy Bottom after dinner.The next day we picked up bikes again from Foggy Bottom and had planned to visit Arlington Cemeterey, when we arrived we were told no bikes in the cemetery and so we split up- two watched the bikes and two of us made a very quick visit, then we swopped over. Either Capital Bikes need a bike stand there or don't plan to visit by bikes . We got stung $22US when we eventually dropped the bikes back. To make matters worse , we couldn't get a second bike , to bike back to Foggy Bottom, the machine kept saying we had had the maximum (two per credit card) we think perhaps the person before us who had a problem with his bike hire may have got our ticket ??? anyway we walked back to our hotel. I hope the people at Capital Bikes take note of both our problems and perhaps are able to rectify for other clients . It is great service and I would use again but probably not to Georgetown in the weekend as due to no metro in the area the bikes are well used and racks all full. They do have a service which allows you an extra 15 minutes and tells you where there are spaces but by the time we biked there they were all taken. We didn't mind paying an extra $2 for the second half hour but we were just over 2 hours for the hire to Arlington and that was $22 each which was a bit steep for the students in our group.\n",

Taxis would have been cheaper.The bikes were good and serviceable, but the charges are exorbitant.\n",

      "We were in DC for a week and after walking all day our first two days we decided to do something different. We read the reviews for Bikeshare which was very helpful. We only bought a 3-day pass and for $28 for this family of four you can't beat it. I would highly recommend getting the bikeshare app, otherwise as a tourist you would be lost. I would also NOT recommend making your first tour use of this service for exploring the monuments at night. We, of course, did this and it's difficult to find the docking stations at night when you have a 30 minute window. Except for our run from the Archives Metro station to the Jefferson Memorial, this was an excellent way to see DC (our first run was too long for us since we were unfamiliar with the process and we almost didn't make it in the 30 minute time frame). Pros and Cons:Pro: If you want to have an easy way to get between memorials/sites and you don't want to have to worry about bringing a bike lock, this is perfect.Pro: Bikes were in good shape, easy to use (and to change seat height) and docking stations were convenientCon: You can only check out two bikes with one credit card, so it was a little time consuming to check the bikes out each time (had to use two credit cards and click though some questions).Con: Really this might just be for us, but we didn't bring helmets so we had to bike without themPro: Bike paths are very accessible and take you everywhere you'd want to go.Con: At night, we accidentally rode into the FDR memorial (thought we were still on path), the ranger was very polite in asking us to get off our bikes (we just felt terrible)Con: We wish the time frame was more like 45 minutes to an hour, but that might change the whole purpose of the bikeshare programAgain for a family of four (daughters 14 and 12), this was a great option. If we did it again, we'd go for the 3-day pass.\n",

      "This is hands down the best way to see DC. We bought a 3-day pass, and it was well worth the $15. Once you pay your membership fee, any trip under 30 minutes is free, with additional fees applying after your half-hour is up. We would often take the Metro to one area of DC, check out bikes, and check them in again whenever we wanted to stop and take in a sight. This saved us the extra fees and the hassle of needing to find a safe place to leave your bike. My biggest tip is to download the Spotcycle app, which lets you see which racks have bikes and open stations. It saved us a ton of time, especially when we were exploring the memorials and tidal basin area.\n",

You can pick them up and drop them off whenever, wherever, and how ever many times you want. There is a $2 fee if you use the bikes for more than 30 minutes, but to get from one place to the next, this is not a problem. There was a station right across the street from our hotel, which was perfect. As for me, I know if I tried to walk all over DC, I would get tired real quick and that would slow me down. This way, you can ride to wherever you need to go, with no trouble. I highly suggest taking advantage of the Capital BikeShare if you would like to see DC in the most efficient and enjoyable way!\n",

      "These bikes are absolutely amazing! We got the three day membership for $15 dollars and have been using the bikes all day, every day! We ride for 25 minutes then find the nearest docking station and switch bikes to avoid any charges, it's working perfect.Reviewers that say it's misleading are completely at fault, not the company. The signs are very straight forward and tell you exactly what to do. If you want to ride a bike all over the city for one day you pay a $7 membership fee PLUS any additional time beyond 30 minutes. Their intention is to get people from point A to point B only, not to keep a bike all day. After you pay the membership fee, it's free to take a bike for 30 minutes, after that you pay $2 for 31-60 minutes, $6 for 61-90 minutes and then $8 for each additional 30 minutes! Yes, they are actually penalizing you for keeping a bike all day and rewarding you for returning a bike after 30 minutes! Just go from dock to dock like we did and it's all free (except for the membership fee). Who in their right mind thinks they can rent a bike for 24 hours (or more) for $7??There are tons of docking places throughout the city and you can very easily find a dock within the free 30 minutes. Dock your bike then get a new code and un-dock the same bike, it's that easy! We have been all over from Capitol Hill to Dupont Circle to Georgetown to Arlington and have only had to pay the initial membership fee! Sweet deal!I highly recommend the bikes, don't hesitate, just follow the simple guidelines and you'll see more monuments and sites than you can imagine. You'll also do it way cheaper than the metro or cabs and you get to stay in total control of stopping and restarting. A real benefit is the wind blowing through your hair on a hot day - something you don't get when walking!\n",

      "I was in Washington D.C. this past week and decided to utilize their bike share program. To be fair, I am from Chicago and a member of the Divvy program which is run the same way so my familiarity with the system is high. I ended up explaining how the program worked to someone who was looking quizzically at the instructions on one station.Things to know:*You can buy a 24 hour or 3 day pass*This pass is good for unlimited use in that time frame however, you must redock your bike every 30 minutes in order to not be charged excess usage fees*You swipe a credit card to get started following the onscreen instructions*You will receive a 5 digit code which you can use to unlock any of the bikes at the station*Be aware that if a bike needs servicing, the seat may be turned around to show that it should not be selected*I suggest you set your seat height, numbered for future rental use, and any bags in the open sided basket before you enter the code to remove the bike*To remove the bike you may have to lift the rear of the bike to angle it out of its dock*Get on, make sure the bike work, watch for traffic and roll*Redock your bike, go back to the kiosk and reswipe your credit card to get a new release code to take a bike back out. The wait time to redock and get a new bike is about 30 seconds I believe. Use the same credit cardI highly recommend you download the free app SpotLab which will show you the location of other docks and offers a timer.I rode over to the National Mall and had a great time riding around, however I found that there was a surprising limitation of bike docks where I thought there should have been. There were no docks by the Vietnam Memorial and you cannot/should not bring your bike into any of the monuments anyway.There are a decent amount of bike lanes in DC that I would recommend riders use.The app said there was one open dock by the Lincoln Memorial, however when I got there and rechecked, there were in reality no open docks. I think there was an issue reading one of the bikes. I reswiped the previously used credit card to request 15 more minutes to try and find another open dock.I also used the bike to ride around various neighborhoods on my way back to DuPont circle area. It was a great way to see some of the homes, offices, consulates and was very enjoyable. However, always be a careful rider and obey your signals and stop signs. Nothing ruins a day more than ending up splat on the hood of a car, especially if you blew the right of way.\n",

Registering at a rental station was not as easy as explained, some cards were not liked even though advertised as accepted. Some better/updated explanation panels are needed.Had fun cycling around. If you time it right, you can make use of the first free 30 minutes of use (after paying the $7 day membership) and swap bikes before your paid minutes start counting.Nice way of getting around and seeing the sights and getting to know a large area in a short time. On The Mall and surrounding streets you are allowed to cycle on the sidewalk by exception.\n",

      "We spent five days in DC sightseeing and 10 plus miles a day on concrete is hard on the legs. Our last day there we decided to do the capital bikeshare and what a wonderful way to see the city! I see some reviews about the site being misleading, it's not, you just need to read the instructions. They spell it out very clearly. NEED TO KNOW ABOUT RENTAL:If you read their website and understand how it works you'll be happy.* There are a few different options, getting a key or getting a code. Since we just rented one day so we did the code. Each time you want a bike you swipe the CC you reserved the bike on and it will print you out a code. You can choose a bike and go. * Understand the pricing structure. For the daily rental it was a $7.00 base charge. Each time you unlock a bike you get the first 30 minutes free and then an additional rate is charged for each section of time. Example: We rented and rode to the National Cathedral (and got lost) so it took us longer than 30 minutes, think it was about 55 minutes, we had an additional $2.00 charge for that specific trip since it took us 55 vs 30 minutes. The rest of the day we rented five more times (back to the mall and didn't get lost, around the tidal basin, up the mall and a few other stops in between) and there was no additional charges since we kept each trip to under 30 minutes. Over all we put on 28 miles and paid $9.00 for the day which I think it really reasonable.*There are bike racks all over the city, there's a great app to tell you how many bikes are available and how many slots are open. The BIKES:These are NOT commuter bikes, and they were a far cry from the road bike I am use to. They are heavy, there are only three speeds and they are built for ALL body types. I wouldn't plan on riding one out to Mt. Vernon by any means. But they are great around the city and mall and for stents under 10 miles. The bikes we had were all in good condition and were comfortable. They also do not come with helmets. If you stick to the trails it's not a bid deal, but riding up to the Cathedral was a little hair-raising in DC traffic. If your planning ahead pack a helmet. Great to see a program like this, very user friendly and a great way to see the sites.\n",

It leads you to believe you will be paying $7 for 24hrs which seems very fair and reasonable. This is not the case and I was charged over $20 for 2 hours only. This is very disappointing, as no one renting these bikes would have read through every single agreement written on those small screens before renting their bikes. It is unfair and this company is taking advantage of the fact that tourists would rent the bikes without reading each and every single page of agreements.

      "The Capitol Bikeshare in Washington is one of the best that I've experienced. There are tons of stations around the city, and it's super easy to get around. It also helps that there are many bike trails and bike lanes, so there are designated spots for bikers. The city is very bike friendly because the population is mostly young and 40% of the people don't own cars. This means that the cars are also well aware of bikers and are used to them on the road, which helps.The way it works is this:1. Get a membership. It's $7/day or $15/3 days or more for longer periods (you can get a yearly or monthly membership also I believe)2. Use your credit card at any of the bike stations in the machines provided to buy the membership of your required length3. Once you buy the membership, you will get a 5 digit code. Use this code to enter on the little pad beside each bike. Once the light turns green, pull out your bike (sometimes have to use two hands)4. The membership allows you unlimited use of the bikes in (and this is the important part) - 30 minute intervals. This means that you will have no additional charges if you return the bike to another station within 30 minutes. The city is small enough that most places can be reached within the 30 minute limit. The point of this is to allow other people to use the bikes as well, and the bikes are meant as a form of getting from point A to point B, not keeping the bikes for the entire day (although you can do this, but you may end up paying hundreds of dollars, like the poor chap that called the service a scam below. It's not a scam - you just have to read the instructions properly. You are charged for every additional hour you don't return the bike). If you don't think you'll make it in time to your desired station, you may stop at another station and request additional time. You do this by inserting your credit card, and pressing the 'renew' button. This allows you an extra 15 minutes to get to the next station that is closest to your destination, or if the station you wanted is full and there is no space to leave the bike.5. If you require the bike for longer than 30 minutes, you may return to the station, wait 5 minutes (or walk to the next station) and get another bike, repeating the process above. The five digit code you get the first time will only be active for 5 minutes from the time you get it. Every time you want a new bike, you'll have to get a new code by inserting your credit card into the machine. Your credit card will not get charged again - it's only used to determine that you've already purchased a membership and to get a new code.6. Returning the bike, make sure you push it in hard into the stand, and make sure the green light comes on - this means the bike is locked back in.. 7. For those that have smart phones, you can download the Capital bike app (available on their website or from the app store) that will give you real-time information about how many bikes are available at each station or how many free spaces are available, so you don't have to waste time looking for the next available station if the one you want is full, or doesn't have bikes. It's also handy because it gives you the locations of all stations.There are many stations around the city and it's very easy to use and get around. In the three days that we rode around, there was only one instance where the station was full and we had to find the next one (5 minutes away - press the 'renew' button to get more time). Since we didn't have data services, we didn't have the real-time information for which stations were full/empty, but we could still see the station locations. We found that biking was more convenient and cheaper than the metro because there are more bike stations than there are metro stations, so it was easier to get closer to our desired destinations. Not to mention being able to get a better look at the city, and get some exercise.If you use the service properly, you'll have a great experience.\n",

      "When we arrived in DC, with very little planned for our day trip from NYC, we had no idea where to start, but right out the front of union station I spotted these little babies and off we went. It is just like the 'Citi Bikes' bike share system in NYC, and I love both equally as much. It was a great way for us to see every along the national mall (I was ignorant to the sheer size of the place), and thankfully there was bike ports almost everywhere. We also tested the friendship (half hr free rule) by riding into Georgetown, and lucky for us we made it. It is a great way to see the Capital, and an entertaining one at that.I would highly recommend it!\n",

      "I rode a lot this time I visited DC. Very convenient. It is better than using taxi or driving cars around town. There are many stations around town. And the number is growing day by day. Some minor gripes. It is not always easy to find the stations at night even if you have a map. There is no options for kids. Some bikes needs maintenance. I wish there is a clock on the bike telling how much time you have spent, since it charges fees for a ride over 30 mins. I wish there is a way to get safety helmets. Pretty good. Highly recommended.\n",

      "I have been in DC for nearly a year and I never tried the red bikes yet until last weekend. I always see people going around with those red bikes and I pass by the bike stands every day on my way to work. So we (my boyfriend) rented 2 bikes for more than 4 hours and we paid $42 ($7 each for daily membership fee, the first 30 minutes is free, $2 per hour onwards). DC is a bike friendly place with dedicated bike lanes in most areas. You can pedal your way in the sidewalks too and the people respectfully give way to you.Compared to walking from one site to another, biking is way better! And it is more beautiful and magical at night! You can return the bikes anywhere as long as there is an available stand to accommodate your bike. As we returned them and had dinner in Chinatown, we were able to get them back (since we already paid the $7 day membership) and continued with our sight seeing.You pay using your card and it has been a week since, I believe it is well secured for using cards.It was a very fun and exciting experience and I'm set to being a biking tour guide when I have friends coming over to the nation's capital.\n",

      "For $7 per 24 hours you can check at a 3 speed bicycle from one of dozens of bike stands located through out the downtown. Return the bicycle to another stand within 30 minutes and you avoid further charges. Exceed the 30 minutes and they charge you an ever increasing surcharge. ($ 2 for 31 to 60 minutes, 4 or 6$ if you exceed 1 hour, etc.) While it was a bit of a hassle finding a bicycle station at times that was a small price to pay to avoid additional blisters on my feet. Bicycling is the only way to get around the city.\n",

(Where A Bike At?) is a free app that can point you to the nearest station with availibility. We purchased a 3 day pass for $15. There are usage fees if you keep the bike for more than 30 minutes but its very easy to avoid this charge by checking the bike in at the nearest stand every 30 minutes. Usage fees start at $2 an hour. Still a deal IMO. I suggest renting a bike at night to tour all the Monuments while they are lit up at night. This is a great experience minus the crowds.\n",

      "So I was standing on the Mall near the Washington Monument with sore shins and feet from walking so much. I wanted to get to the Lincoln Memorial, but was dreading the walk. Then I see a row of similar bikes on locked racks. I see that I can sign up for 24-hour period for $7 and use a bike for free (no usage fee) for up to 30 minutes (30 - 60 add $2, 60 - 90 add $6). So I grabbed a bike and leisurely rode down the mall to the Lincoln Memorial, stopping at the WWII and Vietnam memorials. I returned the bike to the closest rack and moved on.After that I grabbed another bike off the same rack, looked at the map of rack locations all around the mall AND Washington DC, made my plan of where to go to next, then proceeded to tour the rest of the mall area. No walking needed.This service is fantastic. I saw MANY people using it and it makes perfect sense! No wasting time walking between distant attractions.By the way, the bikes are HEAVY three speed units not meant for any kind of speed. They are intended for leisurely use.\n",

      "Tough finding docking stations without a Smart phone\n",
      "My wife and I made our first visit to D.C. the weekend following Labor Day for half a week and used Capital Bikeshare one day to get from our hotel at Dupont Circle to the National Mall. From the Mall, we headed off on the bikes to a lunch venue, then back to some Smithsonian museums, then around the Mall some more, and finally to a Metro station to head back to the hotel.The directions at each station are clear cut. Rental for the day is $7. Rental for 3 days is $15. You've got the use of the bikes for a 24 hour period if you rent for the day like we did. Every 30 minutes you must re-dock your bike at another station if you want to avoid additional fees, $2 for the next 30 minutes (31-60 minutes), $4 more dollars for the next 30 minutes (61-90) minutes. Payment options are credit or debit only. After docking your bike for the first time and ready to check another one out for another 30 minutes, you simply re-scan your credit/debit card at the pay station and follow the directions to retrieve your unlock code which is valid for 5 minutes. You don't get dinged each time you slide your card.You can dock a bike at a station and immediately check another one out too. There are docking stations all over the place, but a few times we couldn't find a station that was indicated on the online or station map, and many times we passed by stations that weren't on the maps at all. When I speak of these maps, I'm talking about the website and the ones at the pay/docking stations. There are no hard copy maps available. Since we don't have phones with internet capabilities, we felt lost on more than one occasion searching for another docking station. Reading other reviews, it sounds like their app is very helpful. However, we were always able to find another station within the allotted 30 minutes. A 45 minute allotment of time would be much better and leave the rider feeling much less rushed. If planning on using them to tour the memorials at the National Mall, you'll be very rushed or will have to skip stuff, dock the bike, and backtrack on foot. There's a station by the Washington Monument, one by the Jefferson Memorial, and one by the Lincoln Memorial on the west side of the mall where all of the memorials are.My wife had trouble with her seat staying put on a couple of occasions so make sure you grab a bike that has a seat that locks down tight. After sunset, we rode around the National Mall to see everything again, and that was great. The flashing LED headlights don't provide a ton of light however. The lights, I believe, are mostly there as a safety measure for you to be seen by others. There are other bike rental companies in town that offer usage for the entire day if that's what you're looking for. My wife used similar bikes in Boulder, CO earlier this year and had a bit friendlier experience than here in D.C. We'd certainly try these again, but would make sure we upgraded to a smart phone next time to make life considerably easier.\n",

      "Whoever came up with this idea is simply genius! Great way to get around the city, we had a bus tour and used these for the 2 days we were in town and it worked a treat. so much faster than walking and the breeze is nice too. I would recommend downloading the app so you can get live updates on how many bikes are at each station and where the closest station is. The app also has a rental timer to help return the bike within 30 mins to avoid rental charges.READ THE BOARD BEFORE RENTING!!! I have read a few reviews on here of people getting confused with the pricing and thinking they could keep the bike for the whole day for $7. It is not hard to understand and my husband and I found it very clear in the fact that the rental was $7 for 24 hours and during that 24 hrs if you returned bike within 30 mins it was free, and then it had the charges for if you returned after the 30 mins. simple! there are so many bike stations around that it was so easy to re dock the bikes within the 30 mins period, we never went over our time period and were not inconvenienced by having to re dock the bikes. Occasionaly we docked and re docked straight away to avoid charges if we were planning on riding a bit further.\n",

      "We have used these very accessible modes of transportation to enhance our sightseeing experience in the downtown and extended areas of DC. My husband discovered this unique, cost effective, \"enjoy at your own pace\" way to travel around the city during the busy Inauguration and again when we visited the city in the Spring! We were able to go places and experience sights that we would not have seen from a car. It was a totally amazing riding directly down the center of Pennsylvania Avenue, from the White House to Capitol Hill, since they had removed the traffic lights in preparation for the Inauguration. We explored the National Mall and Smithsonian Museums, the Washington Monument, Reflecting Pool, Lincoln Memorial, around the Tidal Basin with its many meaningful monuments, to the Jefferson Memorial. In the Spring, we explored the Arlington National Cemetery. It is easy to use the pick-up and drop-off kiosks, with many stations a short distance from one another. The bikes have three speeds and are simple to maneuver. I highly recommend giving this a try, because I am not a cyclist and had so much fun each time.\n",

      "A good way to get around - but don't expect to find a bike every time.\n",
      "First off: hats off to any city that's doing its bit to promote this kind of transport system. Washington's heart is certainly in the right place. $7 for a day of travel around the sights of the National Mall and further afield to Arlington and Georgetown is certainly good value. To clarify: you have 30 minute window to get your bike docked into another station, not the 90 as one review has it, though you do get a 'safety' 15 minutes if you find all of the stations full when you reach your destination. Given that the metro is $2.70 a ride (when including the paper card) you can save yourself some money and sore feet with the bike.The bikes are simply and easy to ride, and you can get a reasonable shunt going if you're so inclined, though I'm not sure why you'd want to unless you're a DC commuter heading into work, and then why are you reading this?Here's the health warning: there are lots of tourists and bikes can become a premium in certain places (the Lincoln Memorial for example) so you can't expect to rock up and find one. The app is good, but doesn't update strictly in real time: by the time you reach the station the bikes might be gone. Some people are quite canny at dropping a bike then swiping for another 30 minutes, so pairs of bikes are sometimes hard to come by.Personally, I wouldn't plan a day around using a bike, especially if you have are under time pressure to get back somewhere, but if you can afford to be a bit more relaxed this might be a fun, and useful, bonus attraction.\n",

Please pay attention to their fees though. I saw that some people who reviewed them on tripadvisor were not aware of the way they charge, so they ended up paying way more than they thought. This is more of a form of transportation from one place to another, not a way to tour around the city for the day. It is $7 for the day and you can have each bike for 1/2 hour at a time.

      "We spent most of the day using the Bikeshare and had such a good time. You collect the bike at a station for $7 for a day and that's all it costs unless you return the bike late. Every 30 mins you need to find another 'bike station' to leave the bike at, go and walk around in that area, then go back to the bike station and take another one. You must return the bike every 30 mins or you will be charged an additional $2 or an additional $6 if you return within an hour. It was a great way to get around quickly as Washington is a big place, but trying to find a bus station became an issue a few times. We didn't have a map as we didn't have access to a computer, so we had to stop and ask a few times. Beware that 30 mins on the bike goes very fast and you may find yourself a long way away from another 'station'. Having a map should stop that from happening. The whole day cost us $9 each which was a huge saving compared with the hop on hop off bus etc. Would recommend this.\n",

Go explore, walk around, take some pictures, visit a museum, eat and then get on a bike again (maybe even the same bike you left few minutes ago :) and bike for up to 30 minutes to your next destination.\n",

      "We liked the bikeshare program. I just wish there were more stations to rent/return the bikes.The program is really simple. $15 gets you a 3-day membership and there is no charge if you return the bike within 30 minutes. Just $2 if you keep it for an extra 30 minutes.My son is 11 and he could ride the bikes with no problem. The national mall is all bike-friendly. The bike lane down Pennsylvania Avenue is well worth it. You are riding right in the CENTER of the road but the cars aren't in your way. Sounds weird, but it really works nice. Take a bike ride from the Capitol to the White House. Just wish there were more stations near the Capitol itself.I'd highly recommend using bikes to get around DC. Your feet will thank you.\n",

      "This service was FABULOUS! We wanted to do the bike thing at our leisure and didn't want to be committed to opening hours for a bike rental shop. Capital Bikeshare has an option for one day membership and the rates were reasonable. There are stations everywhere - and with their iPhone app you can check to see where bikes are available and where return points are. Note that I emailed Capital Bikeshare to get information not covered on their website FAQ and no one ever got back to me - but in the end we didn't need the info anyway.We chose to do a night ride through the mall. The bikes had lights that were suitable given the lighting available in the surrounding - but you might want to bring a flashlight or headlight if you choose to do a night ride. We kept the bikes longer than we expected - but the rate was no different than had we rented from a shop but we had flexibility. A note to one-day renters. You can get 2 bikes with one credit card - but if you need more than 2 bikes you need a DIFFERENT credit card and they only take Mastercard and Visa. Also - the bike security hold fee stayed on both my credit cards for about 5 days (I know this is not in Capital Bikeshare's control - but worth noting). The bikes have little baskets with a bungee that hold items fairly securely. The bikes are utilitarian and not meant for a comfy beach cruise or a cross-country tour - so be prepared for a hard ride. The bikes were in great shape and easily adjustable to our different heights.Note that if you do a mall ride at night - the mall can be quite busy even at night. We found that people were shocked to see bikes near the monuments and some thought it was a great idea and others told us that people should only walk to the monuments (and no we weren't pulling jumps off of Lincoln or anything like that, and we walked the bikes when we got to the monuments) - in any case the bikes seemed to garner a lot of attention.This was my husband's favourite part of our trip.And remember your helmet!\n",

      "Capital Bikeshare is a wonderful addition to DC. The service is affordable and accessible. The bikes can be picked up and returned almost anywhere in central DC. I rented a bike several times over the days I was in DC and rode from my hotel to the National Gallery, to the mall, and to the Lincoln Memorial at night. DC is an easy city to navigate by bike. It's mostly flat. Yet on foot, the distances between museums and monuments can feel long and tiring. The bikes from Capital Bikeshare are perfect. If you're at all inclined to ride bikes, look for Capital Bikeshare next time you're in DC.\n",

      "We had so much fun riding the bikes from monument to monuments. It's definitely a time saver, and not only that, riding at your own pace means we could enjoy the sights and cover all the things we wanted to see. The bikes are easy to rent, just use your credit card, and it's so convenient to dock the bikes for return. We rode on footpaths, through the gardens and went from the White House to the Washington Monument, up the Reflecting Pool to the Lincoln Memorial, then along the river to Jefferson Memorial before heading to Capitol Hill. We docked the bikes outside the Smithsonian Castle then made our way by foot to the see the Natural History museum. Weather was bit cool and it started to snow during the afternoon but what a blast we had! Bikes felt very safe and it's very easy to ride with a few simple gears that you can change to help you ride up or downhill. No helmets provided and it's one of the rare chances you take to feel the wind in your hair!\n",

      "Due to a Metro delay, I found myself running very late to meet friends for dinner. Not wanting to spring for a cab (and realizing that it would not be any faster than walking, due to rush-hour traffic), I decided to give Bikeshare a try. Amazingly, you can join right at the kiosk if you want a 1-day or 3-day membership. I got to dinner on time -- there was a drop-off pod a block from the restaurant -- and got a little exercise, too. I liked it so much I used it again later that night to get back across town when I wasn't near a Metro stop, and then again the following day to get down the National Mall when I decided the weather was too hot to walk so far in direct sun. Each time I easily found nearby bike pods using the Spotcycle iPhone app, and there was always at least a couple of bikes waiting for me in my preferred pickup spot, and plenty of return spaces near my destination (although you get an extra 15 minutes free if you try to return to a pod that's full).Your membership gets you free rides up to 30 minutes in length, with increasing hour rates the longer you keep the bike. (I took a total of 5 rides and none of them were longer than 30 minutes, so I paid only the $7 daily fee.) Then, each time you use the same credit card, the systems recognize you as an existing member.Riding on the street in rush-hour is not for the fainthearted, although you're allowed to ride on the sidewalk outside of the downtown core, and a few dedicated \"bike boulevards\" on major streets (there are maps online of both). I wish we had bikeshare in my city -- it's a great way to get around this mostly-flat city.\n",

      "THEIR BIKES ARE A SAFETY HAZARD\n",
      "City bikes is a very convenient service, they're located all over the DC metro area and have countless stations, where most of the time you can get a bike without too much hassle. The price increased somewhat since my last visit, and at $7 for a day plus charges for trips exceeding 30 mins (when their bicycles are really slow) is a bit steep. Visibility on the little LCD displays where you pay and get a code so you can unlock your bicycle is marginal at best, and under direct sunlight almost impossible to read.That being said, their bicycles are HORRIBLE. They have 3 speeds: slow, slower and barely moving, and steering is severely impaired. This makes for a very unsafe bicycle when you're moving in the middle of traffic. I don't know the statistics, but am almost surprised I didn't get into an accident while riding their clunker through DC streets. And I'm basically a bike commuter, not an athlete or a messenger. Keep that in mind if you decide to use the service.\n",

You can rent and return as much as you want, you just have to limit each ride to 30 minutes or you incur an additional charge. The Spotcycle app is a must!

There are so many great sights in DC that you almost want to walk...but then that's a bit slow. So, put your credit card, in one of the hundred or so Capital Bikeshare stations, follow the instructions, and for a mere $7/day, you can bike the city. Pick up a bike in one spot and drop it off in another. To make it ever easier, be sure to download the the Spotcycle iPhone App so you know where the bike stations are, and even if there are bikes there at that moment.\n",

I have been in the DMV area for less than a year & we currently do not own our own bikes, so we saw that Capital Bikeshare had the most docks & that the website actually shows you how many are available at each dock. What the website does not tell you--which I can is being misleading--is the fact that it's $7 for the first 30 mins, but there are additional fees for the extra time & there is a $101 deposit per bike...for us, it wasn't a big deal...we originally planned to go from 10th & constitution to Georgetown, but after we saw the price, we decided to change our ride to around the national mall & see the MLK memorial. We never had intentions on biking all day, so the 1.5 hours was perfect for us & still an inexpensive, fun way to tour DC. Definitely not meant for long rides.

We were exhausted from walking and in a sketchy part of town at night, trying to quickly access a bike and didn’t realize what we agreed to. We rode to the Lincoln memorial, parked, walked 5 steps away and took a picture and someone rode off on our bikes. On the scooters (that we used all day but we’re dead at this time) they had GPS’s and you can end your ride immediately if someone takes off on it. We didn’t realize the bikes weren’t like that (first time using it) and were devastated when they were gone, and read the “you’re responsible for up to $1200 if bike is not returned” part. Called customer service immediately and the nice lady reassured me if whoever stole them returned them, she would waive the fee. Well, the man I talked to today said he would not be able to do that and was super rude and said “well I could get my manager to review it but we don’t normally waive fees.. but like at least they returned the bike”... yes we’re SUPER grateful they returned the bikes... but it was 14hrs later (have to turn them in every 30min for no overage charges) so we were charged $94 each for a BIKE that we rode for maybe 20 minutes because we “abandoned it”... at the time I was frustrated because he was making it seem like I was lying to him about the lady saying she would waive the fee, so I said forget it because he was SO rude. It was a good 20 minutes while it lasted but if you’re in DC don’t you dare get off that bike at ALL for anything at all or you’ll be charged out the butt for a bike that isn’t even worth that much money. Rent a scooter, it’s cheaper in the long run and has a GPS. The lady in customer service was awesome, but the man who I spoke to today should not be in customer service at all. Such a shame because we enjoyed the bikes but we will not touch one again due to this awful experience. Find a different bike service. Get a scooter. Anything other than being possibly responsible for a $1200 charge for a freakin bicycle.'},\n",

You will find docks of bikes throughout Washington and with a little patience you will be on one or two of these bikes to explore the city. My only grief was trying to get up and running as that process is far from intuitive. After downloading the app, selecting your bike, I confess it was not clear at first where one enters the code generated by the app to release the bike. Once we got that ironed out, we remained mindful that we only had 30 minutes to get them back to one of the docks, which we did but there was more confusion on our part on how to successfully lock them back up. Thankfully, I had a 13 year old in my company who diagnosed that problem but again, none of this is intuitive. The key is sorting all of that out in advance AND knowing how long you need the bike for. If 30 minutes puts too much pressure on you, I would opt for the longer periods as the increase in rental rate is not that cost prohibitive - it sounds like it is costly otherwise if you poorly estimate how much time you need.'},\n",

I came here to leave a review and was shocked at how awful some of the reviews are. I had such a positive experience.The first place we stopped to rent bikes had a line, and only a few bikes, so we kept walking. About a half mile later, we found another rental spot with lots of bikes and nobody waiting.I did find the cost explanation posted to be very confusing. It was also not easy to read the tiny screen in the bright sun. But in the end, we got it figured out, and rented two bikes. My credit card was immediately charged $4 for two bikes for the first half hour. Let me tell you, the mall is huge. So riding down the sidewalk to the Lincoln Memorial was the best way to travel. We saved so much time! And it was so much fun! I haven't been on a bike for 15 years, and it's true what they say. You never forget how to ride a bike.The only drawback was the fact that there were so many people everywhere. It was hard to ride in that area, because of course, pedestrians have the right of way. The bikes had little bells to warn people you were passing, but most people really weren't paying attention to that. We kept our bikes a bit over the 30 minute limit, and when we docked them near the White House (I found docking locations on google maps) we were charged an additional $4 for the next half hour. Still, $8 for two bikes for 45 minutes was well worth it!I did have a little trouble docking my bike. I kept slamming it into the docking station, but never got the green light. My nephew had a softer touch, and he pushed it just a little bit tighter, and got the green. I liked having that reassurance that the bike was officially returned. I also liked that the docking station had a place to indicate if the bike had any problems associated with it, so it would be checked before being rented out again. I would absolutely get one of these bikes again, but perhaps during a less crowded time of year. I would also recommend the powers-that-be try to simplify the cost structure. It was too confusing.\"},\n",

The entire trip was about 3 hours and we would have kept going except it began raining. Once in the car I got the texts the company sends saying the bikes are docked but I didn't realize until we were back at our hotel in bed that only 3 of the 4 bikes had docked. I called the company and the suggestion I go back to the docking station at 2 am to redock it was laughable. I explained that was impossible since it was the middle of the night, kids are asleep and it's raining out and I knew the darn thing locked in since we tried pulling them out when we docked to make sure they were locked in. They sent someone the next morning and I got a text at 6am the bike docked. I then called them and they took the charge off my Credit Card. Good customer service but having worked for attorneys I knew worse case scenario I could and would dispute the charge and force them to waste the money taking me to court of need be.

As others have already said: be sure you understand the pricing structure. Other bikes in the area such as LimeBike can be a bit more convenient (the LimeBike I used came with a phone mount for using maps!) but they aren’t necessarily together in one place, so harder for a family or group to find and use. Also, beware if you’re on a schedule: if a docking station is full, they’ll give you an extra 15 minutes to take the bike to another docking station, so long as you request it from the full docking station. Not a big deal for a tourist but if you’re on a time schedule that could be a big hassle.

If bike is not exchanged within the 30 minutes, additional charges apply.

Easy enough though, just set a timer for 25 minutes and when it goes off, just find a docking station, dock your bike and start the process all over again. The only real downsides are that the docking ports aren’t always where you might want them to be and bikes are not always available. So using the app is of prime importance. Also check out Mobike, another great service where you just ride it somewhere and leave it. Bring your own helmet for none of these services provide them'},\n",

We saw people riding the bikes in town and thought it would be a great way to get around. We did enjoy our experience, but not the fees. They are intentionally unclear. Due to this ambiguity, we misunderstood the daily membership concept from the kiosks and therefore were charged $88 for using two bikes two times (roughly 2.5 hours and 1.5 hours) After calling to inquire about the fees, we now understand that it is $8 for as many trips up to 30 minute over the 24-hour period. Keeping it past 30 minutes costs additional fees, and these fees grow expedentially. The inquiry call did result in some money being credited back. The bike themselves were comfortable and had 3 speeds. We were were visiting the monuments and didn't find the station near the Jefferson memorial. (We were going off our memory from the kiosk by the Washington monument; perhaps the app would have helped.). When we got to Lincoln there were only 2 bikes in the kiosks and we consciously didn't turn in our bikes because we were afraid none would be there when we were ready to leave. If we had understood the concept, we could have checked them back in and then immediately checked them back out.I believe the cost structure is intentionally deceptive and therefore only give them 1 star. However, riding was fun and the metro involves a lot of walking to see all the monuments, so I hope they become more transparent and honest and that they offer a true daily rate.\"},\n",

My recommendation :1- install the app, and always make sure that at least 2 empty docks are free at the desired destination 2- plan 24minute trips, so whatever goes on your way, you will not exceed the 30 min threshold.finally i think this is a convenient way to commute since there are docks/ bikes all over the Washington DC and Virginia., and you do not need to worry to park your precious bike on roads, carry it on buses and metros. or leaving it in unsafe places.Hope this was beneficial'},\n",

I called the Bikesare billing office and was told that I needed to return the bike to a station every 30 minutes in order to be charged $8 for the day. This was not clear to us when we rented the bikes. The web page is very deceiving about touring for a day. I was told bu the office that these bikes are for commuters not touring.

You will use same credit card throughout the day to receive a code to unlock your bikes. The most you can link to one card will be two bikes. So if you have a family of 4, you will need two cards. Not a big deal, but can be inconvenient. We did the 24 hour pass for 8 bucks each. Basically, you unlock your bike and you have 30 min to drop off at another bike station. You can literally just drop it off, swipe for another code and check it back out. I don't see why you would wanna keep it out for more since you stop at a museum or memorial and walk around, who would wanna walk around with their bike? The stations are located all over the memorials and cities. I downloaded the app and could click on a station to see if there was docking available and or bikes, and this also gives you a way to plan out your day to see everything. The app is updated in real time. If you happen to get to a station with no docks available, you can request a grace period to find another station. Also when you check your bike in, just make sure the light turns green to know you checked it in correctly. They will also send you a text message. I absolutely loved it, there's no way we would have been able to see all the sights at the mall without this. We didnt miss our 30 min deadline once, so all day it was just $16 for both of us! If i had to do it again, I would have chose to go on a weekday for less crowds, easier to ride. \"},\n",

All 3 bikes received a green light to indicate the bike was properly docked. I also received (2) texts. Here is where I messed up. I though that meant the (2) RECEIPTS were successful. However, it actually was each bike, meaning (1) of the bikes was not successfully docked even thought we got a green light. About 30 minutes later I received a text that we were being charged additional fees for being over the 30 minutes. I called and spoke with a gentleman who asked if we were near the bikes. We were not. He said he would send someone to dock the bike. He was very pleasant. This put a damper on our time as we knew \"I Agree\" to the $1200.00 cost of the bike if anything were to happen to it. It was quite the bummer on our trip. About 45 minutes later we received a text that the bike was successfully docked. OMG was I so relieved. The cost of the bikes should have been $6.00 for 3 bikes, but I was charged $2.00 on the one credit card and $4.00 TWICE on the other credit card. Seems others have been overcharged much more so I did not call to dispute the charge. Although it does seem like they make their money by overcharges.The charges do seem confusing on the website and from other reviewers as you can take the bikes out for longer time periods, but it is a small extra charge per 1/2 hour.

We literally had the bikes for 10 minutes -- just enough time to ride to the bottom of the hill and dock them at Arlington Mill Road -- less than a mile away. This was only my second time renting from Capital Bikeshare and I didn't re-dock the bikes properly. I happened to check my bank account on July 22 about midday and noticed a charge of $62 in addition to the $4.00 rental charge from Capital Bikeshare. I called and spoke with two different representatives who explained that one bike was returned five hours later to a station on Four Mile Run and the other had not yet been returned and was still accusing charges. Maurice said they could authorize a one-time courtesy reimbursement of half of the charges -- which could not be finalized until the other bike was returned. I drove down two the Arlington Mill station and located the bike that was parked but not properly docked. I locked it into place and called back to speak with a supervisor. After calling back several hours later, I was told a supervisor would contact me at 11 pm. Irene did call me but said exactly the same. It was my fault for not docking the bike properly, the instructions are clearly printed on the kiosk, and she could only authorize half of the charges refunded. I said I found that outrageous as an annual pass costs less that my total charges -- which amounted to $157.00. I could have purchased a day pass, a three-day pass, or an annual pass for less. I asked to speak with someone above her and was told there was no one. I called back later and asked another representative, Cynthia, for the name of Irene's supervisor. She said Ashley and Irene are the only two supervisors; there is no one above them. I find it extraordinary that a business can blindly rob people, legally. Capital Bike Share is BANKING on novice users to make a docking mistake so they can profit. If they cared about the customer, they would notify customers via text when their time is near expiring -- that would be GOOD business. I never received any notification that the bikes had not been docked properly -- even though that is a question addressed on their FAQ page. If I hadn't checked my back account, that bike would still be accruing charges. I am just asking for a little kindness and compassion. I understand that I made an unfortunate mistake, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Give me an annual pass OR reduce the rate to $25, and IMPLEMENT A NOTIFICATION SYSTEM to customers! I will make sure every online reviewer hears this story and I will never rent from a this company again -- absolutely no humanity!\"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': \"My friends and I loved riding these bikes around DC. We were in from out of town and enjoyed getting the exercise and the adventure of finding the bikes at the different docks and heading down from Adams Morgan to the mall. We happily and smugly rode around the enormous mall and covered so much more territory than we ever could have on foot. We stopped and ate at a fun restaurant, parked (not docked) our bikes and fully enjoyed our day... until ...the next day my friend checked her credit card and we got the sticker shock. Two bikes -- $108 for 4 hours of riding! And we signed up for $8 (x2=$16) for 24 hours. What the heck? WE HAD NO IDEA THAT WE HAD TO DOCK THE BIKES EVERY 30 MINUTES AND TAKE THEM OUT AGAIN IN ORDER TO KEEP THE CHARGE AT $8. Had we read Tripadvisor's bad reviews we would have known. Too many people have had this happen to them. Bikeshare refunded half, and their customer service was able to explain clearly on the phone that this is the procedure, but nowhere in the written verbiage does it indicate this odd procedure. The procedure makes sense if one thinks about the bikeshare being a commuter service first, but tourists need better information about this funny check-in, check-out thing. I had checked out the website to see how it worked beforehand, and $8 for 24 hours seemed simple enough. The grid of pricing shows upcharges for time ranges, but the overriding message was $8 for 24 hours and so the upcharges felt like they belonged to a different category. I am disappointed that such a great idea and well executed system cannot simply add this language to their website or FAQs. I have no doubt that tourists like me might have chosen to pay some upcharge for the convenience of having them out for longer, OR we would have enjoyed the challenge of finding docks every 30 minutes like a treasure hunt. I would guess that the 25% of 1 star reviews (at this writing) would be 4's or 5's if they would fix this problem of understanding. AND I think Bikeshare would earn their upcharges with knowing consumers rather than getting the upcharges from consumers who end up feeling deceived. Just so unnecessary. PLEASE note the procedure and the upcharges if you go past 30 minutes without docking, and THEN have a great ride!\"},\n",

That said, 24hrs for $8; can\\'t beat it, right?! Well, that is definitely not the case and judging from the numerous negative reviews read since receiving an additional $76 charge two days post-docking our bikes for good, we are not the only wrongly informed consumers who have been charged outrageous prices unknowingly. After seeing the additional $76 dollar charge, I typed an email to \"Capital Bikeshare\" inquiring (I will update this review when I hear back) about the charge. I also looked through all of their \"FAQ\\'s\" and \"Help\" portions of their website; however, nothing touched upon this topic. I was extremely concerned, so I went to the ever trusting \"tripadvisor\" for help and learned that Capital Bikeshare does not have a great reputation with consumers and their misleading prices have affected many travelers pocketbooks! \"Capital Bikeshare\" really needs to be upfront and honest regarding their costs and additional charges, and even if these extra charges are listed in the fine print (I have not read this yet), my personal opinion is that they need to make it more visible /noticeable at each docking station, as I have gathered that most often \"Capital Bikeshare\" is a spur of the moment type of purchase; it was for us anyway, and the only rates we noticed were the very low-cost prices front and center and no warning of extreme additional charges. Through my readings on tripadvisor, I noticed that one reviewer stated when she called Capital Bikeshare, they told her that the $8 pass is for 24hrs, but it only covers the first 30 minutes. If you do not want to be charged, you must check in every 30 minutes at a docking station. This to me is complete trickery of Capital Bikeshare. It also creates an inconvenience for the customer, as there are very few docking stations around and I didn\\'t notice a single one near the memorial district, which is largely the area traveled with the bikes. All in all, I will NEVER use Capital Bikeshare again; they are a rip off company!'},\n",

Years ago when I first got to DC, getting around was a hassle, but with Capital Bikeshare, I could explore more on bike during my 2nd time back in DC. With so many bike docks throughout the city, it's usually not a problem finding an available bike unless you are around super-popular point like Lincoln Memorial.If you have at least a day pass, you can use the bike as many times as you want without extra charge as long as you ride for less than 30 minutes each time. Just make sure if you dock your bike properly (wait for the light to turn green) after you're done or else you'll be charged after 30 minutes! Use the Metro or rideshare to cover the extreme distances, but if you are traversing medium to short distance especially throughout the National Mall, I highly recommend using Capital Bikeshare!\"},\n",

They only allow you to rent 2 bikes at a time and we needed 3 and put them on 2 different cards. They do hold an amount on your credit card (about $100-$150 for each bike). You can return them to any station throughout the city, however, there needs to be an empty space to put it in. This might be difficult sometimes. They don\\'t provide helmets. In the city, you have to ride on the street and there are no bike lanes (not ideal for kids).

I can only assume based on this experience that maybe they don\\'t upkeep the equipment well enough. Okay, so bad first impression, but once i finally got a bike, it obviously worked fine as a bike should. No flats, no issues, no problems.The second time I rented a bike, it was for a \"24 hour\" period of time, quoted at \"$8\" for the entire period. Now comes the fun part... a few days later i was charged an additional $94!!Apparently, you are supposed to dock the bike every 30 minutes or else you will be charged outrageous amounts for the time (that you supposedly already paid for). This is not disclosed in an obvious location or anywhere in the prompting on the tiny screen in front of you. This is only noted in the extremely long and arduous to read \"Terms & Conditions\" (which by the way is about 156 pages or so, and would take hours to read on the tiny screen provided for you)I immediately called Capital Bikeshare to dispute this charge and see if they would give me a one time waive, considering I did not damage the bike and followed what I had believed were the appropriate procedures. I spoke with 1 lady, Lawanda, who was a smart-alec and not helpful... She was only offering a 50% reduction of my fee and was trying to help get management (UNACCEPTABLE). Unfortunately I had to hang-up for another call coming in. I then had to call back and spoke with Brandy, who could not get her phone off of speaker or was having some kind of feedback loop issue with the audio. That may not have been her fault, but regardless, not helping my frustrations. At this point I am incredibly fed up and disgusted with this company.

This is hinged on you docking your bike at a bike station every 30 minutes. If you accomplish this there will be no additional fees on your credit card. However, if you do what my son-in-law did earlier in the week and not dock the bike the cost adds up fast.

       "  'Entry_Content': \"My boyfriend and I visited DC for the first time this month to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. Being our first time and looking to keep it as a budget friendly trip, we were a bit nervous about how to navigate the city without spending a fortune on Taxi's or Ubers.Capital Bikeshare was our saving grace. I looked into hop on/hop off tours, bike rentals, segway tours...you name it, but they all came with hefty price tags.Bike Rentals were min $20pp per day. Capital Bikeshare has a 3 days Membership for $17pp. This allowed us to have unlimited trips for free for 30 minutes a trip.This allowed us to visit all of the monuments, museums and even bike the city a bit without any worries and saved us so much time. It was also SUPER hot and we were so thankful we had a bike to get us from point a to point b so quickly rather than spending more time in the humid hot sun.The APP is a MUST!!!! I used this APP all weekend not only for bike locations, but as a general GPS - lol. It was great being able to see where we were AND if there was bikes near by if we wanted to grab one.As highly as I recommend this to anyone visiting DC and how I will look into these services in any other city I visit, there is a slight downside which is why I scored them a 4/5 instead of a perfect 5.The downside is hoping to gosh the location you're going to either A) has bikes or B) has open spots for you to dock the bike. The app tells you how many bikes are available and how many open ports there are and is pretty real time, but it is not completely accurate, especially in the really busy locations. In the super busy locations like near the Lincoln Memorial, they truly need MORE bikes. We had a bike that took us there, docked it, and 20 minutes later when we wanted to move on, there were no bikes at the 2 closest locations. We probably spent a good 40 minutes between both stations waiting for a bike. At one point, we saw 3 bikes available, and in the 5 minutes it took us to walk across the street, they were gone. So then I saw that another station a few blocks away had 9 bikes. While we were walking there I saw it go down to 7, then 6, then 4..only for us to show up as a family was booking the last 4 bikes. This happened to us another time where we saw 4 bikes at a location and by the time we got there only 1 was left. And one time we got back to the station near our hotel and it was full so we had to ride 4 blocks away to dock it. Another couple was with us who didn't have the app. They were going to ride to the closest location which also didn't have any available docks so they followed us to the next one. While this didn't deter us from using it, we know it's just due to it being so popular and such a good option to get around the city, I just wish they had more stations, closer together incase of no docks or no bikes, and more bikes!\"},\n",

Cost looks fair. It only becomes an issue if you are over an hour on any one journey. Ours would be easily under. The problem arrives when you want to drop off. The Mall stations were nearly full, though we managed. Georgetown was completely full. There are 4 stations and we visited them all. Only 1 slot was available. That makes a mockery of the system.

Essentially, I did a self-led monument tour on bike, using the Capital Bikeshare program. It was really easy. I opted for the three day membership (I think this option was around 20 bucks) and then biked my heart out. So here is the deal, you get 30 minutes of each ride free. I downloaded one of the apps (I used D.C. Bikes) that shows you where all of the stations are. This handy app also has a timer that helps you remember when 30 minutes is almost up. So, when the timer hit 5 minutes or so, I looked for the closest station (using the app), docked the bike to return it, and then got another bike. If you make sure to return the bike before your free 30 minutes is up, you bike all over town for just the cost of the membership. A couple more pointers.. pick out your bike, adjust the seat, and know where you are going before you swipe your card. That way, you are ready to go and are not wasting time with all this while the clock is ticking. The bikes are a little heavy, but they get you where you are going. Happy biking!'},\n",

Bottom line: It was great breezing around town on the cruiser; however, I wouldn't do it again unless traveling alone. If you must rent these bikes, carefully dock the bike after use; wait for the GREEN light before you leave; don't wait until the last second to swap bikes and if you do follow the instructions to get your 15 minute credit.

The worst thing was the treatment recieved by the people from customer service, who are supposed to help the customers but instesd of doing that they just keep insisting that I was crazy and that both codes were ok and that i should find the other bike (by a bar code thet have sticked on them) and but it back!

Any regular European would expect the rental to be around $8 for a day, for 1 bike. That seems like a fair and normal charge, right? Would you investigate further and could you ever conceive of being charged $172 on top of the regular rental? Well, watch out, because they can simply slap it on your creditcard. Just like that... So here is where it went wrong for us. We did not understand that we had to dock the bike every 30 minutes. A simple misunderstanding that Capital Bikeshare takes full advantage of. We could have easily docked the bikes, because we used the bike to visit all the tourist sights. However, we were totally unaware that this needed to be done in order to get honored the $8 a day fee. And so, upon leaving Washington, we were presented with a $172 fee. Capital Bikeshare explained us the reasoning behind it, and we explained to them that if we had known of their rules, we would have docked the bikes accordingly. Cut a long story short, they were \"kind\" enough to refund $86. That still left me feeling totally robbed by them though. Will never use them again, and strongly recommend to rent elsewhere, for a day rental. Make sure to research other rental companies, because this one takes full advantage of you not knowing the full rules.'},\n",

My boyfriend and I took two bikes from the Jefferson Drive station - nearest the Washington Monument, and proceeded on a clockwise tour around the Tidal Basin taking in the Jefferson Memorial, George Mason Memorial, Tidal Basin sights and Cherry Trees, FDR Memorial, MLK Memorial, DC War Memorial, Lincoln Memorial, Reflecting Pool, Vietnam Memorial, 56 Signers of the Declaration and pool, the WWII Memorial, the White House, finally and Capitol Hill before riding our bikes back down the Hill past the Smithsonians and returning our bikes, ultimately back to the same original station on Jefferson Drive. Aggravatingly, between all those sights, there is only one station over between the FDR memorial and Lincoln memorial to park the bikes again and reset the 30 min free window of time. This makes it impossible to pay the $8 for a daily pass and maintain a free charge by staying under 30 mins, as there is simply not enough bike stations to check your bike back in, not to mention you'll find yourself easily spending at least 30 mins or more at each memorial if you really take your time to relax and take in the feeling of each sight. In the end, we were charged much more than we expected, but after doing the math it was the correct charge as advertised. In hind sight, I would do it again as riding the bikes sure did beat walking, (there is no way possible to cover that much ground on foot and not want to kill each other from exhaustion and aching feet), feeling the wind as you bike along, and laughing the whole way riding along made the entire experience on the Mall so much more enjoyable. Just be prepared to spend about $50 a person so you won't feel suckered when you see the charges appear on your card.\"},\n",

It allowed us to see all of the sights, more than once, without having to walk everywhere or take other transit. I see some people complaining about the lack of docking stations near the museums, or the cost being high, yet we didn't find either of these to be the case. The key is to read the instructions...you can do so ahead of time online at their website. There is also a free app you can download ahead of time to help you find the docking stations. We found stations near all the places we went (Lincoln memorial, Space museum, capital, our hotel, etc.). To use them the most economically...rent them for 24 hours or 3 days. Then, as long as each time you ride them it's 30 minutes or less until you check it back in to a docking station, there is no charge. So we just got the bike, rode to the next sight we wanted to see, checked the bike in, explored the sight, and then got another bike to ride to the next sight. If you lock it up, then you're going to be paying for all that time that you aren't using it...just find a station, dock it, and get another bike once you're done exploring the memorial or the museum. A couple of times we used the bike over 30 minutes (like when we rode to Arlington Cemetery), and it was just $2 more. THE KEY IS TO CHECK THE BIKE IN, EXPLORE, AND THEN GET ANOTHER BIKE. Our kids loved this, and we did, too. And doing this at night all around the mall to see the beautiful lights was the highlight of our trip. The paths are large, and easy to maneuver on the bikes. And even riding to our hotel or to a restaurant, as long as the sidewalks weren't super crowded, we could just ride on the sidewalks. The bikes have a bell on them, so you can alert walkers that you are approaching. This is the way to go in DC!\"},\n",

The bicycles are in great shape, the kiosks are easy to use, the response time from the kiosks is quick, and the kiosks are located in very convenient locations. I would suggest that bikeshare find a way to let riders tell the system what maintenance needs to be done to each bike ( a missing bell on one, a slipping second gear on another).I was very brave and road up Mass Ave all the way to 15th Street from the very convenient Union Station Bikeshare kiosk. No muss, no fuss. Parked at 21st and M, went for coffee and then picked up a new bike to travel back across town to 7th and F. Capitol Bikeshare has a great website that makes it very easy to find where kiosks are located, if there are slots available at the kiosk of choice, and helps you plan your trips. I think that from now on when I am in DC I will skip the Metro, bus and cabs - I will use Capitol Bikeshare and have freedom from waiting in underground caverns for crowded subway cars, paying for parking in lots, and searching for elusive parking spaces.Next time you are in DC, give Capital Bikeshare a try.

Besides, if you are a tourist, it is always uneasy to find a bike stand (if you do not have mobile with the internet connection with you). It seems that these bike stands are deliberately hidden on the back streets, so you loose time just for looking for them and pay extra. And there are not enough of these stands. You can easily arrive with your bike and find no free slot to park it. Overall impression - Capital Bikeshare wants to earn money on you without thinking about your convenience and safety. In comparison to Vienna city bikes, for example, this provides bad impression. Not a single stand near National Gallery, or Space museum, of Natural History Museum, the most popular places. You have to make circles and circles in order to find a bike stand on the back side of the Orangery (not the most obvious place!) and to walk from there.'},\n",

Do people really think they are getting a bike for $8.00 a day and that is it? It is a membership and if you go over 30 minutes without checking in the bike there will be extra charges.Do keep in mind there will be bike stations that have no bikes or there are no docks. There will be bike that do not work and docks that are broken.You want to make sure if you are riding and pass a bike station to check the bike in,. You can not be sure your destination station will have empty slots. You can get 15 minutes extra time if there is no slots to drop the bike. However you need to know where the next station is. That may also be full. There are maps of the locations at the stations but there is no place at the station that you can check the status. There are apps available for cell phones but they are not that reliable. They are not always up to date or the app does not work. The Capital Bikeshare app it has for itself never worked. Try Spotcycle or others.We had two bikes and rode about 15 miles over the two days and 2 1/2 hours hours of use, It was easy to check in the bike and get the same bike out again. There we a few spots there were no empty slots. What we did if there was only one slot was to check in one bike, get it out again and check in the other bike and get that out again. That we we got another 30 minutes until we could find an open station. One time we had to go to 3 stations before we could return both bikes together. One time we had to check-in and leave one bike and then go drop the the other bike at the coral bike station at 13th and New York Ave then walk backKeep in mind commuters ride the bikes to downtown to work and take them back near their home. We found walking and riding around that most of the bike stations where full around the downtown area and the museums.during the day with people waiting for an empty slot to open up.We used the bike system for 2 days and had a day key card for convenience. We could have got a day membership or 3 day membership but then you have to use a code each time. There is also the question of the deposit charged for each bike. I never got a clear answer from customer service on this. We were not charged a deposit with the day key card.There is also a problem with Capital Bikeshare answering e-mails. They don't respond. Not once did they respond to any e-mails I sent in weeks prior to the trip. I ended up calling most times.. I also brought it to there attention of the negative reviews here and other sites that they should address. They did not seem to care.Still we wanted to give this a try. It worked out fine even with the hassle of finding a open bike station to drop a bike. The bikes are nice and study and easy to use.Give it a try but know how it works!\"},\n",

We started the rental process which is rather cumbersome and takes several minutes per bike. We only wanted to go from the Lincoln Memorial to the Holocaust museum so seemed easy enough. We got two bikes out (clock starts running on rental time as soon as that first leaves the docking station) and discovered the following:- We discovered the hard way that you can only rent TWO bikes per credit card ACCOUNT. Although we had four credit cards between us, we could only rent 4 bikes because they were linked to only two accounts. (our other Visa number was stolen at the start of our trip and that account was shut down). The machine spit out ticket codes and it took quite awhile for us to realize it was simply reissuing the rental code numbers that didn't work. After we gave up and I RAN the entire way in 98 degrees trying to keep up with my kids on their bikes, my husband realized it was just Reissuing the codes that my daughters had already used to release their bikes. By the time we rented the first four bikes, and gave up on the last two, we were probably already 15 minutes into our rental period. When we got to the docking station nearest the Holocaust museum, there weren't enough open slots to dock the four bikes.... so we needed to find another location a few blocks past our destination, return the bikes there, and then come back on foot. (Our kids are 16, 14, 12, & 10.... the 10 year old just barely was able to reach the pedals with the seat lowered all the way. There are no helmets so bring your own)\"},\n",

People should not have to worry about finding a capital bike dock station and worry about getting charged if they don't check-in on time.

Customer service told me they would call me with updates, they never did, I called every hour with minimal updates, had to leave DC not knowing the resolution to the issue. Thankfully bike was returned and they did credit day of rental to me. Although half of my weekend to DC was ruined and their customer service needs significant improvement in how they talk with customers and choice of phrasing in email communications. The right thing to do would have been to let me rent out a 2nd bike so we could have enjoyed the rest of our Sunday. I have since asked around and will use Bike and Roll the next time I return to DC. Never Capital Bikeshare again, not worth it.\"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': 'I’m echoing what others have said, which is that this is kind of a scam. The way the website is laid out seems to be intentionally misleading, stating “Membership and Usage Fees”, with a chart below that clearly shows “24 hour $8”, “3 Day $17”, etc. but you have to scroll down to see that usage fees are listed - and charged - separately. I had the bike for 3 hours and was charged the $8 at the terminal, and then got hit with a $38 charge later on my card. When I called them I was told you have to re-dock the bike every 30 minutes to avoid the fees. We were in DC as tourists and thought the bikes would be a great way to see the memorials, and when we were done we couldn’t find a station with 2 open spots so I had to go a mile out of our way to find somewhere to drop mine. But this was all too bad for me, as the supervisor, Bud, told me. He was clearly unconcerned with my plight and reduced the charge somewhat, but not entirely. In doing some further research I’ve also found that the company has received $16 million in government subsidies as it is supposed to be helping low-income people commute and maintain employment. Good luck with that with the fees they charge! There’s no way anyone on a tight budget could handle these, and the company is clearly looking to make a big, fat profit off anybody who doesn’t read and understand the convoluted rules – while also taking our tax payer dollars. Really, really disappointing.'},\n",

You do need to be mindful of the time, as the cost is $8/ day, then charged by the half hour for use. The first 30 min is free, but if you keep it longer than that, the charges add up fast. It is meant to be taken out, ridden somewhere and docked within 30 min. It is $2/30 min after that. If you want to bike more, sign it out again and you get another 30 min free to go somewhere else..... So just remember to dock it every 30 min, as you go from site to site,memorial to museum. It really is very convenient. There is even an app that will tell you how many bikes are available at any given location. A couple other points- only 2 bikes are allowed per credit card, so for our family of four we needed 2 credit cards. Also, if there is a red light on the bike in the dock, it means it is broken and can't be signed out. Bottom line- use it as to and from transportation, dock it while you are in places, and enjoy!!

Your 1st 1/2 hour is free each time you rent a bike and then it is about $2 pp. for each 1/2 hr. after that. All you do to avoid the extra fee is ride less than 1/2 hour, dock the bike then re-rent. You get another fresh free 1/2 hour. According to the Bike share website 96% of DC members don't go over a 1/2 hr. ride. They have bike share stations all over the tourist area, the mall, downtown, Chinatown, etc. You can even rent them in Arlington. I would definitely recommend using the spot cycle app or capital bike share app because it lets you know how many bikes are available (or not available) at each station and where the stations are at. They are 3 speed, wide tire, wide seat mountain bikes with quick release seats and front and back automatic lights. DC's bike routes and paths are very easy to access and work great to avoid all the crowds walking on the sidewalks.

Thankfully, they \"kind of\" move aside when they hear the bell, which is thoughtfully provided on each bike. Second, be very aware of the pricing.

We had researched Capital City Bike Tours and knew the drill re the 30 minute 'free' period.We loved the freedom on the bikes and saved our legs, enabling us to cover a lot more ground. A couple of fishhooks that other travellers should be aware of. We visited 4 bike hire stands in Georgetown before we found some with spaces ( there were 4 of us) eventually we had to split up and return two while the others biked off to find another.) it was so hot we were very tetchy and over it by the time we did eventually get rid of our bikes and caught a taxi back to Foggy Bottom after dinner.The next day we picked up bikes again from Foggy Bottom and had planned to visit Arlington Cemeterey, when we arrived we were told no bikes in the cemetery and so we split up- two watched the bikes and two of us made a very quick visit, then we swopped over. Either Capital Bikes need a bike stand there or don't plan to visit by bikes . We got stung $22US when we eventually dropped the bikes back. To make matters worse , we couldn't get a second bike , to bike back to Foggy Bottom, the machine kept saying we had had the maximum (two per credit card) we think perhaps the person before us who had a problem with his bike hire may have got our ticket ??? anyway we walked back to our hotel. I hope the people at Capital Bikes take note of both our problems and perhaps are able to rectify for other clients . It is great service and I would use again but probably not to Georgetown in the weekend as due to no metro in the area the bikes are well used and racks all full. They do have a service which allows you an extra 15 minutes and tells you where there are spaces but by the time we biked there they were all taken. We didn't mind paying an extra $2 for the second half hour but we were just over 2 hours for the hire to Arlington and that was $22 each which was a bit steep for the students in our group.\"},\n",

We only bought a 3-day pass and for $28 for this family of four you can't beat it. I would highly recommend getting the bikeshare app, otherwise as a tourist you would be lost. I would also NOT recommend making your first tour use of this service for exploring the monuments at night. We, of course, did this and it's difficult to find the docking stations at night when you have a 30 minute window. Except for our run from the Archives Metro station to the Jefferson Memorial, this was an excellent way to see DC (our first run was too long for us since we were unfamiliar with the process and we almost didn't make it in the 30 minute time frame). Pros and Cons:Pro: If you want to have an easy way to get between memorials/sites and you don't want to have to worry about bringing a bike lock, this is perfect.Pro: Bikes were in good shape, easy to use (and to change seat height) and docking stations were convenientCon: You can only check out two bikes with one credit card, so it was a little time consuming to check the bikes out each time (had to use two credit cards and click though some questions).Con: Really this might just be for us, but we didn't bring helmets so we had to bike without themPro: Bike paths are very accessible and take you everywhere you'd want to go.Con: At night, we accidentally rode into the FDR memorial (thought we were still on path), the ranger was very polite in asking us to get off our bikes (we just felt terrible)Con: We wish the time frame was more like 45 minutes to an hour, but that might change the whole purpose of the bikeshare programAgain for a family of four (daughters 14 and 12), this was a great option.

The signs are very straight forward and tell you exactly what to do. If you want to ride a bike all over the city for one day you pay a $7 membership fee PLUS any additional time beyond 30 minutes. Their intention is to get people from point A to point B only, not to keep a bike all day. After you pay the membership fee, it's free to take a bike for 30 minutes, after that you pay $2 for 31-60 minutes, $6 for 61-90 minutes and then $8 for each additional 30 minutes! Yes, they are actually penalizing you for keeping a bike all day and rewarding you for returning a bike after 30 minutes! Just go from dock to dock like we did and it's all free (except for the membership fee). Who in their right mind thinks they can rent a bike for 24 hours (or more) for $7??There are tons of docking places throughout the city and you can very easily find a dock within the free 30 minutes. Dock your bike then get a new code and un-dock the same bike, it's that easy! We have been all over from Capitol Hill to Dupont Circle to Georgetown to Arlington and have only had to pay the initial membership fee! Sweet deal!I highly recommend the bikes, don't hesitate, just follow the simple guidelines and you'll see more monuments and sites than you can imagine.

To be fair, I am from Chicago and a member of the Divvy program which is run the same way so my familiarity with the system is high. I ended up explaining how the program worked to someone who was looking quizzically at the instructions on one station.Things to know:*You can buy a 24 hour or 3 day pass*This pass is good for unlimited use in that time frame however, you must redock your bike every 30 minutes in order to not be charged excess usage fees*You swipe a credit card to get started following the onscreen instructions*You will receive a 5 digit code which you can use to unlock any of the bikes at the station*Be aware that if a bike needs servicing, the seat may be turned around to show that it should not be selected*I suggest you set your seat height, numbered for future rental use, and any bags in the open sided basket before you enter the code to remove the bike*To remove the bike you may have to lift the rear of the bike to angle it out of its dock*Get on, make sure the bike work, watch for traffic and roll*Redock your bike, go back to the kiosk and reswipe your credit card to get a new release code to take a bike back out. The wait time to redock and get a new bike is about 30 seconds I believe. Use the same credit cardI highly recommend you download the free app SpotLab which will show you the location of other docks and offers a timer.I rode over to the National Mall and had a great time riding around, however I found that there was a surprising limitation of bike docks where I thought there should have been. There were no docks by the Vietnam Memorial and you cannot/should not bring your bike into any of the monuments anyway.There are a decent amount of bike lanes in DC that I would recommend riders use.The app said there was one open dock by the Lincoln Memorial, however when I got there and rechecked, there were in reality no open docks. I think there was an issue reading one of the bikes. I reswiped the previously used credit card to request 15 more minutes to try and find another open dock.I also used the bike to ride around various neighborhoods on my way back to DuPont circle area. It was a great way to see some of the homes, offices, consulates and was very enjoyable. However, always be a careful rider and obey your signals and stop signs. Nothing ruins a day more than ending up splat on the hood of a car, especially if you blew the right of way.'},\n",

I see some reviews about the site being misleading, it's not, you just need to read the instructions. They spell it out very clearly. NEED TO KNOW ABOUT RENTAL:If you read their website and understand how it works you'll be happy.* There are a few different options, getting a key or getting a code. Since we just rented one day so we did the code. Each time you want a bike you swipe the CC you reserved the bike on and it will print you out a code. You can choose a bike and go. * Understand the pricing structure. For the daily rental it was a $7.00 base charge. Each time you unlock a bike you get the first 30 minutes free and then an additional rate is charged for each section of time. Example: We rented and rode to the National Cathedral (and got lost) so it took us longer than 30 minutes, think it was about 55 minutes, we had an additional $2.00 charge for that specific trip since it took us 55 vs 30 minutes. The rest of the day we rented five more times (back to the mall and didn't get lost, around the tidal basin, up the mall and a few other stops in between) and there was no additional charges since we kept each trip to under 30 minutes. Over all we put on 28 miles and paid $9.00 for the day which I think it really reasonable.*There are bike racks all over the city, there's a great app to tell you how many bikes are available and how many slots are open. The BIKES:These are NOT commuter bikes, and they were a far cry from the road bike I am use to. They are heavy, there are only three speeds and they are built for ALL body types. I wouldn't plan on riding one out to Mt. Vernon by any means. But they are great around the city and mall and for stents under 10 miles. The bikes we had were all in good condition and were comfortable. They also do not come with helmets. If you stick to the trails it's not a bid deal, but riding up to the Cathedral was a little hair-raising in DC traffic. If your planning ahead pack a helmet. Great to see a program like this, very user friendly and a great way to see the sites.\"},\n",

This is very disappointing, as no one renting these bikes would have read through every single agreement written on those small screens before renting their bikes. It is unfair and this company is taking advantage of the fact that tourists would rent the bikes without reading each and every single page of agreements.

       "  'Entry_Content': \"The Capitol Bikeshare in Washington is one of the best that I've experienced. There are tons of stations around the city, and it's super easy to get around. It also helps that there are many bike trails and bike lanes, so there are designated spots for bikers. The city is very bike friendly because the population is mostly young and 40% of the people don't own cars. This means that the cars are also well aware of bikers and are used to them on the road, which helps.The way it works is this:1. Get a membership. It's $7/day or $15/3 days or more for longer periods (you can get a yearly or monthly membership also I believe)2. Use your credit card at any of the bike stations in the machines provided to buy the membership of your required length3. Once you buy the membership, you will get a 5 digit code. Use this code to enter on the little pad beside each bike. Once the light turns green, pull out your bike (sometimes have to use two hands)4. The membership allows you unlimited use of the bikes in (and this is the important part) - 30 minute intervals. This means that you will have no additional charges if you return the bike to another station within 30 minutes. The city is small enough that most places can be reached within the 30 minute limit. The point of this is to allow other people to use the bikes as well, and the bikes are meant as a form of getting from point A to point B, not keeping the bikes for the entire day (although you can do this, but you may end up paying hundreds of dollars, like the poor chap that called the service a scam below. It's not a scam - you just have to read the instructions properly. You are charged for every additional hour you don't return the bike). If you don't think you'll make it in time to your desired station, you may stop at another station and request additional time. You do this by inserting your credit card, and pressing the 'renew' button. This allows you an extra 15 minutes to get to the next station that is closest to your destination, or if the station you wanted is full and there is no space to leave the bike.5. If you require the bike for longer than 30 minutes, you may return to the station, wait 5 minutes (or walk to the next station) and get another bike, repeating the process above. The five digit code you get the first time will only be active for 5 minutes from the time you get it. Every time you want a new bike, you'll have to get a new code by inserting your credit card into the machine. Your credit card will not get charged again - it's only used to determine that you've already purchased a membership and to get a new code.6. Returning the bike, make sure you push it in hard into the stand, and make sure the green light comes on - this means the bike is locked back in.. 7. For those that have smart phones, you can download the Capital bike app (available on their website or from the app store) that will give you real-time information about how many bikes are available at each station or how many free spaces are available, so you don't have to waste time looking for the next available station if the one you want is full, or doesn't have bikes. It's also handy because it gives you the locations of all stations.There are many stations around the city and it's very easy to use and get around. In the three days that we rode around, there was only one instance where the station was full and we had to find the next one (5 minutes away - press the 'renew' button to get more time). Since we didn't have data services, we didn't have the real-time information for which stations were full/empty, but we could still see the station locations. We found that biking was more convenient and cheaper than the metro because there are more bike stations than there are metro stations, so it was easier to get closer to our desired destinations. Not to mention being able to get a better look at the city, and get some exercise.If you use the service properly, you'll have a great experience.\"},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': \"My wife and I made our first visit to D.C. the weekend following Labor Day for half a week and used Capital Bikeshare one day to get from our hotel at Dupont Circle to the National Mall. From the Mall, we headed off on the bikes to a lunch venue, then back to some Smithsonian museums, then around the Mall some more, and finally to a Metro station to head back to the hotel.The directions at each station are clear cut. Rental for the day is $7. Rental for 3 days is $15. You've got the use of the bikes for a 24 hour period if you rent for the day like we did. Every 30 minutes you must re-dock your bike at another station if you want to avoid additional fees, $2 for the next 30 minutes (31-60 minutes), $4 more dollars for the next 30 minutes (61-90) minutes. Payment options are credit or debit only. After docking your bike for the first time and ready to check another one out for another 30 minutes, you simply re-scan your credit/debit card at the pay station and follow the directions to retrieve your unlock code which is valid for 5 minutes. You don't get dinged each time you slide your card.You can dock a bike at a station and immediately check another one out too. There are docking stations all over the place, but a few times we couldn't find a station that was indicated on the online or station map, and many times we passed by stations that weren't on the maps at all. When I speak of these maps, I'm talking about the website and the ones at the pay/docking stations. There are no hard copy maps available. Since we don't have phones with internet capabilities, we felt lost on more than one occasion searching for another docking station. Reading other reviews, it sounds like their app is very helpful. However, we were always able to find another station within the allotted 30 minutes. A 45 minute allotment of time would be much better and leave the rider feeling much less rushed. If planning on using them to tour the memorials at the National Mall, you'll be very rushed or will have to skip stuff, dock the bike, and backtrack on foot. There's a station by the Washington Monument, one by the Jefferson Memorial, and one by the Lincoln Memorial on the west side of the mall where all of the memorials are.My wife had trouble with her seat staying put on a couple of occasions so make sure you grab a bike that has a seat that locks down tight. After sunset, we rode around the National Mall to see everything again, and that was great. The flashing LED headlights don't provide a ton of light however. The lights, I believe, are mostly there as a safety measure for you to be seen by others. There are other bike rental companies in town that offer usage for the entire day if that's what you're looking for. My wife used similar bikes in Boulder, CO earlier this year and had a bit friendlier experience than here in D.C. We'd certainly try these again, but would make sure we upgraded to a smart phone next time to make life considerably easier.\"},\n",

The app also has a rental timer to help return the bike within 30 mins to avoid rental charges.READ THE BOARD BEFORE RENTING!!! I have read a few reviews on here of people getting confused with the pricing and thinking they could keep the bike for the whole day for $7. It is not hard to understand and my husband and I found it very clear in the fact that the rental was $7 for 24 hours and during that 24 hrs if you returned bike within 30 mins it was free, and then it had the charges for if you returned after the 30 mins. simple! there are so many bike stations around that it was so easy to re dock the bikes within the 30 mins period, we never went over our time period and were not inconvenienced by having to re dock the bikes. Occasionaly we docked and re docked straight away to avoid charges if we were planning on riding a bit further.'},\n",

My husband discovered this unique, cost effective, \"enjoy at your own pace\" way to travel around the city during the busy Inauguration and again when we visited the city in the Spring! We were able to go places and experience sights that we would not have seen from a car. It was a totally amazing riding directly down the center of Pennsylvania Avenue, from the White House to Capitol Hill, since they had removed the traffic lights in preparation for the Inauguration. We explored the National Mall and Smithsonian Museums, the Washington Monument, Reflecting Pool, Lincoln Memorial, around the Tidal Basin with its many meaningful monuments, to the Jefferson Memorial. In the Spring, we explored the Arlington National Cemetery. It is easy to use the pick-up and drop-off kiosks, with many stations a short distance from one another. The bikes have three speeds and are simple to maneuver. I highly recommend giving this a try, because I am not a cyclist and had so much fun each time.'},\n",

       "  'Entry_Content': \"First off: hats off to any city that's doing its bit to promote this kind of transport system. Washington's heart is certainly in the right place. $7 for a day of travel around the sights of the National Mall and further afield to Arlington and Georgetown is certainly good value. To clarify: you have 30 minute window to get your bike docked into another station, not the 90 as one review has it, though you do get a 'safety' 15 minutes if you find all of the stations full when you reach your destination. Given that the metro is $2.70 a ride (when including the paper card) you can save yourself some money and sore feet with the bike.The bikes are simply and easy to ride, and you can get a reasonable shunt going if you're so inclined, though I'm not sure why you'd want to unless you're a DC commuter heading into work, and then why are you reading this?Here's the health warning: there are lots of tourists and bikes can become a premium in certain places (the Lincoln Memorial for example) so you can't expect to rock up and find one. The app is good, but doesn't update strictly in real time: by the time you reach the station the bikes might be gone. Some people are quite canny at dropping a bike then swiping for another 30 minutes, so pairs of bikes are sometimes hard to come by.Personally, I wouldn't plan a day around using a bike, especially if you have are under time pressure to get back somewhere, but if you can afford to be a bit more relaxed this might be a fun, and useful, bonus attraction.\"},\n",

You must return the bike every 30 mins or you will be charged an additional $2 or an additional $6 if you return within an hour. It was a great way to get around quickly as Washington is a big place, but trying to find a bus station became an issue a few times. We didn't have a map as we didn't have access to a computer, so we had to stop and ask a few times. Beware that 30 mins on the bike goes very fast and you may find yourself a long way away from another 'station'. Having a map should stop that from happening.

The bikes had lights that were suitable given the lighting available in the surrounding - but you might want to bring a flashlight or headlight if you choose to do a night ride. We kept the bikes longer than we expected - but the rate was no different than had we rented from a shop but we had flexibility. A note to one-day renters. You can get 2 bikes with one credit card - but if you need more than 2 bikes you need a DIFFERENT credit card and they only take Mastercard and Visa. Also - the bike security hold fee stayed on both my credit cards for about 5 days (I know this is not in Capital Bikeshare's control - but worth noting). The bikes have little baskets with a bungee that hold items fairly securely. The bikes are utilitarian and not meant for a comfy beach cruise or a cross-country tour - so be prepared for a hard ride. The bikes were in great shape and easily adjustable to our different heights.Note that if you do a mall ride at night - the mall can be quite busy even at night. We found that people were shocked to see bikes near the monuments and some thought it was a great idea and others told us that people should only walk to the monuments (and no we weren't pulling jumps off of Lincoln or anything like that, and we walked the bikes when we got to the monuments) - in any case the bikes seemed to garner a lot of attention.This was my husband's favourite part of our trip.And remember your helmet!\"},\n",

Visibility on the little LCD displays where you pay and get a code so you can unlock your bicycle is marginal at best, and under direct sunlight almost impossible to read.That being said, their bicycles are HORRIBLE. They have 3 speeds: slow, slower and barely moving, and steering is severely impaired. This makes for a very unsafe bicycle when you're moving in the middle of traffic. I don't know the statistics, but am almost surprised I didn't get into an accident while riding their clunker through DC streets. And I'm basically a bike commuter, not an athlete or a messenger. Keep that in mind if you decide to use the service.\"},\n",

I highly recommend using this program if you are on vacation and are going from sight to sight.'},\n",

So, put your credit card, in one of the hundred or so Capital Bikeshare stations, follow the instructions, and for a mere $7/day, you can bike the city. Pick up a bike in one spot and drop it off in another.
